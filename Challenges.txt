Challenges Faced
==================

Extracting ABSTRACT
	all text was not child of the main div class

Creating folder with actual html pages
	creating folders for year and month took me some time to figure out
	Took time to figure out how to get the html pages and move them to the correct folder for year and month

Learning curve with using htlm tags and attrinutes to extract data

Trouble finding how to create url using year and then for months and then looping thru every article for that month

Stripping text from the extracted html 

Removing from email the {at} symbol

Some journals did not have the fieldnames so had to account for them and not error out if no values being extracted

Reading the CSV file is recommended using DictReader since it is fast but getting IO error sometimes using it, hence used Pandas too
