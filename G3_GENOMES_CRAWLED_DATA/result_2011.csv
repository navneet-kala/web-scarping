1,"['Brenda J. Andrews', 'Paul W. Sternberg', 'Tracey DePellegrin Connelly']","June 1, 2011.",GSA Launches G3: Genes | Genomes | Genetics,,"b'We are proud to present the inaugural issue of G3: Genes | Genomes | Genetics, an open-access journal published by the Genetics Society of America (GSA). The journal\xe2\x80\x99s team of over 60 associate editors and 4 section editors, all practicing scientists\xe2\x80\x94your peers\xe2\x80\x94have come together to form a new, open-access journal with a unique mission and vision. The Editorial Board of G3 taps the expertise of the community of geneticists in the widest sense, from microbes to humans, from individuals to populations, and from classic \xe2\x80\x9cwet lab\xe2\x80\x9d experimentation to the most recent innovations in bioinformatics. Geneticists have never been more prolific, and there is no shortage of venues for presenting their discoveries. So why do we need yet another scholarly journal? We see two compelling reasons. First, because new sequencing and other technologies have greatly expanded the experimental reach of geneticists, we are now able to apply genetic analysis to species previously out of our range. Many of these and other studies may not be of wide interest or provide a significant mechanistic insight (yet), and thus are not appropriate for the broad audience of the GSA\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing, flagship journal GENETICS. We and the GSA Board of Directors saw the need for a journal to serve the genetics community by providing an outlet for dissemination of findings and experimental resources in genetics and genomics\xe2\x80\x94an outlet unrestricted by subjective editorial criteria of perceived significance or predicted breadth of interest. In brief, we are interested in publishing papers that describe useful, well-executed, and lucidly-interpreted genetic studies of all kinds. We recognize our responsibility to enable documentation of reagents and resources, description of foundational work in developing areas of genetics, and datasets for meta-analysis, to name a few. We see a need for a journal to provide a unified home for reporting genome sequences, genetic and physical maps of organisms, mutant screens, QTL mapping, and many other important and useful datasets. We also recognize the need to provide fair and rapid peer review and be a respected source of interesting papers\xe2\x80\x94a place where people want to publish their work. We\xe2\x80\x99ve launched G3 to fulfill these needs. Second, publication of data, ideas, and conclusions is the bedrock of science. We believe that practicing scientists must play a central role in that process. Many journals will publish our work, but few carry the imprimatur of an organization of peers with a long history of supporting our field. The Genetics Society of America has an illustrious record in scientific publishing with its groundbreaking journal GENETICS, the first American journal of genetics, established in 1916 by the founders of our field. G3, as a sister journal of GENETICS, will continue the tradition of science run by scientists. G3 will maintain a standard of quality to make the journal desirable, both for publication and for perusal. The data will be high-quality and the conclusions well-supported. The journal is focused on publishing results of genetic research\xe2\x80\x94research that encompasses a range of experimental analyses in established model systems, as well as investigations into less well-trodden genetic territory. G3\xe2\x80\x99s focus on genetics means that the editorial board can remain relatively small and respond to the needs of our community. The best journals offer innovative ways to present your work. For example, G3 (and GENETICS) provides links [within articles] to model organism databases, so with one click a reader can access a gene name and a wealth of associated information. In addition, we\xe2\x80\x99ve responded to our community by providing a forum where all data are available\xe2\x80\x94whereby researchers can drill deeper in their exploration for meaning. Beyond publishing research that meets our standards, G3 leaves it up to the community to determine its level of significance and utility. It\xe2\x80\x99s often impossible to predict whether an article will have widespread importance. This is the serendipity and joy of scientific discovery. And one of the best aspects of G3? After investing your resources and yourself in your research, you want a quick decision and prompt publication. G3 strives to offer a decision within 30 days of submission, and online publication within 45 days. G3 is fully open access, with a Creative Commons license that allows the freest use of the data: anyone can download, analyze, mine, and reuse the data provided that the authors of the article receive credit. We believe that rapid dissemination of useful data is the necessary foundation for analysis that leads to mechanistic insights. Our hope is that this strategy will spawn new discovery. And because the GSA journals have taken a leading role in ensuring full availability of all data related to an article, we pay more than just lip service to the meaning of open access. Submit your work for publication in the newest journal of the GSA and trust decisions made by your peers. Because your research is important to you, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to us.

Smith']","June 1, 2011.",An SNP-Based Linkage Map for Zebrafish Reveals Sex Determination Loci,"b'A surprising diversity of mechanisms controls sex determination of vertebrate organisms, even among closely related species. Both genetic and temperature-dependent systems of sex determination have been described in teleost fish. In the common zebrafish model organism, heteromorphic sex chromosomes are not observed, and the potential role of a genetic component of sex determination remains largely unknown. Here we report a genome-wide linkage study of sex determination in zebrafish using a novel SNP genetic map. We identified loci on zebrafish chromosomes 5 (LOD score 7.9) and 16 (LOD score 9.3) governing sex determination as a complex trait, rather than as an XY or ZW genetic system. Each of these loci contains a prominent candidate gene with a conserved role in sex determination across additional species that suggest potential mechanisms of sex determination in zebrafish. The chromosome 5 locus harbors dmrt1, a key gene in sex determination from fruit flies to humans; mutation of the human DMRT1 ortholog is a cause of complete sex reversal of XY individuals. The chromosome 16 locus harbors cyp21a2; mutation of the human CYP21A2 ortholog is one of the more common causes of pseudohermaphroditism. Mutation detection at each of these candidate genes within the zebrafish cross identified hypomorphic variants on the female-associated allele of each locus. The two loci together accounted for 16% of variance of the trait. Interacting environmental cues are likely to be an additional important component of sex determination in zebrafish.Over the prior two decades, the zebrafish has become an increasingly important vertebrate model organism. The power of this model organism as a genetic system is notable; with thousands of progeny in a single generation, the large number of recombination events can lead to the identification of loci underlying a trait with high statistical confidence. In this study, we sought to identify genes contributing to sex determination in zebrafish by genome-wide linkage analysis employing a novel SNP genetic map. No prior investigation has elucidated genetic sex determination (GSD) or identified sex-linked markers in the zebrafish. Although the zebrafish does not have heteromorphic sex chromosomes (Amores and Postlethwait 1999; Sola and Gornung 2001), the possibility of homomorphic sex chromosomes such as the X and Y of medaka fish remained (Matsuda et al. 2002). Alternatively, sex determination in zebrafish might result from the interaction of a more complex genetic system with environmental factors such as temperature. In some species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), key required genes prove to be the same as those required for GSD (Ferguson-Smith 2007; Marshall Graves 2008; Shoemaker-Daly et al. 2010). The mechanisms for their control appear to have evolved distinctly. Because different species of fish have evolved that represent both XY and ZW GSD, as well as TSD mechanisms, fish are particularly suited to the study of sex determination.'","b'A surprising diversity of mechanisms controls sex determination of vertebrate organisms, even among closely related species.

The mechanisms for their control appear to have evolved distinctly. Because different species of fish have evolved that represent both XY and ZW GSD, as well as TSD mechanisms, fish are particularly suited to the study of sex determination. Methods for SNP discovery have previously been described elsewhere in detail (Bradley et al. 2007). In brief, non-unique regions of the zebrafish genome assembly were identified using the BLAST algorithm to create a zebrafish repeat database. Clone sequence and whole genome shotgun sequence produced by the Danio rerio Sequencing Group at the Sanger Institute was obtained from online databases. Finished clones were masked using the repeat database, and were then compared to shotgun sequence by BLAST to identify sequence mismatches. Each variant was then scored to highlight those candidate SNPs with only two alleles that were seen in similar proportions, and at regions sampled with greater frequency. Polymorphism of candidate SNPs was evaluated within a sample of zebrafish comprised of: 1) the MGH cross G0 fish, 2) one male C32 and one male SJD fish, and 3) four males and four females from each of the strains AB, IN, TL, TU, and WIK. Among 5321 candidate SNPs successfully converting for assay, a score of \xe2\x89\xa54 corresponded empirically to an 86% validation rate; a score of \xe2\x89\xa56 corresponded to a 93% validation rate. All candidate SNPs of score \xe2\x89\xa54 have been submitted to dbSNP (ss48400959-ss49840083 and ss192416505-ss193075580, discontinuous). Frozen AB (n = 8), TL (n = 8), TU (n = 8), and WIK (n = 8) strain fish were provided by the Zebrafish International Resource Center (University of Oregon, Eugene, OR). Frozen IN (n = 8) population fish were provided by the Vanderbilt Zebrafish Core Facility. For each strain, half of the fish were of each sex. The fish of a given strain were offspring from 25 or more group matings of wild-type fish. Each group mating consisted of two females and three males. Frozen fish of each of the partially inbred strains SJD and C32 were provided by Dr. Stephen Johnson. Genomic DNA was extracted using the PureGene Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). DNA was quantified by PicoGreen assay (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). SNP genotyping was conducted using the commercial Illumina GoldenGate assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA). We obtained 99.2% of the genotypes for polymorphic SNPs. Five DNA samples from the MGH cross accounted for 99.4% of the missing data. These were omitted from analysis. For informative SNPs within the MGH cross, 446,994 of 451,360 genotypes (99.0%) were successfully obtained. The MGH cross design has been previously described (Knapik et al. 1996; Knapik et al. 1998; Shimoda et al. 1999). Briefly, a female AB strain fish originating from the University of Oregon zebrafish facility and a male India (IN) strain fish originating from a collection of wild fish from the northeast of India were mated to produce a single F1 pair, from which 790 F2 progeny were derived. A subset of 520 were selected for which DNA preparations were of high-quality; the 44 F2 progeny employed for the MGH linkage map were a subset of these. MapManager QTXb20 (Manly et al. 2001) was initially used to construct a comprehensive map of the SNP and STR markers, based upon the 44 fish with complete genotype data. This employed the Kosambi map function for the line cross and allowed for segregation distortion, with a P = 1.0E-6 threshold. R/qtl (Broman et al. 2003) was then used to refine marker order and estimate inter-marker distances, using the full set of 520 fish. This genetic map included both STR (1.2 cM resolution) and SNP (0.1 cM resolution) data. Linkage analysis to identify sex-determining loci was also conducted in the R/qtl environment, using a variant of interval mapping appropriate for a binary trait (Broman 2003). Statistical significance for linkage to sex was established via a permutation test (Churchill and Doerge 1994), with 10,000 permutation replicates. Percent phenotypic variance attributable to a locus was estimated by modeling the binary trait as continuous. Statistically unlikely events such as double crossovers in adjacent intervals or single crossovers in a small interval in both maternal and paternal meioses were identified using a maximum likelihood approach (Lincoln and Lander 1992). A total of 223 SNP genotypes (0.05%) at internal map loci were flagged as potential errors by calculating the LODerror. This rate matches the genotyping accuracy of the Illumina system. The SNP with the greatest number of potential errors had nine genotypes flagged. For STRs at internal map loci, a single genotype (0.001%) was flagged as a potential error. No markers were excluded on the basis of potential genotyping error. We noted seven regions in each of which STR marker order may be inverted with equal probability: pairs of vectors represented by STR markers of chromosomes 2 (Z9234 and Z4586, a 0.8 cM interval), 4 (Z9667 and Z45710, a 1.1 cM interval), 8 (Z14917 and Z28258, a 1.1-cM interval), 12 (Z3690 and Z7328, a 2.3-cM interval), 12 (Z9416 and Z22666, a 1.1-cM interval), 18 (Z9154 and Z25764, a 2.0-cM interval), and 25 (Z13622 and Z6924, a 1.1-cM interval). The merged SNP and STR map, and individual genotype vectors have been provided to the Zebrafish Information Network. Additional detail of the map and markers is available at http://dna.mc.vanderbilt.edu/zbase, and in Table S1. We estimated the recombination rate along the chromosomes (in cM per Mb) using a sliding window of 5 Mb, based upon the merged SNP-STR genetic map and the Zv9 draft assembly. The analysis is restricted to markers with concordant chromosomal assignment and order in the genetic and physical maps. Primers for a series of overlapping amplimers were designed such that the amplimers stair-stepped across Zv8 chromosome 5 from 43,945,234 bp to 44,017,451 bp, and chromosome 16 from 15,088,150 bp to 15,121,079 bp. The amplimer sets were filtered for the select subset encompassing dmrt1 and cyp21a2 exons, flanking intronic regions, and upstream sequence including the promoters. A BLAST-based algorithm in primer design specified unique amplification within the Zv8 assembly. One male and one female fish of the cross (each homozygous for the respective alternative alleles) were evaluated for variant detection by resequencing. Primer sequences are available from the authors upon request. The identified variants have been submitted to dbSNP (ss184963416-ss189156666 (dmrt1), and ss255538733-ss255540354 (cyp21a2), discontinuous). To facilitate genetic mapping of sex determination in zebrafish, we first created an SNP-based framework genetic map. We identified 1,174,978 candidate diallelic SNPs in 10,437 finished clones sequenced by Sanger, roughly one per kilobase of clone sequence. This resource roughly doubled the number of SNPs that we had previously identified (Bradley et al. 2007). We selected six candidate variants distributed across each of 875 clones to position the clones within a genetic map. We genotyped the candidate SNPs of the clones in an F2 intercross of 1040 meioses (the original 1996 MGH cross) (Knapik et al. 1996; Knapik et al. 1998; Shimoda et al. 1999). Of SNPs successfully assayed, 82% (3966) validated as polymorphic in the cross or in common laboratory strains (AB, IN, TU, TL, WIK, C32, SJD). The specific grandparental chromosomes of the cross were distinguished by 22% of the SNPs. These anchored a subset of 540 of the 875 clones on the genetic map, often redundantly with multiple informative SNPs per clone, totaling 618 unique loci (Figure 1 and supporting information, Table S1). The 1040 meioses of the cross provided a resolution of 0.1 cM. The mean density of the framework SNP map was 3.4 cM and the largest gap was 26.2 cM. An additional 2005 SNPs (polymorphic in the strains, but not informative in the cross) were located within the clones positioned on the framework genetic map. Thus the general resource for positional cloning in zebrafish is comprised of 2875 positioned SNPs (Table S2). An optimally informative zebrafish SNP genetic mapping panel and evaluation of the genetic ancestry of common laboratory strains are described in Figure S1, Figure S2, and Table S3. Unified SNP and STR genetic map of the zebrafish. The SNP map is comprised of 870 SNPs at 618 unique loci (blue tick marks) with a mean locus density of 3.4 Kosambi cM and resolution of 0.01 cM. The SNP genotype data were merged with data of 1989 STRs (red tick marks) of the MGH genetic map for creation of a combined map. The merged map is comprised of 1103 unique loci with a mean locus density of 2.0 Kosambi cM. Further detail of map markers and positions is provided in Table S1. The 44 zebrafish employed for creation of the MGH microsatellite (simple tandem repeat, STR) genetic map were a subset of the 520 employed to create the framework SNP genetic map (Knapik et al. 1998; Shimoda et al. 1999). This allowed us to subsequently distribute markers of the original MGH map into the higher-resolution SNP map. A total of 241 STRs were positioned at loci that were uniquely identified, and a total of 1748 STRs were positioned at loci that were each redundantly identified (e.g., two STRs with the exact same series of genotypes across the 44 F2 progeny identify the same locus). All STR loci were supported by LOD scores \xe2\x89\xa57. This strategy conservatively omitted markers with lesser statistical support in map construction. We observed no discordance of STR marker chromosomal assignment or order between this merged map and that of the original MGH map. The merged SNP-STR map has a mean genetic locus density of 2.0 cM, and largest gap of 16.0 cM (Figure 1 and Table S1). We evaluated recombination rate across the zebrafish genome based upon this map, presented in Figure 2. We observed a mean recombination rate of 1.60 cM/Mb for the zebrafish genome. By comparison, the mean sex-averaged recombination rate is 1.13 cM/Mb for human, and 0.63 cM/Mb for the mouse (Kong et al. 2002; Shifman et al. 2006). A high rate of recombination at all distal chromosomal arms is especially pronounced in zebrafish. Telomeric recombination rates reach roughly 2.5 cM/Mb in mouse, while rates often exceed 4 cM/Mb in zebrafish. Distal telomeric recombination suppression is also visible for many chromosomal arms. Recombination rate across the zebrafish genome. A comparison of the genetic map to the Zv9 physical map revealed that few markers were assigned to different chromosomes (1.4% of SNPs and STRs, 0.6% of SNPs, 1.0% of clones). We calculated LOD scores comparing the location of each of these markers in the assigned genetic chromosome to any location on the assigned physical chromosome. Genetic map position support LODs ranged from 12 to 228, while the physical map position support LODs ranged from 0 to 0.1. Other markers were positioned with a different relative order within a given chromosome of the genetic and Zv9 physical maps (7.2% of SNPs and STRs, 3.6% of SNPs, 5.8% of clones). We calculated LOD scores for each chromosome, comparing the marker order in the physical and genetic maps. These LOD scores ranged from \xe2\x88\x920.03 to \xe2\x88\x92319 (supporting genetic map order). Seventeen percent of the clones genetically positioned by SNPs were oriented by virtue of informative intra-clone recombination events in the cross; 13% of these had relative inverse orientations within the genetic and physical maps. Table S1 provides both genetic and physical map positions of each marker. Alternative explanations for the subset of discordantly positioned markers include error in either map, or large-scale structural polymorphism among different zebrafish populations. Structural polymorphism within the repetitive genome could confound physical assembly based upon clones of many individuals of a population, and could also fail to be evident within a genetic map based upon a single cross. The mapping cross provided substantial power to identify loci controlling sex determination in zebrafish. Of the 520 F2 sibling progeny, 219 were female and 248 were male (53 were of unknown sex). LOD scores for linkage to sex-determination identified two loci that exceeded genome-wide significance for linkage to sex (Figure 3), with nearly identical results for SNP or merged SNP-STR data. One locus resided on chromosome 5 at 53.8 cM with an LOD of 7.9 [near ss48808156 at 53.3 cM, 1.5 LOD drop interval ss48660708 (49.1 cM) to ss48502349 (61.1 cM)]. The other resided on chromosome 16 at 32.0 cM with a LOD of 9.3 [near ss48940970 at 30.4 cM, 1.5 LOD drop interval ss192546947 (28.9 cM) to ss48768171 (35.0 cM)]. More minor peaks are visible on chromosomes 6 and 25 (near ss192942334 and ss48734451, respectively), but neither reached statistical significance. Although these LOD scores were notably large, the LOD score anticipated in this cross if there were a single fully penetrant sex determination gene would have been \xe2\x88\xbc140. This contrast to the observed LODs highlights the complexity of sex determination in zebrafish. The loci on chromosomes 5 and 16 each explain a fraction of trait variance (7% and 9%, respectively). There was no evidence for an epistatic interaction between the two loci; together they are estimated to account for 16% of the trait variance. Alleles of the chromosome 5 locus appear to act in a recessive male (or alternatively, dominant female) fashion. Each allele of the chromosome 16 locus appears to act additively (one allele male, the other female). Figure 4 illustrates progeny sex relative to genotype combinations at these loci in the cross. All progeny (100%) that inherited fully male allele doses of these two loci were male; 77% of progeny that inherited fully female allele doses of these two loci were female (see also Table S4). Multipoint interval mapping of sex determination in zebrafish. LOD score results are plotted as a function of marker location in cM, with chromosomal number designated at the bottom of the plot. Dashed horizontal lines indicate significance thresholds (\xce\xb1) determined by permutation testing. Plot of the proportion of male progeny of the cross as a function of the alleles at the two major sex-determining loci in zebrafish. The B allele of chromosome 5 (originating from the IN strain male grandparent) corresponds to the male-associated allele of dmrt1, here marked by ss48808156 (T variant of the A/T SNP) in the cross. The A allele of chromosome 16 (originating from the AB strain female grandparent) corresponds to the male-associated allele of cyp21a2, here marked by ss48940970 (T variant of the T/C SNP) in the cross. The 95% confidence intervals of the proportion of males among zebrafish with a given two-locus genotype are illustrated for each data point. The closest flanking markers of the chromosome 5 sex-determining locus (ss48697105 and ss48960192) define a 1.7-cM interval corresponding to 2.2 Mb (Zv9 chromosome 5: 44,453,011 to 46,626,084 bp). Although many genes reside within this interval, one in particular was a candidate of immediate relevance: dmrt1. dmrt1 is the zebrafish ortholog of the doublesex gene, a bifunctional gene regulating both male and female sexual differentiation of the fruit fly. dmrt1 orthologs are the sex-determining genes of the Y chromosome of medaka and of the Z chromosome of birds (Matsuda et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2009). In humans, DMRT1 operates downstream of SRY in sex determination; haploinsufficiency of DMRT1 at 9p24.3 in humans results in sex-reversal of XY individuals (analogous to the recessive male model that we observed in zebrafish) (Muroya et al. 2000). Further, dmrt1 expression is governed by environmental temperature in some species with TSD (Shoemaker et al. 2007). In order to identify a dmrt1 allele that might guide sex determination in zebrafish, we resequenced the male- and female-associated alleles of dmrt1 within the cross. They were distinguished by a total of 162 SNPs, 28 indels, and two simple tandem repeats. We recognized two of these as functional candidates: the nonsynonymous D259E [ss184964113 at Zv9 chromosome 5: 46,608,201 bp, not in a highly conserved region of the protein (NP_991191)], and the central nucleotide of the cis-regulatory motif of the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 UTR (ss184964140 at Zv9 chromosome 5: 46,608,515 bp). The evolutionarily conserved 3\xe2\x80\xb2 UTR protein-binding motif has been shown to be responsible for dmrt1 transcript stability and translational efficiency, restricted to male gonad and germ cell development (Guo et al. 2005; Herpin et al. 2009). Mutagenesis data that defined the motif predicts that the female-associated allele, 5\xe2\x80\xb2-CUGCUACAGAU-3\xe2\x80\xb2, would yield lower dmrt1 expression relative to the male allele 5\xe2\x80\xb2-CUGCUGCAGAU-3\xe2\x80\xb2 in the developing gonadal primordium. Given the striking conservation of the role of dmrt1 in sex determination across evolutionary time, and linkage and mutation detection evidence, dmrt1 is a particularly good candidate of the chromosome 5 locus of the zebrafish cross. The closest flanking markers of the chromosome 16 sex-determining locus, ss48940970 and ss192790632, define a 3.5 cM interval corresponding to 4 Mb (Zv9 chromosome 16: 12,952,287 to 16,952,809 bp). Although many genes reside within the chromosome 16 locus, we recognized one in particular that is salient to the trait. The cyp21a2 (LOC793249) gene is 1.7 Mb from ss192790632. Mutations of the human ortholog of cyp21a2 cause an inborn error of sex development (pseudohermaphroditism). cyp21a2 encodes 21-hydroxylase, biosynthesizing corticosteroids. Cortisol exposure, as well as high temperature, can induce female-to-male sex inversion of genetically female (XX) medaka (Hayashi et al. 2010) and Japanese flounder (Yamaguchi et al. 2010). Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of corticosteroid biosynthesis prevents temperature-mediated inversion of genetically female medaka (Hayashi et al. 2010) and Japanese flounder (Yamaguchi et al. 2010) into males. In the protogynous grouper, 21-hydroxylase is activated in the transition of ovarian to testicular tissue during exogenous testosterone-mediated female-to-male sex inversion (Lee et al. 2002). Collective evidence suggested that cyp21a2 activity might guide sex determination of the developing zebrafish embryo. We resequenced the male- and female-associated alleles of cyp21a2 within the cross seeking variants that might influence 21-hydroxylase activity. The male- and female-associated cyp21a2 alleles were distinguished by a total of 176 SNPs and 24 indels. Potential copy number variation of the cyp21a2 gene (as can occur in humans) did not appear to confound variant discovery. Fish homozygous for the male or for the female alleles of the cross were homozygous at (and distinguished by) each of the discovered genetic variants. The female and male alleles differed at four amino acid positions conserved among orthologs of additional teleost fish (Figure S3). The male allele corresponded to the conserved residue at each of the four positions (male/XP_001919231 residue position/female: G141R (ss255539489 and ss255539495), V375M (ss255540264), Y380H (ss255540270), and V527A (ss255540330, Zv9 chromosome 16: 18,639,369 bp), suggesting that the female allele may have reduced function. V527 was additionally invariant across the mouse and human orthologs. These results are consistent with a potential role of relative 21-hydroxylase activity in ovarian or testicular fate specification in the zebrafish cross. In conclusion, we developed an accurate SNP genetic map of the zebrafish and applied it to identify a genetic component of sex determination. Our linkage results demonstrate that sex determination is a complex trait in zebrafish, not employing sex chromosomes. A number of candidate genes have previously been investigated with a role in sex differentiation in zebrafish, including: dnd (Zv9 chr 14), fancl (chr 13), cyp19a1a and b (chr 18 and 25), ff1a - d (chr 22, 8, 3, and 21), foxL2 (chr 15), sox9a and b (chr 12 and 3), wt1a and b (chr 25 and 18), and amh (chr 22) (Jorgensen et al. 2008; Kuo et al. 2005; Onichtchouk et al. 2003; Rodriguez-Mari et al. 2010; Rodriguez-Mari et al. 2005; Schulz et al. 2007; Siegfried and Nusslein-Volhard 2008; Trant et al. 2001; Uchida et al. 2004; Von Hofsten and Olsson 2005; Weidinger et al. 2003). Alleles at these loci did not statistically significantly contribute to sex determination within the cross. Instead, we identified two other loci on chromosomes 5 and 16 that statistically significantly contributed to sex determination. Zebrafish dmrt1 resides within the chromosome 5 locus; orthologs of this gene play key roles in sex determination of D. melanogaster, C. elegans, medaka fish, birds, and humans. A variant within the dmrt1 3\xe2\x80\xb2UTR regulatory element distinguished the male- and female-associated alleles of the zebrafish cross. Zebrafish cyp21a2 resides within the chromosome 16 locus. Current evidence among several fish species supports a key role for steroid hormones, both sex steroids and corticosteroids, in sex determination. Reduced 21-hydroxylase activity results in reduced corticosteroid biosynthesis, potentially resulting in a shunt of precursors toward sex steroid biosynthesis. Mendelian mutations of the human CYP21A2 ortholog are a cause of virilization of males and of females (pseudohermaphroditism). Mutations of human CYP21A2 result in androgen excess, the most common cause of ambiguous external genitalia in the newborn. However, the predicted hypomorphic zebrafish allele (concurrent change of four evolutionarily-conserved amino acids) is that of the female, rather than the male. Prior experiments demonstrating a role for corticosteroids in male development of both medaka and flounder are consistent with a male-associated zebrafish allele of preserved 21-hydroxylase activity, and female-associated zebrafish allele of reduced activity. Corticosteroid-mediated transcriptional suppression of genes that are active in female fish development, such as fshr (Hayashi et al. 2010), might underlie the apparent paradox between the human and the fish systems of sex determination. Alternatively, testosterone excess (resulting from reduced CYP21A2 activity) as a precursor may be converted to estradiol by aromatase, rather than to active dihydrotestosterone by steroid 5-alpha reductase. It is conceivable that the former pathway may predominate in zebrafish. Note that 17-alpha methyltestosterone treatment of embryonic zebrafish skews to male development (Westerfield 1994), but the synthetic androgen is also an aromatase inhibitor (Fenske and Segner 2004). Because the two loci each contribute a relatively small proportion of the variability of this trait, experimental demonstration of causality of the identified alleles may be difficult due to expected incomplete effects on biological sex determination. Based upon current knowledge, complete abrogation of function of each candidate gene may have marked effects on sex determination. However, that would not conclusively establish the identified alleles of either gene as the source of the linkage signal within the cross. Another experimental limitation is posed by the observed complex nature of this trait. Traditional interval mapping is suitable for positional cloning of Mendelian mutations, but would not be fruitful here because a given fish with a recombination event that might narrow a critical interval may, due to incomplete penetrance, be of either sex. Lack of one-to-one correlation between the trait and either locus would confound such an effort. Given current evidence, both dmrt1 and cyp21a2 are very good candidates as genes potentially underlying the linkage signal of the cross, and further work is warranted to evaluate biological causality. Within the AB and IN strains, as well as other zebrafish populations, additional alleles of these and other genes may be found that collectively account for a greater extent of the variability of this complex trait. The SNP mapping panel derived from our work may be useful in further investigation of additional crosses. Additional complex genetic factors and environmental cues are likely to interact in zebrafish sex determination, and remain to be elucidated.

We present improved genome sequences of three species of Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts: S. bayanus var. uvarum (CBS 7001), S. kudriavzevii (IFO 1802T and ZP 591), and S. mikatae (IFO 1815T), and describe their comparison to the genomes of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. The new sequences, derived by assembling millions of short DNA sequence reads together with previously published Sanger shotgun reads, have vastly greater long-range continuity and far fewer gaps than the previously available genome sequences. New gene predictions defined a set of 5261 protein-coding orthologs across the five most commonly studied Saccharomyces yeasts, enabling a re-examination of the tempo and mode of yeast gene evolution and improved inferences of species-specific gains and losses. To facilitate experimental investigations, we generated genetically marked, stable haploid strains for all three of these Saccharomyces species. These nearly complete genome sequences and the collection of genetically marked strains provide a valuable toolset for comparative studies of gene function, metabolism, and evolution, and render Saccharomyces sensu stricto the most experimentally tractable model genus. These resources are freely available and accessible through www.SaccharomycesSensuStricto.org.Hemiascomycete yeasts (subphylum Saccharomycotina) have emerged as a preeminent phylogenetic clade for comparative genomics due to their small, streamlined genomes, a wealth of functional data, and genetic diversity spanning 500\xe2\x80\x931000 million years of evolution (Dujon 2010; Dujon et al. 2004; Piskur and Langkjaer 2004; Taylor and Berbee 2006). Although low-to-medium-coverage genome sequences of many species in this group have been determined (Scannell et al. 2007a), relatively few are complete and well-annotated (Dujon 2010). Most studies have focused on large-scale evolutionary changes, such as the whole-genome duplication that occurred within the Saccharomyces complex of species (Wolfe and Shields 1997; Dietrich et al. 2004; Kellis et al. 2004; Scannell et al. 2006; Scannell et al. 2007b; Wapinski et al. 2007b). Broad comparative analyses have been critical to our understanding of how genomes evolve over long time scales, and for describing what makes fungi distinct from plants and animals. Determining the genetic bases for more recent and rapid evolutionary changes within and between species remains an area of active research across many phyla (Atwell et al. 2010; Peichel 2005; Prud'homme et al. 2007; Seidel et al. 2008), for which unfinished genome sequences have proven inadequate. Comparative genomic analyses of entire genera greatly facilitate evolutionary research, but few genera have the resources\xe2\x80\x94both genetic and genomic\xe2\x80\x94required to support such work (Clark et al. 2007; Butler et al. 2009). Smaller-scale comparative studies in yeast have already provided mechanistic insights into key evolutionary concepts, such as speciation (Chou et al. 2010; Greig et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2008; Greig 2009), life history variation (Gerke et al. 2009), cis-regulatory evolution (Fay and Benavides 2005; Fidalgo et al. 2006), conditional-fitness tradeoffs (Will et al. 2010), and the long-term maintenance of complex genetic variation (Hittinger et al. 2010). Further, comparative analyses of species closely related to a classical model organism can reveal regulatory pathways not readily discoverable in a single \xe2\x80\x9cmodel\xe2\x80\x9d species (Zill and Rine 2008), provided genetic tools exist in the \xe2\x80\x9cnonmodel\xe2\x80\x9d species. Next-generation genomics technologies make the sequencing of entire genera labor- and cost-efficient, bridging the gulf between research on an established model organism and comparative research on its relatives. Endowing several con-generic species with the genetic prowess of their classical model relative would revolutionize the study of the genetic basis of evolution by allowing reciprocal experiments across a model genus. Although the genome sequences of several species within multiple eukaryotic genera have been determined (e.g., Stein et al. 2003; Clark et al. 2007; Rokas et al. 2007; Butler et al. 2009), none of these are amenable to nucleotide-level targeted reciprocal genetic analyses between a classical model organism and multiple close relatives. The Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus, which includes the model organism S. cerevisiae, offers a unique opportunity. This clade includes at least five other natural species\xe2\x80\x94S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. arboricolus, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus\xe2\x80\x94and one hybrid species\xe2\x80\x94, S. pastorianus (Figure 1A) (Naumov et al. 2000; Wang and Bai 2008; Nakao et al. 2009). (We note that a recent study provides strong evidence that S. bayanus var. bayanus and S. bayanus var. uvarum are genetically and ecologically isolated sister species from two distinct lineages (Libkind, Hittinger, et al., unpublished data). The genomics and genetics communities have used S. bayanus to refer to S. bayanus var. uvarum, and we continue that convention here.) The Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus is thought to have evolved \xe2\x88\xbc20 million years ago, and its species have a level of nucleotide divergence similar to that found between birds and humans (Dujon 2006). However, because yeasts lack a fossil record, the estimation of absolute divergence times for any set of yeast species is imprecise (Taylor and Berbee 2006). The genomes of S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus were originally sequenced to low-medium coverage (3-8\xc3\x97) (Cliften et al. 2003; Kellis et al. 2003). These sequence assemblies were far from complete with N50 values (i.e., the minimum contig/scaffold length above which 50% of the entire assembly is contained in contigs or scaffolds equal to or larger than this value) well below 100 kb (as low as 11 kb for S. kudriavzevii). Due to the large number of gaps in each genome sequence, fewer than half of the potential orthologs of S. cerevisiae genes (2742/6615) were fully assembled and annotated across all four con-generic species. The missing data have both limited comprehensive sequence-based evolutionary analyses, and forced individual investigators to perform targeted resequencing to support sequence and genetic analyses of specific genes (Guan et al. 2010; Zill et al. 2010; Hittinger et al. 2004; Airoldi et al. 2009; Gallagher et al. 2009). To facilitate evolutionary genetic and genomic analyses within the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus, we resequenced to high coverage and reassembled the genome sequences of S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus. With these new genome sequences, an improved assembly of the S. paradoxus genome (Liti et al. 2009), and the reference genome of S. cerevisiae (Goffeau et al. 1996), we determined the average and branch-specific evolutionary rates for a revised set of 5261 complete, annotated protein-coding orthologs across five Saccharomyces species, and identified 123 genes that may have been targets of positive selection. Through a relaxed-clock phylogenetic analysis, we obtained more accurate and precise relative estimates of interspecies divergence. Finally, we derived marked laboratory strains of the three species, permitting comparative genetic experiments at an unprecedented level of phylogenetic resolution and power within the Saccharomyces genus.""","b""High-quality, well-annotated genome sequences and standardized laboratory strains fuel experimental and evolutionary research.

(A) Schematic showing phylogenetic relationships among nonhybrid members of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus plus the outgroup Kluyveromyces lactis based on (Kurtzman and Robnett 2003), (Nieduszynski and Liti 2011), and (Libkind, Hittinger et al., unpublished data). Branch lengths are not proportional to sequence divergence. The branch on which the whole-genome duplication occurred is marked. (B) Schematic depicting co-assembly of genomes from Illumina short-insert paired-end reads and mate-pair Sanger shotgun reads. Illumina reads were used to build contigs, which were stitched into scaffolds using mate-pair reads from the longer-insert Sanger libraries. Scaffolds were then joined into ultra-scaffolds (contiguous with chromosomes) using MEGABLAST and manual scaffold ordering. The genomes of S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus were originally sequenced to low-medium coverage (3-8\xc3\x97) (Cliften et al. 2003; Kellis et al. 2003).

Through a relaxed-clock phylogenetic analysis, we obtained more accurate and precise relative estimates of interspecies divergence. Finally, we derived marked laboratory strains of the three species, permitting comparative genetic experiments at an unprecedented level of phylogenetic resolution and power within the Saccharomyces genus. Paired-end Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared from sonicated or nebulized genomic DNA according to manufacturer protocols with certain modifications (Hittinger et al. 2010; Lefrancois et al. 2009). For S. bayanus, a MATa ho\xce\x94::NatMX derivative of CBS 7001 was sequenced. For S. mikatae, sheared DNA isolated from strain IFO 1815T was processed by an IntegenX robot. For S. kudriavzevii, haploid derivatives FM1097 and FM1109 were sequenced. Mean insert sizes (\xc2\xb1SD) of Illumina libraries, as determined by SOAPdenovo, were as follows: IFO 1815T, 259 bp (\xc2\xb176 bp); IFO 1802T, 203 bp (\xc2\xb120 bp); ZP 591, 226 bp (\xc2\xb123 bp); CBS 7001, 437 bp (\xc2\xb145 bp). Sequencing was performed on Illumina Genome Analyzer II or IIx machines at the Vincent Coates Genome Sequencing Lab, QB3, Berkeley, CA and at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. Read lengths varied for each strain as follows: S. bayanus, 51 bases; S. mikatae, 80 bases; S. kudriavzevii, 114 bases. All raw read data have been deposited in the SRA at NCBI (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) in SRP006340 of SRA034902. Reads, assemblies, and annotation files are freely available at http://www.SaccharomycesSensuStricto.org. Sanger reads were quality trimmed using LUCY (Chou and Holmes 2001) (default parameters, except \xe2\x88\x92minimum 60). Vector sequences at the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of reads were masked using Figaro (White et al. 2008) (default parameters). Reads where more than 20% of bases were determined to be of vector origin were discarded; all others were 5\xe2\x80\xb2 trimmed and retained. Reads with remaining significant homology to the NCBI UniVec database (downloaded June 12, 2009) detected by Crossmatch (Ewing and Green 1998) (default parameters) were discarded. Reads shorter than 60 bp and unpaired reads were discarded. Reads were 3\xe2\x80\xb2 trimmed to a maximum of 180 bp. Illumina reads were quality trimmed using fsq2fsa (available from D. Scannell on request), which trims bases from the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends of reads based on the Illumina quality score in small windows. The quality score was optimized for each dataset by assembling all reads with SOAPdenovo (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html; Version 1.05; July 29, 2010) (default params; \xe2\x88\x92K = 31) and selecting the assembly with the best N50 (other metrics produced similar results). In addition, we used fsq2fsa to eliminate reads with significant matches to Illumina adapters and used the SOAP Corrector (default parameters) tool to correct errors in reads. We did not hard trim bases from the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends of reads because doing so did not improve assemblies. Assemblies were generated using SOAPdenovo (default parameters except \xe2\x88\x92K as described below) using Illumina reads for both contig generation and scaffolding (rank = 1, pair_num_cutoff = 3, asm_flags = 3, map_len = 32) and Sanger reads for scaffolding only (rank = 2, pair_num_cutoff = 3, asm_flags = 2, map_len = 32). Sanger libraries of different origins were supplied to SOAPdenovo separately and the insert sizes for each determined by BLASTing against contigs longer than 10 kb. We optimized the \xe2\x88\x92K parameter (Kmer) separately for each assembly by examining a range of values in the range 17\xe2\x80\x9361. Finally, we used the SOAP GapCloser tool (default parameters) to fill assembly gaps using Illumina reads only. Our new assemblies as well as previously published sequences for S. cerevisiae (Engel et al. 2010; Goffeau et al. 1996) and S. paradoxus (Liti et al. 2009) were all annotated with a common pipeline. We used HMMER 1.8.4 (http://hmmer.janelia.org/software/archive) to detect high scoring matches to an HMM created from an alignment of S. cerevisiae introns and flanking sequences. We then generated all ORFs above a context-dependent minimum size (60 bp at contigs ends and intron splice-sites, 300 bp at other locations), combined these with the putative splice-sites and selected the most upstream ATG as the putative start codon. Initially, we retained only possible gene models longer than 300 bp. Shorter genes were later recovered by extending BLAST HSPs (described below). Following this procedure, potential ORFs that spanned high-scoring matches to the splice site model were represented by multiple alternative gene models. At each locus, we aligned alternative models to the best available homolog (typically from S. cerevisiae) using Exonerate (Slater and Birney 2005) (\xe2\x88\x92model affine:global \xe2\x88\x92exhaustive 1 \xe2\x88\x92bestn 1) and selected the model with the highest score. We sought positive evidence for all remaining gene models by BLASTing (Altschul et al. 1997) against a local database of yeast proteins assembled from completely sequenced yeast genomes (Wood et al. 2002; Cliften et al. 2003; Dujon et al. 2004; Kellis et al. 2004; Souciet et al. 2009), the NCBI nr protein database, and S. cerevisiae Ty and LTR sequences downloaded from Saccharomyces Genome Database (Engel et al. 2010) (SGD, http://www.yeastgenome.org). In addition, we used HMMER3 (Eddy 2009) to search our gene models against a database of 4704 protein HMMs derived from the Yeast Gene Order Browser (Byrne and Wolfe 2006) (YGOB, http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/ygob). In order to recover small genes or rapidly evolving genes, we subjected all presumed intergenic regions to low stringency BLAST searches against our local database of yeast proteins and searched genomic regions predicted by synteny to contain YGOB matches with our YGOB-HMM library. To detect potential novel genes, we used linear discriminant analysis to assign ORFs lacking homology to genes in the YGOB or yeast ortholog databases a \xe2\x80\x9ccoding probability\xe2\x80\x9d based on whether their codon usage frequencies more closely resembled confirmed protein-coding genes or confirmed intergenic regions. Finally, we eliminated poorly supported gene models that overlapped well-supported models and merged neighboring models that were likely to be fragments of the same gene. The fragmented gene models were typically created by scaffold gaps or frameshifts (either real or due to sequencing errors). The remaining models were stratified according to the quality of the supporting evidence and comprised our initial protein-coding gene set. We used tRNA-ScanSE to identify tRNA genes (Lowe and Eddy 1997). As described in more detail below (Ortholog Detection and Assignment), we identified putative orthologs among the genomes of five species\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9crepresentative\xe2\x80\x9d strains (i.e., S. mikatae IFO 1815T, S. kudriavzevii IFO 1802T, S. bayanus CBS 7001, S. cerevisiae S288C, and S. paradoxus CBS 432T). We used interspecies comparisons to improve annotations for these five strains in two ways. First, where intron\xe2\x80\x93exon structures differed among species, we used Exonerate (\xe2\x88\x92model protein2genome \xe2\x88\x92exhaustive 0 \xe2\x88\x92bestn 1) to perform a multiframe alignment of the closest homologous protein to the genomic region around each gene. Resulting models were preferred if they improved the consistency among species and typically contained small (2-7 bp) first exons or multiple frameshifts. Second, we aligned the putative 5\xe2\x80\xb2 termini and upstream regions of genes and selected the start codon that minimized the variation among species while maximizing overall gene length. We detected single-copy orthologs among the five strains using a two-step procedure that incorporates both homology and synteny at both steps. First, we grouped genes across all species into families according to the best match in our YGOB-HMM database. Within each family, we selected the species with most representatives and founded an orthology group (or \xe2\x80\x9corthogroup\xe2\x80\x9d) with each copy. We then assigned genes from other species to orthogroups if they exceeded the specified minimum level of synteny support and the level of support for the next best orthogroup was significantly less. To compose a synteny statistic, we counted the number of YGOB-HMM families that were shared between a ten-gene window centered on the query gene and one centered on the focal orthogroup. We computed the hypergeometric probability of this observation assuming a total genome-size of 4704 genes (the number of YGOB models that can be distinguished) and used \xe2\x88\x92log10(Phyper) as our synteny statistic. Once all possible genes in a family were assigned to orthogroups, five-membered orthogroups were considered complete and removed. Remaining family members were then assigned to the remaining incomplete orthogroups and the procedure iterated until steady state. Once our initial set of orthogroups was defined we looked in the genomic regions between orthogroups for additional sets of syntenic orthologs that were not related to any of the YGOB-HMM families or had been missed for lack of synteny or other reasons. If orthologs were present at a genomic location in only a subset of species, we reannotated the syntenic region in the un-represented species to recover any missed orthologs. Finally, we re-examined all orthogroups and rejected those that exhibited either weak synteny or weak homology support. Orthologous genes were aligned in protein-space with FSA (Bradley et al. 2009) and back-translated to DNA using RevTrans (Wernersson and Pedersen 2003). A comparison of gene structures and lengths suggested at least 4792 (\xe2\x88\xbc87%) of our orthologous gene sets were of high quality (Table S1). To assess how improved genome sequences facilitated thorough evolutionary analyses, we determined the number of the single-copy orthologs present in the original 2003 genome annotations, which were not published jointly (Kellis et al. 2003, Cliften et al. 2003). We considered the more complete Kellis et al. 2003 annotations for S. bayanus, S. paradoxus, and S. mikatae; the Cliften et al. 2003 annotations for S. kudriavzevii; and the S. cerevisiae annotations as downloaded from SGD on February 13, 2008. Annotations were taken to designate orthology if the original authors used the systematic name for S. cerevisiae gene along with the systematic name for the species in question in the versions deposited in SGD. As before, this analysis yielded 2805 genes with orthologs previously designated in all five Saccharomyces sensu stricto species (Hittinger et al. 2010). However, the Kellis et al. nomenclature allowed multiple genes to be named for the same S. cerevisiae gene (e.g., lineage-specific duplicates that are all orthologous to a single S. cerevisiae gene). Excluding these genes, only 2742 genes were actually annotated as single-copy (1:1:1:1:1) orthologs in the 2003 genomes. To construct a data matrix for codon-based analyses, we first filtered out all ortholog groups from the new assemblies that did not contain orthologs from all five species as well as any ortholog groups in which more than 75% of alignment columns had missing data or gaps. The resulting data matrix was composed of 5152 orthologs and contained 7,880,523 nucleotide columns (the average length of a coding sequence alignment was \xe2\x88\xbc1530 base pairs). We examined variation in selection pressure along branches of the species tree and tested each gene for evidence of positive selection using the CODEML module from PAML (Yang 2007). To examine selection pressure variation along branches of the species tree for each gene, we evaluated the log likelihood of two alternative hypotheses relative to the null hypothesis H0, under which all branches of the phylogeny exhibited the same \xcf\x89 ratio of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions (Figure 2A). The first set of alternative hypotheses (H1) stated that the \xcf\x89 ratio along the external branch for a given species was different from that in the rest of the branches of the phylogeny (Figure 2A). To discriminate between genes that were consistent with a different \xcf\x89 ratio only along a particular species from genes that were consistent with distinct \xcf\x89 ratios in all branches of the phylogeny, we also tested the second alternative hypothesis (H2), in which each lineage exhibited its own \xcf\x89 ratio against the H0 hypothesis (Figure 2A). To test for positive selection in each gene, we first evaluated the log likelihood of the null M7 model. Under M7, \xcf\x89 values at different codon positions in a gene follow a beta distribution, where \xcf\x89 is constrained to fall between zero and one. We then compared the log likelihood of the M7 model relative to that estimated by the alternative model M8, which, in addition to the zero to one beta distribution for \xcf\x89 values, also allows for a subset of codon sites to have \xcf\x89 values above one. We excluded all genes with dS values of zero. All tests were done at P = 0.01 significance. In File S1, we have also provided an optional filter to remove genes from these screens whose high \xcf\x89 values were driven by abnormally low denominators (i.e., dS values two standard deviations below the mean). Depending on the specific alternative hypothesis, application of the filter removes \xe2\x88\xbc5\xe2\x80\x9310% of the genes rejecting H0, including many genes encoding ribosomal proteins and other translation factors that are not likely to be experiencing lineage-specific selection. Genes exhibiting lineage-specific rates of evolution in the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus. (A) The three alternative hypotheses designed to test whether genes are evolving at a different rate in each of five species of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus. Under hypothesis H0 all branches of the tree exhibit the same \xcf\x89 ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions. Under the set of H1 hypotheses, the \xcf\x89 ratio along a given species\xe2\x80\x99 branch is different from that along all other branches of the tree. Under the H2 hypothesis, each branch exhibits its own \xcf\x89 ratio. (B) Numbers of genes with lineage-specific rates of evolution in the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus. We inferred relative divergence times for the yeast phylogeny using the BEAST software, version 1.6.1 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007) on a data set of 106 genes spanning the yeast genome (Rokas et al. 2003). Because the fungal and yeast fossil records are sparse and reliable fossil calibration points unavailable, we estimated all branches in units of substitution/site. For all phylogenetic analyses using BEAST, we assumed the SRD06 model of sequence evolution (Shapiro et al. 2006), allowing for rate heterogeneity across sites through the gamma distribution, and the uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock model. We chose the Yule process as our tree prior. We ran three independent runs for 10,000,000 generations. We verified the convergence of runs by examining the effective sample size of the likelihood and posterior probability parameters for each analysis (>100 parameters) and by visually inspecting the likelihood and posterior probability distributions across independent runs. We discarded the first 10% of sampled data points from each run as burn-in. We used a variety of approaches to identify gene gain and loss candidates that we subsequently manually inspected. First, we took a synteny-based approach to identify genes that were lost or gained in internal chromosomal regions with well-conserved synteny. Briefly, we \xe2\x80\x9cwalked\xe2\x80\x9d along the genome of S. cerevisiae and checked the region between each orthogroup (conserved 1:1:1:1:1 syntenic orthologs) and the previous orthogroup for the presence of genes in one or more species. We excluded regions that contained assembly gaps in any of the five species or where there were more than three intervening features in any species. As these criteria were restrictive, we also took a homology-based approach, grouping genes by their homology to YGOB-HMM families and selecting families that differed in size among species (but excluding the small number of very large families). In addition, we examined any genes that had evidence of function (see Genome annotation) but which had no detectable homology to either a YGOB-HMM or to a gene in SGD. Finally, we also sought to identify cases where although a gene was detectable by homology, the reading-frame had been disabled. To do this, we sorted genes by the number of frameshifts required to reconstitute a full-length gene during the annotation process and examined any gene with three or more disruptions. We also sorted orthogroups by the standard deviation of gene length divided by the mean gene length and examined the top 200 outliers to detect genes that had been severely truncated. Prototrophic diploid yeast strains CBS 7001, IFO 1802T, ZP 591, and IFO 1815T were made heterothallic by inactivating the HO gene. HO/ho\xce\x94 heterozygous diploids were sporulated and tetrads were dissected to isolate MATa and MAT\xce\xb1 ho\xce\x94 haploids. For S. mikatae and S. kudriavzevii, auxotrophic markers were generated by gene targeting. For S. bayanus, auxotrophic markers were introduced by EMS mutagenesis as described previously (Zill and Rine 2008). To generate the S. kudriavzevii trp1\xce\x940 and ura3\xce\x940 delitto perfetto alleles, prototrophic strains were transformed with DNA oligos and/or PCR products encoding a direct junction of the sequences immediately upstream of the start codon and downstream of the stop codon (Storici et al. 2001). Transformed pools were grown on 5-FAA and 5-FOA media to select for strains that lack functional TRP1 and URA3, respectively. All other homologous-recombination-based gene targeting was performed by one-step gene replacement using standard drug-resistance cassettes (Guldener et al. 1996; Longtine et al. 1998; Goldstein and Mccusker 1999) or standard two-step replacements using URA3 (Storici and Resnick 2006). All gene disruptions were confirmed using PCR and/or sequencing to examine the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends of targeted ORFs. Transformation protocols for S. bayanus (Zill and Rine 2008; Gallagher et al. 2009) and S. kudriavzevii (Hittinger et al. 2010) have been described. Here we again summarize the relevant modifications to the standard PEG/LiAc heat-shock protocol used for S. cerevisiae transformation. All of the non\xe2\x80\x93S. cerevisiae species appear to be quite sensitive to prolonged heat shock at 42\xc2\xb0C. For S. bayanus, heat shock was performed for five minutes at 42\xc2\xb0C after a 10-minute incubation at room temperature in the transformation mixture. For S. kudriavzevii, heat shock was performed for 30 min at 34\xc2\xb0C. For S. mikatae, heat shock was performed for five minutes at 37\xc2\xb0C after a 10-minute incubation at room temperature. For all three species, subsequent outgrowth and culture were performed at room temperature (\xe2\x88\xbc23\xc2\xb0C). For S. bayanus, gene disruption primers contained 40nt homologous to the sequences immediately flanking the targeted ORF. For S. mikatae and S. kudriavzevii the primers had 50 nt and 70 nt of homology, respectively. The taxonomic type or other representative strains of S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus were previously sequenced to 3-8\xc3\x97 coverage with Sanger sequencing technology (Cliften et al. 2003; Kellis et al. 2003). Though this depth of sequencing provided value in terms of genome coverage, and where coverage was highest provided good long-range continuity (Cliften et al. 2006), the resulting assemblies had many gaps and a moderate number of errors. To obtain more complete assemblies that would support base-pair level analyses of these three species, we sequenced short-insert (203-437 bp) Illumina paired-end libraries to greater than 100\xc3\x97 coverage (Table 1) and assembled these together with the available sequences (Figure 1B). The high raw coverage afforded by the short-read technology minimized erroneous base calls and gaps in unique regions, whereas the longer inserts from the shotgun sequencing projects (3198-4789 bp inserts; trimmed reads averaged 179 bp in length) helped bridge repetitive regions and establish long-range scaffolds. In addition, we sequenced and assembled a genetically and phenotypically diverse S. kudriavzevii strain (ZP 591) (Sampaio and Goncalves 2008) from Illumina reads only, as there were no Sanger shotgun reads available. We aggressively trimmed, corrected, and discarded lower quality reads and assembled those satisfying our quality control criteria using SOAPdenovo (Li et al. 2010) and a custom parameter optimization strategy (see Materials and Methods). The resulting assemblies exhibited comparable total base counts (Table 2), suggesting that each had converged on the similar physical genome sizes that were predicted by karyotyping and other studies (Fischer et al. 2000; Naumov et al. 2000; Gonzalez et al. 2008). Indeed, the assemblies\xe2\x80\x99 size range of 11.6\xe2\x80\x9311.9 Mb was close to the completed S. cerevisiae genome size (12.1 Mb) and bracketed that of the ostensibly completed S. paradoxus (Liti et al. 2009) (11.7 Mb) assembly, suggesting that our assemblies were essentially complete. The new assemblies also had many fewer gaps and greatly improved continuity compared to the originally published versions. For instance, our unordered S. mikatae assembly consisted of 1220 scaffolds, of which 159 were longer than 500 bp, and many of the shorter ones were likely to be spurious byproducts of the short-read assembly process. Notably, those 159 scaffolds accounted for >98% of the assembly and contained just 18 gaps (Table 2). By contrast, the previous assemblies consisted of more than 300 scaffolds longer than 500 bp, and these contained >1300 gaps averaging >600 bp. Indeed, the contig N50s were on the order of 20 kb compared to our scaffold N50 of >360 kb (a fair comparison given the paucity of gaps in our assembly). Though the relative improvement varied by species, the N50 range (151\xe2\x80\x93445 kb) of our unordered assemblies represented significant improvements in all cases (Table 2). Excluding sub-telomeric regions, five S. bayanus chromosomes (I, VI, XI, XII, XIII) were each represented by a single large scaffold. The same was true for five S. mikatae chromosomes (II, VII, VIII, XI, XVI), and because of the paucity of gaps in this assembly the sequences were almost completely contiguous (note that in all species other than S. cerevisiae a gap persists at the rDNA locus on ChrXII). These observations, and the small number of rearrangements believed to distinguish the karyotypes of Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts (Fischer et al. 2000), prompted us to use sequence similarity to organize our initial assemblies with respect to the S. cerevisiae genome. By ordering and orienting 46\xe2\x80\x93154 scaffolds per assembly from MEGABLAST results, we were able to organize 96\xe2\x80\x9398% of bases in each species into 16 ultra-scaffolds, which were likely collinear with chromosomes (Table 2). As S. bayanus and S. mikatae have translocations relative to S. cerevisiae, we numbered all ultra-scaffolds/chromosomes according to which centromere they contained (defined largely by flanking synteny with S. cerevisiae; supporting information, Figure S1). This nomenclature differs from that proposed by Fischer et al., but is simpler and hopefully acceptable to the community. In creating ultra-scaffolds for each species, we had little difficulty observing the two known translocations in S. mikatae IFO 1815T and four translocations in S. bayanus CBS 7001 (Fischer et al. 2000). Indeed, most translocation breakpoints were spanned by large scaffolds, and were immediately visible in the scaffold alignments to the S. cerevisiae genome. As previously observed (Fischer et al. 2000), the genomes of both S. kudriavzevii strains appeared completely collinear with the S. cerevisiae genome. These observations suggested that the new assemblies were free of gross assembly errors. To test whether our proposed ultra-scaffolds had erroneously linked genomic segments, we designed PCR primers spanning 32 proposed junctions in S. bayanus. Twenty-nine of these primer sets (91%) yielded PCR products of appropriate sizes (0.5\xe2\x8",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\x934 kb), and the remainder likely failed due to the length of the intervening gap (data not shown). Despite the overall improvements in the genome assemblies, several systematic differences were evident. Notably, the unordered S. kudriavzevii and S. mikatae assemblies contained many fewer gaps than the S. bayanus assembly whereas the unordered S. kudriavzevii assemblies had considerably smaller N50 values (though still an order of magnitude greater than the original 2003 assemblies). These results were direct consequences of the mixture of read types used to assemble each strain. For instance, the greater N50 obtained for S. bayanus and S. mikatae than for S. kudriavzevii IFO 1802T was due to the availability of two long-insert libraries in the first two cases (\xe2\x88\xbc90,000 read pairs) but only one library in the latter (\xe2\x88\xbc27,000 read pairs). On the other hand, the higher number of gaps in the unordered S. bayanus assembly relative to S. mikatae and S. kudriavzevii IFO 1802T is likely due to the lower Kmer size used to assemble the Illumina reads (31 bp), and the somewhat lower Kmer coverage (45.1\xc3\x97; Table 1). [Kmer is the length of DNA that is used to construct the de Bruijn graph during assembly, and is the minimum number of identical bases required to join two overlapping reads (Zerbino and Birney 2008).] By contrast, in the case of both S. mikatae and S. kudriavzevii our raw short-read coverage of 262.1\xe2\x80\x93362.3\xc3\x97 translated to 67.0\xe2\x80\x9398.4\xc3\x97 Kmer coverage at a Kmer size of 61 bp. Given the close tracking between Kmer size and gap number, we believe that many of the remaining gaps in the S. bayanus assembly were likely to be between 31 and 61 bp in length and thus to represent minimal obstacles to routine use. Indeed, in annotating the new S. bayanus assembly it was clear that most gaps caused small interruptions in gene sequences rather than gene absences. Telomeres, transposons, and other long and highly repetitive sequences such as mammalian centromeres remain one of the main stumbling blocks to the assembly of truly complete genomes. To assemble and place any given repetitive sequence correctly, one must have library inserts of a length greater than the length of that sequence as well as unique DNA sequence on at least one side. Our Illumina libraries had mean insert sizes of 200\xe2\x80\x93440 bp, which is considerably shorter than full-length transposons in S. cerevisiae (e.g., full-length Ty1 elements are \xe2\x88\xbc6 kb long). In S. cerevisiae, sub-telomeric duplication blocks and repeats that possess few sequence differences can reach 30kb in size (Louis 1995). The combination of the high-coverage Illumina reads with the lower-coverage Sanger shotgun reads (4\xe2\x80\x935 kb insert sizes) allowed us to assemble many subtelomeric sequences, but they remained much more fragmented than the rest of the genome. Indeed, although all of our assemblies extended into the subtelomeric regions of most chromosomes, few scaffolds appeared to reach the telomeric terminal repeats. The two best examples, Skud_66 (IFO 1802T) and Skud_52 (ZP 591), were large S. kudriavzevii scaffolds (>50 kb) that corresponded along most of their lengths to S. cerevisiae ChrIV (right sub-telomere) and ChrVII (left sub-telomere), respectively. However, near the telomere end of each scaffold, the synteny with S. cerevisiae chromosomes is broken, leaving multiple apparent rearrangements with other telomeres. In general, synteny was poorly conserved in the sub-telomeric regions of all three species. The ability to assemble the telomeric regions correlated with Illumina read length, even when the Kmer length used for two of the assemblies was identical. S. kudriavzevii, with a read length of 114 bases and Kmer size of 61, had nine scaffolds with terminal-repeat sequences, including the two completely assembled telomeres described above. S. mikatae, with a read length of 80 bases and Kmer size of 61, had only one small scaffold containing terminal-repeat sequences. S. bayanus, with a read length of 51 bases and Kmer size of 31, had no terminal-repeat sequences in its genome assembly. These data suggest that read length and library insert size were both limiting factors to assembling repetitive regions with current genome assembly software. All of our raw reads are publicly available (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra; http://www.SaccharomycesSensuStricto.org), and we urge interested members of the genomics community to use them to develop methods to improve the genome assemblies of these and other problematic regions. To provide a basis for future comparative functional studies, we annotated tRNAs, repeats, centromeres, and protein-coding genes in the new genome assemblies. We anticipate the addition of more classes of functional elements in the future. For the present annotation, we took two steps to generate a robust set of protein-coding gene predictions. First, we used a yeast splice-site model as well as homology-assisted gene prediction to ensure correctly delimited genes with introns or with reading-frame interruptions. This step allowed us to correctly recover genes that have traditionally not been well annotated. For example, RPS7B (YHR021C) and BOS1 (YLR078C) both have first exons that are just 3 bp long, an intron (550 bp and 87 bp respectively) and a larger second exon. In the case of RPS7B the intron is more than twice as long as the reading frame, which is only 249 bp\xe2\x80\x94below the 100 AA (300 bp) length minimum that is a common threshold. In both cases we detected a strong match to our splice site model that allowed us to recover homologous gene structures in all five species. Similarly, we predicted homologous structures consisting of three exons and two introns for SUS1 (YBR111W-A) in all five species. To distinguish spurious open reading frames from biologically meaningful ones, we developed a database of HMMER3 protein hidden Markov models (HMMs) based on the Yeast Gene Order Browser (YGOB) (Byrne and Wolfe 2005). HMMER3 exhibits significantly increased sensitivity and specificity compared to older tools such as BLAST and combined with the gold standard human-curated YGOB database (Byrne and Wolfe 2005; Wapinski et al. 2007a) provides a powerful basis for recognizing small or fast-evolving genes and for distinguishing closely related ones. Using this approach, we could detect small genes that can easily go undetected such as the MFA1 gene (YDR461W, which encodes a 37AA-long mating pheromone a-factor protein) and the PMP2 gene (YEL017C-A, which encodes a 40AA protein). We also detected rapidly evolving genes such as SIR4 (YDR227W) (Zill et al. 2010) and YSW1 (YBR148W) (Kellis et al. 2003) with high confidence in all species. Altogether, we detected between 5440 and 5559 genes with homology to one of our YGOB-HMMs (Table 3, Table S2) and no more than 100 of the 4704 families represented by a YGOB-HMM were absent from any genome (the one exception was S. paradoxus, which had some remaining large gaps). Thus, these genes defined the core yeast proteome. We also detected several hundred genes in each genome with sequence similarity to a gene in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD, http://www.yeastgenome.org) but not to a YGOB-HMM (Table 3). In contrast to the consistent number of genes with homology to YGOB-HMMs, the recovery of genes with homology to an SGD-only gene declined rapidly with evolutionary distance from S. cerevisiae (Table 3). Although some of these are located in subtelomeres, many are annotated as dubious by SGD suggesting they are not biologically relevant (Kellis et al. 2003). The best sequence-based method to determine whether a gene is real is to test if dN/dS (\xcf\x89) is significantly different from 1; however, we were able to recover complete ortholog sets for only a small fraction of these genes (Table 3) and hence this test was not performed. Finally, we also predicted a small number of open reading frames that we could associate neither to YGOB-HMMs nor to a known SGD gene but for which we found some evidence of function (see Materials and Methods). On closer inspection, the majority of these were related either to transposable elements or derived from Y\xc2\xb4 elements, but some appeared to be species-specific genes (discussed further below). Taken together, our reannotation suggested that Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts share a large common proteome with other yeast species (Dujon et al. 2004; Souciet et al. 2009) but also possess a much smaller set of genes that distinguish them from other yeasts and from each other. To facilitate future comparative studies, we used our revised gene annotation to identify sets of genes that are orthologous across the representative strains of all five species. By making extensive use of homology and synteny (see Materials and Methods), we identified 5261 sets of orthologous proteins (82\xe2\x80\x9387% of predicted protein-coding genes; Table S1) as well as 229 tRNAs at syntenic locations, for a total of 5487 complete orthologous gene sets (Table 3). (We note that 5141 of the 5261 protein-coding orthogroups had YGOB support.) This analysis approximately doubled the number of five-species syntenic orthologs that were previously available (2742) (Cliften et al. 2003; Kellis et al. 2003), and also dramatically expanded the previous Kellis et al. dataset that identified 4180 orthologs but did not include S. kudriavzevii. The nearly complete genomes and improved annotations can be visually perused on a Gbrowse site (available at http://www.SaccharomycesSensuStricto.org). Our expanded ortholog dataset (5261 orthogroups) allowed examination of the selection pressures operating on yeast protein-coding genes on a genome-scale, painting a broad-brushstroke picture of how yeast genes evolve. This portrait should be considered conservative because of the absence of some subtelomeric genes from our ortholog set, and because of the filters we applied, which removed orthologs with problematic alignments (see Materials and Methods). We calculated the average \xcf\x89 ratio of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions (dN/dS ratio) for each of 5152 unique (1:1:1:1:1) orthologs conserved across all five species. No high-quality ortholog achieved an average \xcf\x89 value of 1, with the fastest evolving gene (YBR184W) having \xcf\x89 = 0.58 (File S1). The average across all high-quality orthologs was \xcf\x89 = 0.10, consistent with previous studies (Kellis et al. 2003), and suggesting that most yeast genes are subject to strong purifying selection. To examine yeast gene evolution on a finer scale, we considered variation in selection pressure across the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus by comparing three alternative hypotheses of the distribution of the \xcf\x89 ratio (dN/dS) along the phylogeny (Figure 2A, File S1). Specifically, for each set of unique orthologs conserved across all five species, we evaluated the hypothesis that all branches of the phylogeny exhibited the same \xcf\x89 ratio (H0) against a set of alternative hypotheses (H1) under which the \xcf\x89 ratio along the external branch for a given species was different from that in the rest of the branches of the phylogeny (H1 hypotheses; Figure 2A). To discriminate between genes that exhibited a different \xcf\x89 ratio only along a branch leading to a particular species and genes that had distinct \xcf\x89 ratios for all branches of the phylogeny, we also tested the set of H1 hypotheses against the hypothesis in which each lineage exhibited its own \xcf\x89 ratio (H2; Figure 2A). As expected, the overwhelming majority of genes did not reject the null hypothesis of a uniform \xcf\x89 ratio across the phylogeny, but 107\xe2\x80\x93251 genes in each species exhibited statistically significant lineage-specific \xcf\x89 ratios (Figure 2B). For example, our results indicated that 152 S. cerevisiae genes showed lineage-specific \xcf\x89 ratios. Of those 152 genes, 65 supported a higher \xcf\x89 ratio in the S. cerevisiae branch relative to the rest of the phylogeny, whereas 87 genes supported a lower \xcf\x89 ratio. The complete list of candidate genes that exhibit lineage-specific \xcf\x89 ratios is provided in File S1. We also examined each of the 5152 orthologs for evidence of positive selection by comparing two alternative models (called M7 and M8) of the distribution of \xcf\x89 that differ with respect to the allowance of a subset of codon sites to be under positive selection (with \xcf\x89 > 1). We found 123 genes (after filtering, see Materials and Methods) whose sequence evolution fit a model of codon evolution in which a detectable fraction of sites has been under positive selection (M8) better than it fit a model where sites evolve neutrally (M7) (File S1). Rapidly evolving genes are more likely to have functionally diverged, potentially contributing to genetic incompatibilities between species (Orr 2009). Among the 123 genes found in our analysis was SIR4, which has previously been shown to be under positive selection by multiple measures (Zill et al. 2010; Zill et al., unpublished data), supporting the view that codons within these 123 genes were evolving faster than neutral, and were not simply misaligned. Several genes involved in mitochondrial maintenance and inheritance (e.g., QRI7, and AIM2, AIM14, AIM21, AIM43) fit this pattern, consistent with suggestions that divergence in nuclear genes with mitochondrial functions have contributed to speciation in Saccharomyces (via cytonuclear incompatibility) (Chou and Leu 2010; Lee et al. 2008). Intriguingly, we also found several meiotic genes involved in homologous chromosome interactions, and/or DNA-repair-coupled chromatin modifications during meiosis, that were undergoing positive selection (e.g., ZIP2, PDS5, SRS2, DOT1, and ESC2). Saccharomyces sensu stricto species are post-zygotically isolated due to a failure of inter-species homologous chromosomes to segregate properly in meiosis I, which is caused in part by nucleotide sequence divergence acted on by the mismatch repair machinery (Greig et al. 2003; Liti et al. 2006). It is possible that these rapidly diverging chromosome-biology genes play a role in the meiotic barrier between species. To establish a quantitative framework for interspecies divergence in the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus, we used a relaxed molecular clock approach to estimate the relative divergence times among lineages (Drummond et al. 2006). However, because we were unable to consistently estimate the necessary parameters with our complete set of orthogroups (data not shown), we analyzed a smaller dataset of 106 genes spanning the yeast genome (Rokas et al. 2003). As the origin of the genus coincides with the divergence of S. bayanus from the rest of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto lineage, our results showed that the divergence of S. kudriavzevii was 78% as old as the lineage and the divergence of S. mikatae was 53% as old, whereas the divergence of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus was 33% as old as the lineage (Figure 3). Relaxed molecular clock estimation of relative species divergence within the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus. The top scale bar and the values above branches denote estimated substitutions per site. The bottom scale bar expresses species divergence in percentage points relative to the origin of the genus. The improved assemblies and consequent improved ability to detect orthologs in all five species allowed us to revisit which genes had been gained and lost in specific lineages (see Materials and Methods). Below we present the results of our initial five-genome survey as a set of hypotheses, in which each candidate genetic difference (such as a species-specific gene loss) predicts an alteration of the ancestral Saccharomyces genetic network. To organize lineage-specific gene-level changes into a simple, logical framework, we first considered any genes that were present in the common ancestor of these yeasts but were not found in all five of the modern genomes as \xe2\x80\x9closses.\xe2\x80\x9d (We note that in some cases we were able to detect pseudogenes or truncated genes but in other cases the genes had essentially vanished, consistent with either large deletion events or the accumulation of many smaller changes.) We next divided the losses into three sub-categories: \xe2\x80\x9clineage-restricted losses\xe2\x80\x9d (lost in one or two species), \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread losses\xe2\x80\x9d (absent from more than two species, but may have involved more than one loss event), and losses of one paralog of a duplicate gene pair descended from the whole-genome duplication (\xe2\x80\x9cduplicate gene losses\xe2\x80\x9d). Any genes present in one or more of the five Saccharomyces species but not in the sensu stricto ancestor we considered to be \xe2\x80\x9cgains.\xe2\x80\x9d We also analyzed tRNA variation in each of the five species. We identified at least 44 examples of genes lost from only one or two lineages (File S2). One interesting example of a gene that appeared to be completely missing was the loss from S. cerevisiae of a GATA family transcription-factor gene [Anc_2.395; we use the nomenclature proposed by YGOB to identify conserved yeast loci to also refer to the derived YGOB-HMM (Gordon et al. 2009)] related to GAT3 and GAT4. This loss suggested that a suite of target genes may have experienced regulatory changes relative to the Saccharomyces ancestral circuit. In another example, S. mikatae has lost PDC6, which encodes a minor pyruvate decarboxylase expressed under sulfur limitation. This gene has additionally been pseudogenized in S. kudriavzevii, suggesting that these species may have experienced selective pressure to alter their alcohol metabolism. In addition to identifying genes that were entirely missing, we detected many pseudogenes with varying numbers of reading-frame disruptions. A well-known example of this sort of mutation is the parallel inactivation (as pseudogenes) of all the GAL genes in S. kudriavzevii IFO 1802T but not ZP 591 (Hittinger et al. 2004; Hittinger et al. 2010). Our analysis recovered all of these and a previously described mutation in the S. bayanus CBS 7001 BAR1 gene (Zill and Rine 2008), where a single base-pair deletion leads to a frameshift and truncated coding sequence. We found several additional likely pseudogenes in each of the five species (File S2). Notable among these were several metabolic genes such as GTO1, which encodes an omega-class glutathione transferase, lost in S. bayanus and S. mikatae. Similarly, S. mikatae lost the genes OYE3, which encodes an NADPH oxidoreductase, and GND2, which encodes the minor isoform of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Additionally, a few losses involve genes important for stress responses or environmental interactions such as S. bayanus CAD1, which encodes an AP-1-like basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor involved in stress responses and iron metabolism. Many differences among species that initially appeared to be lineage-specific gains were in fact losses of ancestral genes in multiple lineages. For example, it was clear from the presence of a syntenic homolog in Naumovozyma castellii (syn. Saccharomyces castellii) and other yeast species that the budding-yeast Dicer homolog in S. bayanus (Anc_8.880) (Drinnenberg et al. 2009) has been lost in the other sensu stricto species, and not gained on the S. bayanus lineage. The same conclusion applied to several genes with sequence similarity to a YGOB-HMM but for which we had no functional data (Table 4). The rapidly evolving gene Sbay_15.267 also fell into this category; orthologs were found in Candida glabrata (Nakaseomyces clade) N. castellii, and S. bayanus but not other sequenced species. The average dN/dS value was estimated as 0.33, but only about half of the codons could be aligned in all three species, indicating that despite the conservation of an intact open reading frame it was likely one of the fastest-evolving genes in yeast (Zill et al. 2010). We also detected the multiple paralogs of SIR1 in S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus, which function in transcriptional silencing in these species (Gallagher et al. 2009). As a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event occurred in the ancestry of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts, we paid special attention to detecting duplicate pairs originating from this event. In total, our automated procedure detected 1044\xe2\x80\x931084 WGD duplicate genes (522\xe2\x80\x93542 pairs) in each species (see Materials and Methods). 98% of those predicted in S. cerevisiae agreed with those listed in the Yeast Gene Order Browser (Byrne and Wolfe 2005). From these data, it was apparent that many of the potential gains and losses we detected were actually the result of differential loss of ancestrally duplicated genes from the yeast whole-genome duplication (Table 5), a process that contributes to reproductive isolation (Lynch and Conery 2000; Scannell et al. 2006). For example, it was clear from the syntenic context that the presence of two copies of GAL80 in S. bayanus was not due to a recent duplication but to loss of one of the two ancestral copies derived from the WGD on the shared S. cerevisiae/S. kudriavzevii lineage and its retention on the S. bayanus lineage (Hittinger et al. 2004; Cliften et al. 2006). Indeed, both GAL80 WGD duplicates were also retained in other yeasts such as N. castellii. Interestingly, not all of the cases in Table 5 can be explained by a single loss event. For example, the gene YML020W was present in two copies in S. paradoxus, indicating that it was present in duplicate until relatively recently. Therefore, one copy has become a pseudogene independently in each of the other Saccharomyces sensu stricto lineages. The same logic applied for SSU1. These observations were in line with previous predictions (Scannell et al. 2007b). Although gene gains are quite rare in hemiascomycetes (Hall and Dietrich 2007; Gordon et al. 2009), we found three candidates for horizontal gene transfer events. For example, Smik_18.9 is 849 bp long and has codon usage typical of other S. mikatae genes but has no detectable homology to any gene in SGD. On closer inspection, it shows weak sequence similarity to the YGOB-HMM Anc_8.241 (homologous to CRG1/YHR209W and TMT1/YER175C) and is clearly related to the Lachancea thermotolerans gene, KLTH0F00110. Both KLTH0F00110 and CRG1 are annotated as S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases, indicating that Smik_18.9 is a real gene that likely contributes to species-specific biology. Of the two other possible horizontal gene transfers in S. mikatae, one, CGSSp3BS71_00010 (an uncharacterized protein from Streptococcus pneumoniae), was apparently also present in S. paradoxus. These bacterial sequences were not merely contaminants introduced during Illumina library preparation, as we found identical sequences using BLAST in the Sanger shotgun reads. However, as there was only a single hit in NCBI, we could not construct gene trees to test whether it was a true horizontal transfer. Similarly, the S. mikatae gene Smik_10.15 was a candidate horizontal gene transfer, because it displayed strong sequence similarity to a gene with an NTF2 domain from the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum (E-value of 6E-18), but no fungal homolog was detected. However, because Smik_10.15 could not be placed within a specific bacterial clade (data not shown), we have not yet confirmed this as a horizontal transfer event. Interestingly, our analysis led to the discovery of a novel S. cerevisiae gene homologous to Anc_7.495. This gene is conserved across all Saccharomyces sensu stricto (as well as more diverged) yeasts but was previously not observed, presumably due to its short length (237 bp; Table 4). A dN/dS ratio of 0.29 confirms that this gene is subject to codon-level evolutionary constraint within the Saccharomyces sensu stricto and, based on the established naming convention, we propose that it be named YJR107C-A. Using tRNA-ScanSE, we identified all 275 SGD-annotated tRNA genes in the S. cerevisiae genome with no false positives. Given the reliability of this procedure, we were surprised to observe that the number of Ser:AGA tRNA genes varied from 8 in S. kudriavzevii to 14 in S. bayanus (Table S3). Based on synteny, we estimate that there were 9\xe2\x80\x9310 copies in the ancestor of all the species presented here and that whereas S. kudriavzevii has sustained a net loss of Ser:AGA tRNA genes, S. bayanus and S. paradoxus have gained copies. Variation in Ser:AGA tRNA copy number was not compensated by variation in the copy number of other serine tRNA genes (Table S3). Functional tests of the genetic rewiring and other hypotheses presented above would require genetically tractable and marked strains from across the Saccharomyces genus. The four strains whose genomes we sequenced (IFO 1815T and derivatives of IFO 1802T, ZP 591, and CBS 7001) were originally prototrophic and homothallic. To enable genetic experiments to be conducted with similar ease to experiments in S. cerevisiae, the HO gene was inactivated and auxotrophic markers were introduced into the reference or type strains for S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus. The ura3\xe2\x88\x860 strains are of particular utility because they enable the two-step procedure necessary to introduce precise changes in individual nucleotides (Storici et al. 2001). Although some of these strains have been described previously (Hittinger et al. 2010; Zill et al. 2010; Gallagher et al. 2009), for the community\xe2\x80\x99s benefit, we briefly summarize below how each set of strains was generated (see Materials and Methods). A convenient collection of the most useful strains can be obtained from a single central repository (Table 6). Some heterothallic, marked S. paradoxus strains are already available (Cubillos et al. 2009). Collectively, laboratory-ready strains are now available for genetic experiments in every Saccharomyces species whose genome sequence has been published. Nonmodel species can often pose unanticipated challenges when brought into the laboratory. However, they also offer the great benefit of phenotypic diversity. To highlight some potentially useful characteristics of these newly laboratory-adapted yeast species described above and to alert investigators to potential practical problems, we offer several anecdotal observations culled from our collective experiences working with these nonmodel yeasts. We note that these comparisons are made to standard S. cerevisiae laboratory strains such as S288C. Hence some of the trait differences described below almost certainly resulted from the selections imposed on S. cerevisiae strains during laboratory adaptation, as others have noted (Liu et al. 1996; Gaisne et al. 1999). As with most wild strains, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus diploids showed very high levels of sporulation (approaching 100%) when placed on standard potassium acetate medium. These Saccharomyces sensu stricto strains also sporulated with striking efficiency (25\xe2\x80\x9350%) after about 1 week on YPD plates stored at room temperature. These strains also sporulated on YPD at 4\xc2\xb0C over a somewhat longer period of time. The tetrads of each of these species were of a greater size range than those of S. cerevisiae, but were smaller on average. As previously noted, these species preferred to grow at 18\xe2\x80\x9323\xc2\xb0C, and did not grow well at 30\xc2\xb0C (Sampaio and Goncalves 2008). Indeed, they appeared more sensitive to heat shock than S. cerevisiae, but tolerated cold and freeze-thaw cycles better than S. cerevisiae (Kvitek et al. 2008). In liquid culture, flocculence was readily apparent in S. paradoxus and one of the S. kudriavzevii strains (IFO 1802T and derivatives). In fact, IFO 1802T was so flocculent that in overnight liquid culture it grew into spherical, 2-3mm pellets. Flocculence was less pronounced in S. mikatae, S. bayanus, and S. kudriavzevii strain ZP 591, with haploids of these strains more closely resembling the mild clumpiness of S. cerevisiae vineyard strain RM11 (R. Brem, personal communication). Interestingly, flocculence in S. paradoxus and S. kudriavzevii IFO 1802T appeared to be regulated by mating type. In both species, MATa/\xce\xb1 diploids were less flocculent than both MATa and MAT\xce\xb1 haploids. This regulation was likely due to mating-type control, rather than diploidy per se, as haploid sir\xce\x94 mutants (which express HML\xce\xb1 and HMRa) of both species showed reduced flocculence (O. Zill, unpublished data). Cells of all four species displayed obvious differences in size and shape between haploids (small and round, often growing in clusters) and diploids (larger and ovoid, with polar budding). Diploids often appeared bulb-shaped, with a rounded apical tip and a flat base defined by the cell\xe2\x80\x99s site of budding from its mother. All four species propagated S. cerevisiae CEN/ARS and 2\xce\xbc plasmids well enough to conduct complementation experiments (Gallagher et al. 2009). However, in S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus CEN/ARS vectors segregated with lower fidelity than in S. cerevisiae, which was likely due to divergence in the CEN element (Figure S1; C. T. Hittinger and J. Gallagher, unpublished data). Notably, Japanese S. kudriavzevii (IFO 1802T) lack functional galactose metabolic and regulatory genes, while Portuguese S. kudriavzevii (ZP 591) are Gal+ (Hittinger et al. 2010). Thus, the standard GAL induction plasmids would only work in the Portuguese strains, in which there was still a delayed response to galactose (Hittinger et al. 2010). S. kudriavzevii was originally reported to utilize the fructose-based complex carbohydrate inulin (Naumov et al. 2000). However, others and we were unable to replicate this result (C. T. Hittinger and Gregory I. Lang (Princeton University), unpublished data). A vibrant community of geneticists, genomicists, and computational biologists has made S. cerevisiae into a model species whose genome is arguably the best described, most easily manipulated, and best understood at all functional levels. Here we have provided a set of genetically tractable laboratory strains and vastly improved genome sequences that make Saccharomyces sensu stricto a model genus for evolutionary and comparative analyses and experiments. Deep paired-end Illumina sequencing allowed us to determine nearly complete genome sequences of S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus, and to assign over 96% of base pairs to specific chromosomal locations. The closure of most gaps and the creation of ultra-scaffolds allowed us to provide a user-friendly genome browser (available through http://www.SaccharomycesSensuStricto.org) for each species that will facilitate rapid experimental design, visualization of data, and further analyses. The ultra-scaffolds should be of particular value to genetic mapping studies. Draft genome sequences of S. arboricolus and S. bayanus var. bayanus (G. Liti, E. Louis, and C. Nieduszynski, personal communication; Libkind, Hittinger et al., unpublished data) are also available, completing the catalog of known species-level diversity for the Saccharomyces genus (Figure 1A). Among model organisms, the genome of S. cerevisiae is uniquely well described both in terms of its functional elements and the relationships among those elements. The new assemblies and genetic tools presented here permit the same level of knowledge to be attained in its con-generic species. However, they also open the door to understanding how functions and interactions change over time by studying the same (orthologous) genes in multiple species. Such an evolutionary approach is becoming ever more common and has proven powerful even when applied to pathways with a long history of study in S. cerevisiae (Hittinger et al. 2010; Zill et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2008). To facilitate such studies, we have annotated 5261 sets of genes that are orthologous among all five species (Table 3, Table S1). Thus, the vast majority of Saccharomyces sensu stricto genes are now available for systematic comparative and evolutionary study. The annotation of nearly complete genomes for five Saccharomyces species approximately doubled the number of orthologous gene sets available when compared with the sequences available in 2003 (previously 2742 orthogroups). This comparison provides an important reminder of the relationship between assembly completeness, annotation accuracy, and the downstream comparative analyses that rely on complete datasets (e.g., phylogenetics). For example, even if 95% of genes were present and correctly annotated in each assembly, we would only expect 77% (0.955) of genes to be present and correctly assigned to sets of orthologous genes in all species (assuming assembly biases are uncorrelated). Indeed, with five species, genome annotations that were 80% complete and accurate would yield full ortholog sets for just 33% of genes. To obtain orthogroups for 90% of genes would require an average per-genome completeness and accuracy of 98%. Thus, relative to single-genome studies, comparative studies are disproportionately sensitive to missing data and to the quality of the underlying annotations. Because this problem scales exponentially with the number of species, it will become drastically more severe as more species are considered. Therefore, designing procedures and analyses that are robust to missing data must be a key component and priority of future large-scale comparative genome sequencing projects. Although we identified orthologs across all five species for most genes, we came across many examples of genes that had been lost in one or more lineages. For example, the losses of PDC6 on the S. mikatae lineage and CAD1 on the S. bayanus lineage immediately suggest potential species-specific biology. Interestingly, many of these losses appeared to involve members of duplicate pairs derived from the yeast whole-genome duplication (Wolfe and Shields 1997). The period after the WGD was characterized by rapid protein evolution (Kellis et al. 2004; Scannell and Wolfe 2008) and gene loss (Scannell et al. 2006), but our data suggest that duplicate genes continue to experience an elevated rate of loss even 100 million years after the WGD event. Though initially surprising, this conclusion is in line with previous analyses predicting that a small fraction of redundant duplicates remained to be resolved (Scannell et al. 2007b). Further, our observations of multiple orthologous losses (e.g., Anc_5.554, Table 5) are consistent with the proposal that if one copy is capable of supplying all the required functions, then the second (\xe2\x80\x9cminor\xe2\x80\x9d) copy will be convergently lost in all lineages (Scannell and Wolfe 2008). This idea is also supported by the loss of URA10 rather than URA5 from S. mikatae. URA5 and URA10 encode phosphoribosyltransferase genes that catalyze the fifth step in the pathway of de novo synthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, but in S. cerevisiae URA10 supplies less than 20% of the activity and is conditionally expressed. Taken together, these observations point to the fascinating conclusion that the consequences of the WGD are still felt by modern yeast and contribute significantly to genomic and potentially phenotypic differences among S. cerevisiae and its con-generic species. Moreover, a specific line of research that emerges from this observation is to compare the biological functions of WGD duplicates that differ in copy number among these five yeasts using the strains that we have generated. In addition to lineage-specific losses, we also identified a number of candidates for lineage-specific gains, including two possible horizontal gene transfers from bacteria. These genes differentiate the Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts from one another (Table 4) and thus may play important roles in ecological specialization. Interestingly, among the putative gene gains we identified, was the discovery of a novel gene in S. cerevisiae that resides between YJR107W and YJR108W (Table 4). The biological functions of this rapidly evolving gene are unknown but its deep conservation outside the Saccharomyces sensu stricto clade leaves little doubt that it has a function. The discovery of a novel gene in the well-studied S. cerevisiae genome validated our goal of producing high-quality annotations for five sensu stricto yeasts. Along with creating stably marked haploid strains, we have ported routine techniques for manipulating S. cerevisiae genetically to the other Saccharomyces species. These include the powerful tools of targeted-gene knockouts, plasmid-driven expression, and altering single nucleotides within genomes. Species within the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus also readily hybridize (Masneuf et al. 1998; Greig 2009; Martin et al. 2009). The complementary markers and mating types in the collection make these experiments especially convenient. Interspecies hybrids can be used in complementation tests to identify mutated genes in species closely related to a model organism (Zill et al., in preparation), and to study the evolution of genetic regulatory circuits (Bullard et al. 2010; Gasch et al. 2004; Guan et al. 2007; Tirosh et al. 2009). This expansion of genetically tractable species opens the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genus to comparative analysis, and provides molecular biologists with an unrivaled set of tools to explore this model genus. With near-complete genome sequences, geneticists now have essentially complete experimental access to the genomes of each species. The candidate changes in gene content and selection pressures we found within each Saccharomyces sensu stricto species present excellent opportunities to study species-specific biology, and to use these genetic differences to learn how genetic networks have been rewired during the evolution of this genus. At the same time, the large set of orthologs we have identified provides a strong foundation for comparative genetic studies, and should lead to a wealth of discoveries that are refractory to sequence-based analyses. Together, these new genomic resources and universal genetic techniques provide an infrastructure for an unprecedented integration of evolutionary and experimental biology, enabled by the Saccharomyces model genus and the awesome power of yeast genetics.

In this study, cDNA\xe2\x80\x93single strand conformation polymorphism analysis was applied to measure the expression of 30 homeologous transcripts in naturally occurring haploid (ABD, 2n = 21) and its polyploid maternal parent Yumai 21A (AABBDD, 2n = 42) in wheat. Only one gene (TC251989) showed preferentially silenced homoeoalleles in haploids. Further analyses of 24 single-copy genes known to be silenced in the root and/or leaf also found no evidence of homeologous silencing in 1-month-old haploids and two ESTs (BF484100 and BF473379) exhibit different expression patterns between 4-month-old haploids and hexaploids. Global analysis of the gene expression patterns using the Affymetrix GeneChip showed that of the 55,052 genes probed, only about 0.11% in the shoots and 0.25% in the roots were activated by polyhaploidization. The results demonstrate that activation and silencing of homoeoalleles were not widespread in haploid seedlings.Polyploidy is a recurring process in the evolution of flowering plants that has had a considerable impact on plant species diversity (reviewed in Wendel and Doyle 2005). Estimates for the incidence of polyploidy in angiosperms vary from 30 to 80%, and 2\xe2\x80\x934% of speciation events can be attributed to genome duplications (Otto and Whitton 2000). According to the genome difference, polyploid can be classified as autopolyploidy (the doubling of a single genome) and allopolyploidy (the merger of two fully differentiated genomes) (Tate et al. 2004). Most of our important crop plants have evolved as a result of one or more wide hybridization events, each followed by a chromosome doubling step to restore fertility\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93the end product of these processes being a stable allopolyploid (Bottley et al. 2006). In recent years, the consequences of polyploidy for the evolution of genes and genomes and for gene expression have been investigated extensively in plants (Song et al. 1995; Levy and Feldman 2004; Pires et al. 2004; Pontes et al. 2004; Udall et al. 2006; Wendel et al. 1995; Small et al. 1999). One direct and observable consequence of polyploidy is that homeologous genes are expressed at different levels and respond differently to allopolyploidy in various organs of the plants (reviewed in Adams 2007). Thus, a particular homoeoallele may be silenced in leaf tissue but expressed in the root, while another gene may have the opposite pattern of expression. Homeologous gene silencing in newly synthesized polyploids occurs at a frequency of approximately 5% in cotton and wheat (Adams et al. 2004; Kashkush et al. 2002) and at 0.5% in synthetic Arabidopsis alloploids (Comai et al. 2000). In contrast, in established polyploids, such as cotton, the proportion of genes with only partial homoeoalleles expressed is as high as 25% (Adams et al. 2003), while in hexaploid bread wheat, silencing occurs at a frequency of approximately 29% for the unigene loci, and typically only one of the three homoeoalleles present is silenced (Bottley et al. 2006). Homeologous gene expression patterns can vary by generation in neopolyploids (Wang et al. 2004), suggesting a sorting out process of expression regulation immediately after allopolyploidy that lasts for a few generations. The reactivation of silenced homoeoalleles, which has been observed in synthetic alloploids (Kashkush et al. 2002), in distinct plant organs of cotton (Adams et al. 2003), and among derived aneuploids of bread wheat (Bottley et al. 2006), indicates that homoeoalleles silencing is mainly achieved by epigenetic rather than genetic means. Most studies on polyploidization have been focused on establishing the frequencies or patterns of homeologous gene expression in the context of polyploidization (Tate et al. 2004; Wendel and Doyle 2005; Adams 2007). Moreover, most of them employed the synthesized haploids and polyploids, while the natural polyploids were seldom used (Peng et al. 2008), except some recent polyploids such as Spartina (Baumel et al. 2001), Tragopogon (Cook and Soltis 1999) and Senecio (Abbott and Lowe 2004; Hegarty et al. 2006). As we know, both inducing treatment and tissue culture conditions have the potential to modify the DNA structure, influence gene expression, and eventually interference the accuracy of study on ploidy effects. For example, tissue culture can activate retrotransposon Tos17, and change the methylation status of its flank regions (Han et al. 2004), DNA sequence and gene expression (Cheng et al. 2006). Furthermore, to date the associations between homeologous gene expression changes and polyhaploidization had rarely been addressed, which might result in the inaccuracy for understanding ploidy effect in gene expression. Yumai 21 is a male sterile line with the Aegilops kotschyi cytoplasm in wheat. Ae. kotschyi cytoplasm naturally induces the haploids form, which is free of inducing treatment or tissue culture, even in combinations between male-sterile wheat and a restoring line, the frequency of haploids is as high as 80% (Kobayashi 1980). Cytological observations and epigenetic studies provide evidence that the haploid originates from the female parent (Sun et al. 1994). Thus, this provides excellent material for elucidating the influence of polyhaploidization on homeologous gene expression patterns. Homeologous sequences are, by definition, highly similar but nonidentical, and resolving individual homoeoallelic transcripts from one another has been technically difficult (Bottley et al. 2006). Pervious researchers have shown that the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique is capable of distinguishing homeologous wheat gDNA sequences (Forsstr\xc3\xb6m et al. 2003; Bottley et al. 2006). In the present study, we investigated the patterns of homeologous gene expression between the haploid and hexaploid wheats using the SSCP technique. Furthermore, the Affymetrix GeneChip was also exploited to survey the silencing and activation of genes after polyhaploidization. Our objective is to establish the extent to which patterns of homeologous silencing vary between haploids and its corresponding hexaploids.'","b""Interspecific hybridization has a much greater effect than chromosome doubling on gene expression; however, the associations between homeologous gene expression changes and polyhaploidization had rarely been addressed. In this study, cDNA\xe2\x80\x93single strand conformation polymorphism analysis was applied to measure the expression of 30 homeologous transcripts in naturally occurring haploid (ABD, 2n = 21) and its polyploid maternal parent Yumai 21A (AABBDD, 2n = 42) in wheat. Only one gene (TC251989) showed preferentially silenced homoeoalleles in haploids. Further analyses of 24 single-copy genes known to be silenced in the root and/or leaf also found no evidence of homeologous silencing in 1-month-old haploids and two ESTs (BF484100 and BF473379) exhibit different expression patterns between 4-month-old haploids and hexaploids. Global analysis of the gene expression patterns using the Affymetrix GeneChip showed that of the 55,052 genes probed, only about 0.11% in the shoots and 0.25% in the roots were activated by polyhaploidization. The results demonstrate that activation and silencing of homoeoalleles were not widespread in haploid seedlings. Polyploidy is a recurring process in the evolution of flowering plants that has had a considerable impact on plant species diversity (reviewed in Wendel and Doyle 2005). Estimates for the incidence of polyploidy in angiosperms vary from 30 to 80%, and 2\xe2\x80\x934% of speciation events can be attributed to genome duplications (Otto and Whitton 2000). According to the genome difference, polyploid can be classified as autopolyploidy (the doubling of a single genome) and allopolyploidy (the merger of two fully differentiated genomes) (Tate et al. 2004). Most of our important crop plants have evolved as a result of one or more wide hybridization events, each followed by a chromosome doubling step to restore fertility\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93the end product of these processes being a stable allopolyploid (Bottley et al. 2006). In recent years, the consequences of polyploidy for the evolution of genes and genomes and for gene expression have been investigated extensively in plants (Song et al. 1995; Levy and Feldman 2004; Pires et al. 2004; Pontes et al. 2004; Udall et al. 2006; Wendel et al. 1995; Small et al. 1999). One direct and observable consequence of polyploidy is that homeologous genes are expressed at different levels and respond differently to allopolyploidy in various organs of the plants (reviewed in Adams 2007). Thus, a particular homoeoallele may be silenced in leaf tissue but expressed in the root, while another gene may have the opposite pattern of expression. Homeologous gene silencing in newly synthesized polyploids occurs at a frequency of approximately 5% in cotton and wheat (Adams et al. 2004; Kashkush et al. 2002) and at 0.5% in synthetic Arabidopsis alloploids (Comai et al. 2000). In contrast, in established polyploids, such as cotton, the proportion of genes with only partial homoeoalleles expressed is as high as 25% (Adams et al. 2003), while in hexaploid bread wheat, silencing occurs at a frequency of approximately 29% for the unigene loci, and typically only one of the three homoeoalleles present is silenced (Bottley et al. 2006). Homeologous gene expression patterns can vary by generation in neopolyploids (Wang et al. 2004), suggesting a sorting out process of expression regulation immediately after allopolyploidy that lasts for a few generations. The reactivation of silenced homoeoalleles, which has been observed in synthetic alloploids (Kashkush et al. 2002), in distinct plant organs of cotton (Adams et al. 2003), and among derived aneuploids of bread wheat (Bottley et al. 2006), indicates that homoeoalleles silencing is mainly achieved by epigenetic rather than genetic means. Most studies on polyploidization have been focused on establishing the frequencies or patterns of homeologous gene expression in the context of polyploidization (Tate et al. 2004; Wendel and Doyle 2005; Adams 2007). Moreover, most of them employed the synthesized haploids and polyploids, while the natural polyploids were seldom used (Peng et al. 2008), except some recent polyploids such as Spartina (Baumel et al. 2001), Tragopogon (Cook and Soltis 1999) and Senecio (Abbott and Lowe 2004; Hegarty et al. 2006). As we know, both inducing treatment and tissue culture conditions have the potential to modify the DNA structure, influence gene expression, and eventually interference the accuracy of study on ploidy effects. For example, tissue culture can activate retrotransposon Tos17, and change the methylation status of its flank regions (Han et al. 2004), DNA sequence and gene expression (Cheng et al. 2006). Furthermore, to date the associations between homeologous gene expression changes and polyhaploidization had rarely been addressed, which might result in the inaccuracy for understanding ploidy effect in gene expression. Yumai 21 is a male sterile line with the Aegilops kotschyi cytoplasm in wheat. Ae. kotschyi cytoplasm naturally induces the haploids form, which is free of inducing treatment or tissue culture, even in combinations between male-sterile wheat and a restoring line, the frequency of haploids is as high as 80% (Kobayashi 1980). Cytological observations and epigenetic studies provide evidence that the haploid originates from the female parent (Sun et al. 1994). Thus, this provides excellent material for elucidating the influence of polyhaploidization on homeologous gene expression patterns. Homeologous sequences are, by definition, highly similar but nonidentical, and resolving individual homoeoallelic transcripts from one another has been technically difficult (Bottley et al. 2006). Pervious researchers have shown that the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique is capable of distinguishing homeologous wheat gDNA sequences (Forsstr\xc3\xb6m et al. 2003; Bottley et al. 2006). In the present study, we investigated the patterns of homeologous gene expression between the haploid and hexaploid wheats using the SSCP technique. Furthermore, the Affymetrix GeneChip was also exploited to survey the silencing and activation of genes after polyhaploidization. Our objective is to establish the extent to which patterns of homeologous silencing vary between haploids and its corresponding hexaploids. The haploid wheat (2n = 3x = 21 ABD, hereafter referred to as Yumai 21H) was obtained from a cross between the male-sterile wheat line Yumai 21 (2n = 6x = 42 AABBDD, hereafter referred to as Yumai 21A) with the Aegilops kotschyi Boiss cytoplasm and the maintainer line Yumai 21 (2n = 6x = 42 AABBDD, hereafter referred to as Yumai 21B) developed by Dr. Kehui Zhan (Henan Agricultural University, China). Seedlings were germinated on wet filter paper at 25\xc2\xb0C, thereafter vernalized in the dark at 5\xc2\xb0C for 18 d, and transplanted to soil (pots of \xc3\x98 17 cm) after vernalization. Plants were grown in a greenhouse at 24/18\xc2\xb0C (day/night) with a 16-h photoperiod for 1 or 4 months. T. turgidum (AABB) and Ae. tauschii (DD) were used as controls of homeoallelic origin in the cDNA\xe2\x80\x93SSCP experiments. Shoot and/or root tissues from 1- or 4-month-old plants were harvested into liquid nitrogen prior to the extraction of total RNA and genomic DNA (gDNA). Total RNA were extracted using the TRIZOL reagent (Sigma Chemical Co.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and crude RNA preparations were treated with DNase (Invitrogen), following a phenol/chloroform extraction (Sambrook and Russell 2001). cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II (Invitrogen), using oligo (dT) as the polyA primer and following the manufacturer's protocol. To detect the contaminating gDNA, newly synthesized cDNA was amplified with intron-spanning PCR primers (ActinF 5\xe2\x80\xb2-CTGCTTTGAGATCCACAT-3\xe2\x80\xb2, ActinR 5\xe2\x80\xb2-GTCACCACTTTCAACTCC-3\xe2\x80\xb2), which could distinguish the contaminating gDNA from the RNA-derived DNA. The entire experiment was performed with three independent biological replicates, and each biological sample was generated by pooling three individual plants together. To determine the ploidy and confirm the haploid form, flow cytometry for nuclear content was conducted. Leaves or petals of each plant were subjected to flow cytometry following the method by Pfosser et al. (1995) and analyzed with a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). To investigate the regulation of homeologous gene expression between the haploid and hexaploid wheat, two sets of expressed sequence tags were exploited. First, 30 low-copy ESTs were selected from the previous study of Pumphrey et al. (2009) on the basis that they had been verified by Southern blot hybridization to have the same number of deletion bins (e.g. having three bands, with one band from each homeologous locus in a group of chromosomes). An additional 24 ESTs that mapped exclusively to a set of homeologous genes located on one of the wheat chromosome groups 1, 2, 3, or 7 were arbitrarily selected from those examined by Bottley et al. (2006) on the basis that they had clearly defined SSCP profiles and exhibited silencing in either the Florida or Chinese Spring cultivars. RT-PCR was carried out in a volume of 10 \xce\xbcl, which comprised 1 \xce\xbcl cDNA template (1:20 dilution of the cDNA), 5 \xce\xbcl Hotstar Master Mix (Qiagen), 0.25 \xce\xbcl of each primer (10 mm concentration), and 3.5 \xce\xbcl distilled water. The PCR program consisted of a predenaturation step of 15 min at 95\xc2\xb0C, followed by 35 cycles of 95\xc2\xb0C for 30 sec, 59\xc2\xb0C for 30 sec, and 72\xc2\xb0C for 60 sec, and a final extension step of 72\xc2\xb0C for 10 min. Amplicons were electrophoretically separated by SSCP and visualized by silver staining (Bottley et al. 2006). The SSCP profiles generated from the gDNA were compared with those derived from the equivalent cDNA template. If all the homeologous copies identified for the gDNA template were also present in the cDNA profile, full expression was assumed for the homeologous sequences. For cases in which, despite the known presence of a gDNA locus, no matching cDNA was detected, the relevant locus was scored as \xe2\x80\x9csilenced.\xe2\x80\x9d For all the homoeoloci, duplicate assays were carried out to confirm the data. One-month-old plants were used to evaluate the differences in gene expression patterns between haploids and its parent, Yumai 21A, with Affymetrix GeneChip hybridization. Shoot and /or root tissues of each plant were sampled and frozen immediately, and sent to Genetimes Technology Inc. (Shanghai, China) for cDNA synthesis. Labeled target used in hybridizations was generated from 0.5 \xce\xbcg of total RNA using the One-Cycle Eukaryotic Target Labeling Assay. Hybridizations, washing, staining and scanning were performed as specified in the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s protocol (http://www.affymetrix.com). The hybridization was performed with three independent biological replicates, and each biological sample was a pool of three plants. Fluorescence intensity data were recorded using GenePix Pro v6.0 (Molecular Devices) (supporting information, Table S1). Lower-quality and weakly hybridizing features were stringently flagged for exclusion (by requiring a circularity ratio \xe2\x89\xa50.8, signal intensity >75% of background plus one standard deviation, and the sum of median intensity from each channel >900) to initially reduce printing and hybridization errors. Data normalization was performed according to Bolstad's quantile procedure for oligonucleotide arrays (Bolstad et al. 2003). Therefore, control and empty spots were filtered out before normalization. Statistical analysis was performed with GeneSpring 7.3 (Agilent Technologies) using methods adapted from Casu et al. (2007). Present (P) and absent (A) calls for Affymetrix probe sets are generated based on statistical analysis of hybridization signal of oligonucleotides from one probe set where present (P < 0.04) and absent (P > 0.06). Although the number of chromosomes in the haploid wheat was half of that in the hexaploids, they exhibited similar morphologies in the seedling stage (Figure 1); therefore, it is difficult to distinguish haploids from hexaploids in wheat. Therefore, we applied flow cytometry to screen haploids. Examination using the leaves of confirmed haploid and hexaploid wheat plants showed that the fluorescence peak of hexaploid nuclei located at channel position 400, whereas that of haploid nuclei located at channel position 200 (Figure 1A), consistent with the expected DNA relationship of the two types of plants. Among the 282 individuals analyzed by flow cytometry, 27 samples had nuclei with a fluorescence peak at channel position 200 (not accounting for twin seedlings), which were considered as haploids, and were confirmed by our observations of cytology and morphology (Figure S1). Flow cytometric analysis of different ploidy levels in wheat. (A) Hexaploid. (B) Haploids. The expression patterns of individual genome homoeoalleles were assessed by cDNA\xe2\x80\x93SSCP with seedlings of Yumai 21A and Yumai 21H. A set of 30 well-characterized transcripts (Pumphrey et al. 2009) was first used for comparison and validation. These transcripts had clearly defined SSCP profiles. Unexpectedly, of the thirty low-copy ESTs, 29 have similar electrophoretograms between the haploid and the hexaploid forms in both the root and shoot tissues, revealing that neither activation nor silencing of the genome homoeoalleles was detected following polyhaploidization (Figure 2). Only one EST (TC251989) showed altered expression pattern between the haploids and the hexaploids. The A or B and D genome homoeoalleles of TC251989p (p indicated primers that were selected from Pumphrey et al. 2009. ESTs without this tag were selected from Bottley et al. 2006) were expressed in both the shoot and root tissues of the hexaploids, and expressed in root but not in shoot of haploids (Figure 2). These results revealed that all the homoeoalleles of TC251989p were silenced in the shoot tissues after polyhaploidization. Organ-specific transcripts silencing of four ESTs identified from the cDNA\xe2\x80\x93SSCP analysis of 30 expressed sequence tags in seedlings. Equal amounts of second-strand cDNA from a hexaploid (AABBDD) and a naturally produced polyhaploids (ABD) were PCR-amplified with conserved primers for each locus, and electrophoresed on MDE polyacrylamide gels. The arrows indicate the bands from different genome. Organ-specific expression was detected in the hexaploids and haploids. Three of the 30 arbitrarily selected sets of homeologous transcripts (10%) displayed organ-specific expression patterns in the hexaploid seedlings. As shown in Figure 2, the D genome homoeoallele of BF482744p was not expressed in the shoot tissue of the hexaploids, whereas the A, B and D genome homoeoallele of TC273472p were absent in shoot tissue. To the contrary, the D genome homoeoallele of BF145701p was lacking in the root tissue of the hexaploid seedlings. A similar expression pattern was observed for haploids (Figure 2). To increase the number of genes surveyed, we assayed an additional 24 ESTs of which at least one homoeoallele is known to be silenced in the variety of Chinese Spring (Bottley et al. 2006). Direct comparisons were possible between gDNA profiles and their corresponding cDNA-derived profiles because the amplicons represent intron-free sequences. There were no significant changes in the numbers of genome homoeoalleles between the 1-month-old haploid and hexaploid seedlings. For example, the B genome homoeoallele of BF499478 (only one copy was identified in Chinese Spring) was detected in all tissues of hexaploid seedlings. Similar expression pattern of this homoeoallele was also present in all tissues of haploid seedlings (Figure S2). Furthermore, to understand the homeologous gene expression in different developmental stage, the expression patterns of 24 ESTs in 4-month-old haploids and hexaploids were investigated. Comparison of the cDNA and gDNA profiles revealed that the D genome homoeoallele of BF473379 was not in the root tissue of hexaploids but present in haploids, and was therefore activated in the shoot sample (Figure 3). The A or B genome homoeoallele of BF484100, which was apparently not expressed in either the shoot or root tissues of hexaploids, became active in both tissues of haploids. An unexpected observation was that the D genome homoeoallele of BF484100 was present in shoots but not detected roots of haploids. These varied expression patterns suggest that there was a bias toward selective and transcriptional inactivation of some homoeoalleles. Images of the specifically expressed EST transcripts, as identified by cDNA\xe2\x80\x93SSCP analysis of 24 arbitrary selected expressed sequence tags. Equal amounts of second-strand cDNA from a hexaploid (AABBDD) and a naturally produced polyhaploids (ABD) were PCR-amplified with conserved primers for each locus, and electrophoresed on MDE polyacrylamide gels. The arrows indicate the bands from different genome. Developmentally regulated gene silencing occurs both in haploids and hexaploids. Of the 24 arbitrarily selected sets of ESTs, four in haploids and five in hexaploids showed developmentally regulated silencing (Figures 3 4). For instance, the A or B genome homoeoallele of BE495400 and D genome homoeoallele of BF202265 were expressed in 1-month-old tissues of the hexaploids, but not expressed in 4-month-old samples. Similar expression patterns of these two ESTs were also observed in haploids (Figure 4). At the same time, full expression of all homoeoalleles of BF201235 were observed in both the 1- and 4-month-old shoot and 1-month-old root but not in the 4-month-old root of hexaploids and haploids. cDNA\xe2\x80\x93SSCP analysis of differentially expressed transcript with respect to a developmental process. Equal amounts of second-strand cDNA from a hexaploid (AABBDD) and a naturally produced polyhaploids (ABD) were PCR-amplified with conserved primers for each locus, and electrophoresed on MDE polyacrylamide gels. The arrows indicate the bands from different genome. To further understand the regulation of gene expression in polyhaploidization, we performed a global analysis of gene expression using the Affymetrix GeneChip. The microarray hybridization results revealed that a large number of loci had increased or decreased expressions after Yumai 21A polyhaploidization. Because the objective of this study was to exploit gene silencing and activation in polyhaploidization, we mainly focused on genes specifically expressed in either the haploid or hexaploid plants. The locus only expressed in haploids is defined as activated, reversely, as silenced. Among the 55,052 detected transcripts, 64 loci were activated and 227 loci were silenced in the shoot tissue of haploids, and the corresponding numbers were 138 loci and 28 loci in the roots (Table 1). The low numbers of loci being activated or silenced in haploids as compared to hexaploids confirmed our hypothesis that activation or silencing of homeologous transcripts are not the major strategy used for gene expression regulations after polyhaploidization (Table 2). Haploidy species rarely exist in nature. Almost all the extant haploids are created by the techniques such as another culture or parthenogenesis (Peng et al. 2008). However, the origination of haploid (Yumai 21H) was a mild process, which was free of inducing treatment or tissue culture and thus avoids artificial introduction of mutations. As a result, the ploidy series, which spontaneously originated under natural conditions, can partially imitate the natural ones and be used to precisely estimate ploidy effects in gene expression of crop polyploids. Four of the 30 arbitrarily selected sets of homeologous transcripts (\xe2\x88\xbc13%) showed altered expression patterns in a synthetic T. aestivum line and the T. turgidum and Ae. tauschii parents (Pumphrey et al. 2009). Suppression of Ae. tauschii D genome homoeoallele in synthetic T. aestivum line was observed for two differentially expressed transcripts, TC270558p and TC273936p. However, in our study, these two transcripts did not display altered expression patterns in the haploids, as compared with the hexaploids. Of the 30 arbitrary selected sets of homeologous transcripts, only one transcript (TC251989p) displayed different expression patterns in the haploid and its corresponding hexaploid form. Amplification and electrophoresis of a further 24 ESTs, for which at least one homoeoallele was known to be silenced in the variety Chinese Spring (Bottley et al. 2006), showed that there were no significant changes in the numbers of genome homoeoalleles between the haploid and hexaploid seedlings. Homoeoalleles silenced in Chinese spring (either leaf or root) were not become reactive in polyhaploidization. For instance, the A genome homoeoallele of EST BE426364 was silent in leaf tissue of Chinese spring (CS hexaploid), but it was not restored in haploids. A comparison of the expression patterns of 24 ESTs in a panel of wheat varieties appears in Table S2. Furthermore, our electrophoresis patterns of the homoeoalleles revealed that the expression of at least one copy of five ESTs (BE495400, BF484100, BF473379, BF201235, and BF202265) varied qualitatively in either the root or shoot tissue of the 4-month-old hexaploid with respect to a developmental process (Figures 3 and 4). Unexpectedly, a similar expression patterns for the three ESTs were also observed in the haploids (BE495400, BF201235, and BF202265). The expression patterns of these ESTs were regulated with respect to a developmental process, however, were not altered by polyhaploidization. All these results showed that the silencing or reactivation of homoeoalleles after haploidisation during a specific phase of haploids development is not widespread. To eliminate potential bias in the data collected using cDNA\xe2\x80\x93SSCP, we performed a global analysis of the gene expression patterns of haploid and hexaploid seedlings. Of the 55,052 genes probed, only about 0.41% in the shoots and 0.04% in the roots were silenced by polyhaploidization. This contrast with the high proportion of 5% of genes in newly synthesized wheat hexaploids (Kashkush et al. 2002) and 7\xe2\x80\x938% of genes in established wheat hexaploids (He et al. 2003) are silenced. One reason for these contradictions is that allopolyploids are often derived from a 2-step process: hybridization between 2 species and then doubling of all the chromosomes by the union of unreduced gametes (or by other mechanisms) (reviewed in Adams 2007). However, the polyhaploidization process is like the reversed way of autopolyploidy. Thus it cannot be directly compared with the allopolyploidization process and its effect on gene expression. Several studies have indicated that the effect of chromosome doubling on gene expression is much more insignificant than that of interspecific hybridization (Hegarty et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2006). For example, comparative proteomics of synthetic B. napus and its homozygous diploid progenitors B. rapa and B. oleracea showed that very few proteins disappeared or appeared in the amphiploids (<1%), but a strikingly high number (25\xe2\x80\x9338%) of polypeptides displayed quantitative nonadditive pattern (Albertin et al. 2006). Results in this study reveal that a set of chromosomal deletions are comparable with autopolyploidization in plants, which also has a minor effect on gene expression. Our results also reveal that the expression profiles of D genome homoeoallele are most frequently altered in haploids and hexaploids (Table 2). Bottley et al. (2006) reported a modest bias toward silencing of the D genome copies among leaf transcripts, but not among root transcripts. He et al. (2003) found that the homoeoalleles of D genomes were silenced twice as frequently as those from A or B genomes in a newly synthesized wheat hexaploid line. In contrast, no pattern of preferential silencing was detected in the newly synthesized wheat hexaploid \xc3\x97 hexaploid Aegilops hybrids (Kashkush et al. 2002). However, neither study provides evidence to support the hypothesis that there is a tendency toward selective silencing of homoeoallele from any one genome (Bottley and Koebner 2008; Bottley et al. 2008). The production of haploid plants and homozygous double-haploids of crop species accelerates breeding programs, improves selection efficiency, and facilitates genetic analysis (Sharma et al. 2002). When working with plants that are normally polyploid, it is very useful to work at a low ploidy level through haploid induction (Carputo and Barone 2005). In plants, the transition from hexaploids to haploids involves modifications to the phenotype, although the haploid form carries the same genetic material as the female parent. The haploid plants are dwarfish in height, show weaker growth, and have smaller flowers than the diploid plants (Belicuas 2007). However, the results of our experiments suggest that activation or silencing genome homoeoalleles are not the major effect of polyhaploidization on gene expression. Our findings raise the important issue of what causes the reduction in growth potential of the haploid. Further studies of polyhaploidization are required to explore the effects of gene dosage on gene expression in haploid forms.

Moreover, such copy numbers or genotypes are often incorrectly determined when microarray signal intensities derived from different copy numbers or genotypes are not clearly separated due to noise. Here we report an algorithm to infer CNV haplotypes and individuals\xe2\x80\x99 diplotypes at multiple loci from noisy microarray data, utilizing the probability that a signal intensity may be derived from different underlying copy numbers or genotypes. Performing simulation studies based on known diplotypes and an error model obtained from real microarray data, we demonstrate that this probabilistic approach succeeds in accurate inference (error rate: 1\xe2\x80\x932%) from noisy data, whereas previous deterministic approaches failed (error rate: 12\xe2\x80\x9318%). Applying this algorithm to real microarray data, we estimated haplotype frequencies and diplotypes in 1486 CNV regions for 100 individuals. Our algorithm will facilitate accurate population-genetic analyses and powerful disease association studies of CNVs.Large-scale studies employing high-throughput experimental technologies have recently revealed the genome-wide nature of copy number variations (CNVs) (Conrad et al. 2010; Freeman et al. 2006; Iafrate et al. 2004; Kato et al. 2010; McCarroll et al. 2008; Redon et al. 2006; Sebat et al. 2004), which are variations of the number of DNA segments >1 kilobase in size, and it is estimated that CNVs occupy as much as 4\xe2\x80\x936% of the human genome. The importance of CNVs in phenotypic traits and disease susceptibility has been revealed in their associations with HIV infection, autoimmunity, autism, schizophrenia, and cancer (Merikangas et al. 2009; Sebat 2007; Speleman et al. 2008). Currently, high-throughput experimental technologies for CNVs cannot provide data on a haplotype or diplotype (haplotype pair) of CNVs; instead, they provide data on the total number of copies over a diplotype or an unphased sequence genotype (e.g., AAB at a CNV locus, where A and B represent alleles) (Conrad and Hurles 2007; Kato et al. 2008a; Kato et al. 2008b). This unknown state of haplotypes hinders precise population-genetic analyses such as analyses of allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and population differentiation, as well as the development of efficient strategies for disease-association studies (McCarroll and Altshuler 2007). To obtain information on haplotypes, algorithms and computational tools have been developed to infer haplotypes from total copy numbers or unphased sequence genotypes (Kato et al. 2008a; Kato et al. 2008b; Shindo et al. 2009; Su et al. 2010). In this regard, algorithms using similar procedures have also been developed to infer haplotypes from the total copy numbers or unphased genotypes of >2 DNA copies in polyploid chromosomes (Clark et al. 2004; Neigenfind et al. 2008; Su et al. 2008). These algorithms are based on the implicit assumption that total copy numbers or unphased genotypes are measured with good accuracy. While reasonable for data from target-specific assays such as quantitative PCR and the RETINA technique (Hosono et al. 2008), as was previously demonstrated (Hosono et al. 2009), it is not always true for data from high-throughput genome-wide platforms such as microarrays. Microarray data are noisy overall (McCarroll and Altshuler 2007) and replicate experiments to correct these inaccuracies often difficult to repeat. Noise in microarrays causes uncertainty in the determination of total copy numbers or unphased genotypes. For example, when greater noise is present in a signal intensity deriving from a total copy number of 1, the observed measurement may get closer to a signal intensity expected from a total copy number of two rather than from one copy. Even though there might be a considerable degree of likelihood of the observed measurement deriving from a single copy, one might discard this possibility and errantly conclude two copies were present. Since previous tools cannot handle multiple possibilities with likelihood values, the use of wrongly determined total copy numbers as the input would lead to incorrect haplotype inference. To overcome this problem, we developed an algorithm that handles such likelihood values for CNV haplotype inference. This algorithm is designed as a post-process to be performed after a calling method, such as Birdsuite (Korn et al. 2008), determines the boundaries of CNVs and computes the parameters of a probabilistic model that determines the most probable total copy numbers or unphased genotypes in its framework. Likelihood values as inputs of our algorithm are given through such a probabilistic model. We implemented this algorithm in a computational tool called CNVphaserPro (CNV phasing tool using probabilistic information). This tool can infer haplotypes composed of not only integer copy numbers (ICNs) but also single nucleotide variations in a CNV (SNVCs) (Kato et al. 2008a) and SNPs, whose relationship is illustrated in Figure 1. As a by-product, this tool can also estimate individual\xe2\x80\x99s diplotypes. We performed simulation studies based on known haplotypes and real microarray noise, demonstrating that this tool successfully inferred haplotypes and diplotypes from noisy microarray data, and that the tool even had an ability to correct total copy numbers and unphased genotypes that are wrongly determined due to noise. Encouraged by the success in simulation studies, we applied the tool to real microarray data for individuals of European descent from Utah (CEU) and obtained the estimation of haplotype frequencies and individuals\xe2\x80\x99 diplotypes in 1486 CNV regions along the human genome.'","b'Accurate information on haplotypes and diplotypes (haplotype pairs) is required for population-genetic analyses; however, microarrays do not provide data on a haplotype or diplotype at a copy number variation (CNV) locus; they only provide data on the total number of copies over a diplotype or an unphased sequence genotype (e.g., AAB, unlike AB of single nucleotide polymorphism). Moreover, such copy numbers or genotypes are often incorrectly determined when microarray signal intensities derived from different copy numbers or genotypes are not clearly separated due to noise. Here we report an algorithm to infer CNV haplotypes and individuals\xe2\x80\x99 diplotypes at multiple loci from noisy microarray data, utilizing the probability that a signal intensity may be derived from different underlying copy numbers or genotypes. Performing simulation studies based on known diplotypes and an error model obtained from real microarray data, we demonstrate that this probabilistic approach succeeds in accurate inference (error rate: 1\xe2\x80\x932%) from noisy data, whereas previous deterministic approaches failed (error rate: 12\xe2\x80\x9318%). Applying this algorithm to real microarray data, we estimated haplotype frequencies and diplotypes in 1486 CNV regions for 100 individuals.

A \xe2\x80\x9ccopy unit\xe2\x80\x9d represents the unit of DNA sequence that is duplicated in a CNV region (Kato et al. 2008a). In this illustration, most invariant bases in copy units are omitted for the purpose of simplicity. Lower part: High-throughput experimental technologies give data on the total number of copies over a diplotype or an unphased sequence genotype. The aim of the algorithm is to estimate the frequencies of haplotypes from a group of total copy numbers and/or unphased genotypes with likelihood values for randomly sampled individuals. Here we call a total copy number the total number of allelic copies over a diplotype (a pair of haplotypes) at an ICN site. For example, allelic copy number 1 in one haplotype and allelic copy number 2 in the other haplotype at an ICN site result in the total copy number of 3. We call an unphased genotype a nucleotide sequence for which the phase is unknown but the total number of each allelic nucleotide base over a diplotype at an SNVC site is known. For example, regarding the unphased genotype AAG at an SNVC site, the phase is unknown (it may be A in one haplotype and both A and G in the other haplotype, or both A and A in one haplotype and G in the other haplotype, or another) but the total numbers of the alleles A and G are known as two and one, respectively (Figure 1). For that aim, we combined an algorithm of Kang et al. (Kang et al. 2004) with the algorithms of CNVphaser (Kato et al. 2008a) and MOCSphaser (Kato et al. 2008b) so that the proposed algorithm could incorporate likelihood values for total copy numbers and unphased genotypes into the framework of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for CNV phasing. The algorithm by Kang et al., which is called the GenoSpectrum-EM algorithm, uses the EM algorithm that considers likelihood values for SNP genotypes to infer SNP haplotypes, not CNV haplotypes. CNVphaser and MOCSphaser use the EM algorithm to infer CNV haplotypes from total copy numbers and unphased SNVC genotypes, but do not consider likelihood values for total copy numbers or unphased genotypes. The proposed EM algorithm can be divided into two procedures: enumeration and iterative calculation. In the initial procedure, we enumerate all possible diplotypes that are consistent with total copy numbers or unphased genotypes across multiple sites for every individual. More specifically, we first enumerate all possible diplotypes per site. For example, if a total copy number at an ICN site is 3, all possible diplotypes we enumerate are [0/3] and [1/2], where a slash (/) represents the separator between haplotypes (we do not distinguish the order of haplotypes). Similarly, if an unphased genotype at an SNVC site is AAG, all possible diplotypes are [-/A, A, G], [A, A/G], and [A/A, G], where a dash (-) represents a deletion and a comma (,) represents the separator between copy units (we do not distinguish the order of copy units in a haplotype). Here, we call a copy unit the unit of DNA sequence that is duplicated in a CNV region (Figure 1). Then, we enumerate all possible diplotypes across multiple sites. For example, if we have the one-site diplotypes [0/3] and [1/2] at an ICN site, and the one-site diplotype [a/t] at an SNP site, all the possible diplotypes across these two sites are [0_a/3_t], [0_t/3_a], [1_a/2_t], and [1_t/2_a], where an underscore (_) represents the separator between sites. In this procedure, we also calculate a likelihood across multiple sites for each diplotype, following the assumption of Kang et al. (2004) that the occurrence of an experimental measurement, such as a signal intensity, at one site given a diplotype is independent of that at another site (also see Equations 1 and 6 below). Note that this assumption does not require linkage equilibrium \xe2\x80\x93 copy numbers or genotypes at multiple sites are independent of each other. Also note that, for microarray probes that are determined to be in the same state by a segmentation tool, it might be necessary to aggregate the correlated measurement values (e.g., through median) into one value to treat the probe locations as one site. Under the assumption, the likelihood \xce\xbbj,k is calculated as follows:(1)where k denotes the index for the diplotype of individual j, and s and S denote the index for a site and the total number of sites in a given dataset, respectively. The variable xj,k denotes the observed measurements such as the signal intensities or the log ratio intensities across multiple sites, and xj,k,s denotes the observed measurement at site s in xj,k. The symbol dj,k denotes the diplotype indexed by k for individual j across multiple sites, and dj,k,s denotes the one-site diplotype at site s in dj,k. The last term Pr(xj,k,s | dj,k,s) is equal to the probability of xj,k,s given the total copy number or unphased genotype of diplotype dj,k,s (because we do not distinguish the signal intensities of, for example, [0/3] and [1/2]), and this probability is calculated from a statistical model of signal intensities or log ratio intensities in microarrays. The choice of a statistical model and a method to estimate its parameters is left to a user. For example, in simulation studies, we used those of Birdsuite (Korn et al. 2008), which employs a Gaussian mixture model and parameter estimation by the expectation-maximization algorithm. We obtained the last term probability, or likelihood, directly from the probability density of a signal intensity in a normal distribution of the model. After enumeration, we perform the iterative calculation, in which we iteratively repeat the expectation (E) and the maximization (M) steps. In the E step, we calculate the proportion of the frequency of a diplotype to the sum of the frequencies of all diplotypes in an individual, using likelihood \xce\xbbj,k. The equation at the E step is:(2)where wj,k denotes the diplotype proportion, Dj denotes the number of possible diplotypes of individual j, and P denotes the population frequency. P(dj,k) is calculated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE):(3)where the diplotype dj,k consists of the haplotypes indexed by l and m (hl and hm). At the M step, the frequency of a haplotype is calculated from the number of the haplotype in consideration of the diplotype proportion calculated at the E step. The equation at the M step is:(4)(5)where N denotes the number of individuals in the dataset. After this M step, the iteration goes back to the E step to update the diplotype proportion, and in turn goes to the M step to update the haplotype frequency until the log-likelihood converges. The log-likelihood ln L is:(6)where \xce\xb8 denotes (P(h1), P(h2), ...). The main difference of this EM algorithm from those of CNVphaser (Kato et al. 2008a) and MOCSphaser (Kato et al. 2008b) is the inclusion of the likelihood term \xce\xbbj,k in equations 2 and 6. By incorporating this term, total copy numbers and/or unphased genotypes are probabilistically represented. Equations 3, 4, and 5 are the same. The main difference of our algorithm from the GenoSpectrum-EM algorithm of Kang et al. (Kang et al. 2004) lies in the enumeration procedure, in which our algorithm can enumerate diplotypes composed of any combination of ICNs, SNVCs, and SNPs, whereas Kang et al.\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm enumerates diplotypes composed only of SNPs. The equations in our EM algorithm are essentially the same as those in Kang et al.\xe2\x80\x99s EM algorithm. We implemented this algorithm into a computational tool called CNVphaserPro, which is available online (http://rulai.cshl.edu/people/kato/). The advancements of this tool from the previous tools (Kato et al. 2008a; Kato et al. 2008b) are shown in the supporting information, Table S1. The tool can handle missing calls and use multiple sets of randomly-generated initial values for multiple EM runs. We tested whether the algorithm could correctly restore haplotype frequencies in simulated datasets, which were made as follows (Figure 2). We first obtained unphased genotypes from the known haplotypes (listed in File S1) of 588 individuals at 14 sites (Sachse et al. 1997), and then randomly generated signal intensities for the unphased genotypes at each site, using two-dimensional normal distributions for the genotypes. Their means and variances were derived from real microarray data (Korn et al. 2008). Next, we used these normal distributions to calculate the probability densities of the signal intensities for all possible unphased genotypes and used them as likelihood values. For total copy numbers, we took the summation of the likelihood values across unphased genotypes with the same copy number to obtain the likelihood values of total copy numbers. See File S2 for details on generating the simulation data. We input the likelihood values separately at each site into CNVphaserPro for one-site inference. We used the known haplotypes directly as the answer haplotypes. Illustration of simulation. \xe2\x80\x9cInd.\xe2\x80\x9d is short for individuals. The symbols \xe2\x80\x9c-\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9c/\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9c,\xe2\x80\x9d in the top left table represent a deletion, the separator between haplotypes, and the separator between copy units in a duplication. (1) Using known diplotypes (Sachse et al. 1997), we made unphased genotypes. (2) We randomly generated signal intensities for the unphased genotypes, using normal distributions with the means and variances taken from real microarray data (Korn et al. 2008). (3) We calculated the likelihoods of the signal intensities for all possible unphased genotypes (or total copy numbers), based on the normal distributions above. We first show an example of our results on one-site ICN inference (Table 1). The estimated frequencies were all close to the answer frequencies; hence, we concluded that the algorithm succeeds in the estimation. For comparison, we estimated haplotype frequencies by the previous algorithm [of MOCSphaser (Kato et al. 2008b) and CNVphaser (Kato et al. 2008a)], using the most likely total copy numbers as the input, which were defined as the one with the largest likelihood value of all possible total copy numbers. As demonstrated previously (Excoffier and Slatkin 1995; Kato et al. 2008a; Kato et al. 2008b), we quantified the degree of estimation error by the total variation distance TV:(7)where  and  are the true and estimated frequencies of the haplotype i. As a result, the estimation error of the current algorithm was much less than that of the previous algorithm (the error rate 2% vs. 12%) (Table 2). When we compared the most likely total copy numbers with the answer total copy numbers, 22% were incorrect, on average. This indicates that total copy numbers determined with the largest likelihood value are often incorrect due to microarray noise, which would result in the poorer estimates by the previous algorithm. We also inferred individuals\xe2\x80\x99 diplotypes of ICNs by selecting the diplotype with the largest diplotype proportion value in equation 2 (we did not use a threshold), and then evaluated inference accuracy by the proportion of inferred diplotypes that were the same as the answers. The result showed a good accuracy, 95% on average (Table 3). We also used this proportion as the rate of total copy numbers correctly inferred by the current algorithm, because total copy numbers can be obtained simply from diplotypes. Thus, we compared this rate with the rate of correct ones of the most likely total copy numbers. As a result, the former rate (95%) was clearly larger than the latter rate (78%) (Table 3), which indicates that the current algorithm has an ability to correct total copy numbers incorrectly determined with the largest likelihood value. In fact, there were total copy numbers that were incorrectly determined with the largest likelihood value but were correctly inferred by the current algorithm; though we did find some, albeit far fewer, of the opposite case (Table 3). We also estimated the frequencies of haplotypes at one- and two-SNVC sites. In the two-site case, we chose pairs out of the 14 sites randomly a total of 14 times and input simulated likelihood values at the pairs into our algorithm. We show examples of results in both cases (Table 1), which demonstrates that the estimated frequencies were almost the same as the answer frequencies. The TV index revealed that the estimation error of the current algorithm was much less than that of the previous algorithm (the error rate 1\xe2\x80\x932% vs. 12\xe2\x80\x9318%) (Table 2). Regarding the inference of individuals\xe2\x80\x99 diplotypes, the inference results also showed a good accuracy: on average, 95\xe2\x80\x9396% were correct in both cases (Table 3). As with ICNs, the current algorithm corrected unphased genotypes that were incorrectly determined with the largest likelihood value (Table 3). Most importantly, improvement by the current algorithm from the previous algorithm was greater in the case of two SNVC sites, which is more complicated than the single ICN and SNVC cases. We examined the influence of sample size on algorithm performance. For that purpose, we used population frequencies calculated from the known haplotypes of the 588 individuals to randomly sample haplotypes, and then randomly paired them on the basis of HWE to make answer datasets with different simple sizes. We made 10 replicate answer sets for each simple size. For each answer set, we used the same procedures as in the first simulation to make an input dataset. As a result, with the increase of the sample size, the current algorithm showed a slight but constant improvement in both the TV performance and the accuracy of inferred genotypes (Figure 3) or inferred copy numbers (data not shown), though the values of both indices were nearly saturated. In contrast, the previous procedures (the previous algorithm and the method to determine unphased copy numbers or genotypes by the largest likelihood value) did not always show a constant improvement. The current algorithm showed a better TV performance and a better genotype or copy-number inference at all sample sizes as compared to the previous procedures. In the two-SNVC case, the current algorithm showed the largest difference in TV and the accuracy from the previous procedures. In all the cases, the accuracy of diplotypes inferred by the current algorithm was greater than 90% even at a sample size of 50 and greater than 95% at a sample size of 100 or more. The TV values were extremely low at any sample size in all the cases (6% at a sample size of 50 at two-SNVC sites; less than 4%, otherwise). Influence of sample size on performance. The left y-axis represents the deviation (the TV index) of estimated haplotype frequencies from answer frequencies for the current (red line with circles) and the previous (red line with crosses) algorithms. The right y-axis represents the proportion of diplotypes correctly inferred by the current algorithm (blue line with circles) or unphased genotypes correctly determined with the largest likelihood value (blue line with crosses). Points in the y-axes at each sample size indicate the mean of values over 10 different answer sets \xc3\x97 14 different site sets. (A) For one SNVC site. (B) For two SNVC sites. The result of one ICN site is not shown, because this result was similar to that of one SNVC site. We applied the phasing tool to real data taken with NimbleGen HD2 comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays for the HapMap Phase3 CEU population. We identified 1486 CNV regions for 106 unrelated individuals, and then used the median log-ratio intensities across probes present in the intersections of CNV segments to obtain their likelihood values for the total copy numbers of zero to four, based on the Gaussian mixture model. See File S3 for details on processing the real data. We next applied the phasing tool to the likelihood values and estimated haplotype frequencies (File S4) and diplotypes (File S5) in the CNV regions along the genome. We compared the predicted diplotypes (with the diplotype proportions > 0.98) of two individuals to deletions that were extensively detected by next-generation sequencing at a high coverage (42\xc3\x97) for the same individuals (Mills et al. 2011). We found that eight out of the nine of our deletions were consistent with theirs and only 3.3% (65/1983) out of our 1/1 diplotypes were inconsistent. Using all the CNV regions, we drew an allele frequency spectrum (Figure 4)\xe2\x80\x94a basic graph that summarizes their population-genetic nature. The graph shows that the zero-copy (A0) and two-copy (A2) alleles tended to have small frequencies and that the number of the zero-copy allele was somewhat larger than that of the two-copy allele. We found 15 CNV regions where both zero-copy and two-copy alleles had the population frequencies of more than 1%, which indicates that these are tri-allelic. Twelve out of the fifteen were overlapped with CNVs in the Database of Genomic Variants (Zhang et al. 2006) and eight out of the twelve had been defined as multi-allelic CNVs (having both gains and losses) in CEU or a French population (Conrad et al. 2010; De Smith et al. 2007). We show examples of such CNV regions overlapped with genes (Table 4). The CNVs overlapped with ACOT11 and CWF19L2 were previously reported as multi-allelic in CEU (Conrad et al. 2010), but the CNV overlapped with EYA2 was not reported. A homolog to ACOT11 in mouse has been associated with obesity, but the function of CWF19L2 is unknown. EYA2 may play a role in eye development. Frequency spectrums. The width of each bin is 2%. Alleles with a very small [<1 / (2 \xc3\x97 the number of individuals)] or large [>1 \xe2\x88\x92 1 / (2 \xc3\x97 the number of individuals)] frequency are excluded from the counts. (A) The frequency spectrum of alleles. An (n = 0, 1, and 2) in the box represents an allelic copy number. (B) The frequency spectrum of total copy numbers derived from the allelic copy numbers. Tn (n = 0, 1, ..., 4) in the box represents an total copy number. We used simulated datasets that were as close to real haplotypes and microarray noise levels as possible, and we demonstrated successful estimation by our algorithm. The reason for this success is the use of likelihoods to quantify fluctuations caused by noise. For example, even when a signal intensity is observed far away from the center of a distribution of the original total copy number, our algorithm does not discard the possibility that the signal came from this copy number, but considers the signal as a rare outcome with a small likelihood value. The usefulness of this strategy of incorporating genotype likelihoods (instead of called genotypes) into haplotype frequency estimation was demonstrated in SNP cases (Browning and Yu 2009; Kang et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2009). For example, in one recent study using BEAGLE version 3.1 (Browning and Yu 2009), this strategy was incorporated into SNP haplotype phasing based on an hidden Markov model (HMM). In our study, combining likelihoods with the EM algorithm based on a multinomial model (Excoffier and Slatkin 1995), we demonstrated its usefulness in CNV haplotype inference. As a by-product, our algorithm also inferred individuals\xe2\x80\x99 diplotypes. The accuracy of the diplotype inference went over 90% even at a sample size of 50 and over 95% at a sample size of 100 or more, which indicates that even a sample size around 100 is enough for a good inference in typical cases. By accurately inferring diplotypes, the algorithm even corrected total copy numbers or unphased genotypes that were incorrectly determined with the largest likelihood value. Substantial amounts of 21\xe2\x80\x9334% incorrect rates were decreased to only 4\xe2\x80\x935% through correction by the current algorithm. Most importantly, as the sample size increased, the estimation error index TV and the accuracy of estimated total copy numbers or unphased genotypes were improved in the current algorithm, but not always in the previous procedures. This is because there are always incorrect unphased copy numbers or genotypes determined with the largest likelihood value regardless of increasing a sample size (as shown by the blue lines with cross in Figure 3), as long as signal intensities coming from different unphased copy numbers or genotypes are not clearly separated with each other. Thus, increasing a sample size does not always improve estimation accuracy in the previous algorithm, but does so in the current algorithm\xe2\x80\x94this is another advantage of the current algorithm. There would be several algorithmic issues to be addressed in the future. Our algorithm assumes HWE; hence, if a population does not satisfy HWE, the estimation would be worse. Regarding the EM algorithm used in SNP haplotype inference, it is known that deviations from HWE do not greatly impact the accuracy (Niu et al. 2002). In addition, a large-scale CNV study has found that most CNVs (98% of the bi-allelic CNVs) are in HWE (McCarroll et al. 2008). Furthermore, in the first type of simulation, we demonstrated accurate estimation by our algorithm for known haplotypes in a natural population, in which HWE was not artificially introduced. Nevertheless, it is necessary to know how much impact deviations from HWE have on the accuracy. Another issue is to handle haplotypes composed of a number of sites. Currently, to analyze haplotypes composed of a few sites meets the needs for practical applications in CNV research, because urgent issues in this field are, first, association studies of CNVs, where current studies handle CNV regions as single sites (loci) and perform statistical tests separately per region (Stefansson et al. 2008; The International Schizophrenia Consortium 2008), and second, to find CNVs tagged by SNPs, where two-site haplotypes composed of an ICN and a SNP sites are phased to calculate a two-site LD index such as R2 (Conrad et al. 2010; Kato et al. 2010; McCarroll et al. 2008). Our algorithm can fulfill these needs. In fact, our algorithm finished calculations for one and two sites across 588 samples within a short time (13 and 187 sec on average for one and two sites, respectively) on our machine with eight Xeon 2-GHz CPUs and 8 GB RAM, and also for three sites within a reasonable time (49 min on average). In addition, the algorithm inferred allelic copy numbers in all the 1486 CNV regions in the real data application within 18 hr on the same machine. However, our EM-based algorithm may not be suitable for applications beyond the current needs, since it takes significant time to handle a large number of sites due to the exhaustive enumeration. For example, our algorithm did not complete calculations within a reasonable time (24 hr) for four sites in some datasets, though the computational time can be reduced to some degree by cutting off states with the likelihood value of zero or nearly zero (after normalizing likelihood values, since only the relative values are meaningful). For applications beyond the current urgent needs, the algorithm will have to be improved. For example, recently the GrEM algorithm (Shindo et al. 2009) and the algorithm implemented in polyHap v2.0 (Su et al. 2010), which uses an HMM, have been proposed to deal with a larger number of sites for CNV haplotype inference from data unambiguously determined. They could be extended or modified to accommodate data with noise. In addition, a computational tool called cnvHap has recently been developed in order to call (unphased) copy numbers or sequence genotypes based on a haplotype HMM (Coin et al. 2010). Although the aim of cnvHap is not to estimate haplotype frequencies, information on haplotypes might be extracted from this approach. Other possible approaches include partition-ligation EM (Kato et al. 2008a; Qin et al. 2002), Gibbs sampling, and coalescent-based sampling (Niu 2004). We applied our tool to real ICN data. Although we demonstrated accurate inference of SNVC haplotypes in simulation studies, it will be worth trying real SNVC data when such data in a large sample size (>100 individuals) are accessible. Regarding association studies of CNVs, current studies using microarrays focus on ICNs or ICN groups known as gains (>2 copies) and losses (<2 copies). Recently, a theoretical study examined statistical power in association studies based on ICN haplotypes (Ohashi 2009). Because SNVCs, which are a form of variation mixed of SNPs and ICNs, are more likely to have a phenotypic effect than only SNPs or only ICNs (Hosono et al. 2008; Kato et al. 2008a), it would be important that these studies are extended for SNVC haplotypes, in which case, our algorithm will be of essential use. Because microarrays are currently less costly than next-generation sequencing in the same sample size in genome-wide CNV studies, our haplotype phasing based on microarray data are cost effective for rapidly investigating hundreds or thousands of individuals. Recently, a study has developed a successful method to estimate total copy numbers from read depth in next-generation sequencing and applied it to three individuals (Alkan et al. 2009). Taking account of the fact that read counts fluctuate by noise (Yoon et al. 2009), our likelihood method would be applicable also for such copy numbers when sample size is sufficiently obtained in the future.

We identified 156 (of 4653 total) strains unable to grow in the presence of hygromycin B, a phenotype previously shown to be indicative of ion defects. The most abundant group was that with deletions of genes known to encode membrane traffic regulators. Nearly 80% of these membrane traffic defective strains showed defects in uptake of the K+ homolog, 86Rb+. Since Trk1, a plasma membrane protein localized to lipid microdomains, is the major K+ influx transporter, we examined the subcellular localization and Triton-X 100 insolubility of Trk1 in 29 of the traffic mutants. However, few of these showed defects in the steady state levels of Trk1, the localization of Trk1 to the plasma membrane, or the localization of Trk1 to lipid microdomains, and most defects were mild compared to wild-type. Three inositol kinase mutants were also identified, and in contrast, loss of these genes negatively affected Trk1 protein levels. In summary, this work reveals a nexus between K+ homeostasis and membrane traffic, which does not involve traffic of the major influx transporter, Trk1.K+ is the major cation in cells, present at submolar concentrations (0.05\xe2\x80\x930.2 M) in the cytoplasm, concentrated \xe2\x88\xbc1000-fold relative to the external environment (Rodriguez-Navarro, 2000, Perkins and Gadd 1993). High intracellular levels of K+ are required for replication and translation (Lubin, 1964, Lubin and Ennis, 1964, Lubin 1967). Further, K+ is required for uptake of nutrients, disposal of metabolic by-products, and cell\xe2\x80\x93cell communication in multicellular organisms, particularly in neural tissue. In addition, asymmetric K+ fluxes very early in vertebrate development are required for left-right asymmetry (Levin et al., 2002, Raya et al., 2004), dependent upon Kir4.1 and the H+/K+-ATPase (Aw et al., 2008), while later in development, formation of the neural crest depends upon the activity of cation/H+-antiporters (Manohar et al., 2010). In yeast at least, K+ is also required for cell cycle progression (Masuda et al., 2000), but it is not currently known whether this is a feature of cell cycle control in higher eukaryotes. In yeast, K+ import is accomplished primarily by the K+ influx transporter, Trk1 (Gaber, 1992, Ko et al., 1990, Ko and Gaber, 1991, Ramos et al., 1994). A paralog of Trk1, named Trk2, has been referred to as a low- or medium-affinity transporter (Ko et al., 1990), which is apparently only expressed under specific conditions, including low external K+ or low external pH (Michel et al., 2006). The protein Qdr2 may also play a minor role in Trk-independent K+ uptake (Vargas et al., 2007). trk1\xce\x94 trk2\xce\x94 mutants are sensitive to toxic cations including hygromycin B and show deficient K+ uptake (Madrid et al., 1998, Navarrete et al., 2010). sat4/hal4\xce\x94 hal5\xce\x94 double mutants also exhibit cation sensitivity and deficient K+ uptake (P\xc3\xa9rez-Valle et al., 2007). Overexpression of SAT4/HAL4 or HAL5, which encode serine/threonine kinases, increases tolerance to toxic cations; however, overexpression of these genes in a trk1\xce\x94 trk2\xce\x94 background is without effect, suggesting that Hal4 and Hal5 act to regulate the activity or stability of Trk1 and Trk2 (Mulet et al., 1999). Recent work also implicates calcineurin as a factor in the regulation of Trk1 via the Hal proteins (Casado et al., 2010). Other regulators of Trk-dependent K+ import include the serine/threonine phosphatases Ppz1 and Ppz2. The Ppz proteins have diverse functions in ion homeostasis, cell wall maintenance, and regulation of cell growth and division (Posas et al., 1995, Clotet et al., 1999). PPZ1 overexpression decreases uptake of the K+ homolog, 86Rb+, while ppz1\xce\x94 ppz2\xce\x94 mutants are resistant to toxic cations (Yenush et al., 2002). Hal3 directly interacts with the Ppz proteins, decreasing their phosphatase activity, and cells lacking functional Hal3 demonstrate decreased 86Rb+ uptake compared to wild-type cells (Yenush et al., 2002, De Nadal et al., 1999, Yenush et al., 2005). Vhs3, homologous to Hal3, also negatively regulates Ppz1 activity (Ruiz et al., 2004a). In addition to the kinases and phosphatases mentioned above, we previously found that loss of the guanine-nucleotide binding protein gene, ARL1, causes increased sensitivity to toxic cations including hygromcyin B, correlating with decreased K+ influx, which is suppressed by additional K+ in the medium (Munson et al., 2004a). Although Arl1 in both yeast and mammals has documented roles in regulation of membrane traffic (Rosenwald et al., 2002, Love et al., 2004, Lu et al., 2001, Lowe et al., 1996, Munro, 2005, Panic et al., 2003, Liu et al., 2005, Behnia et al., 2004), Arl1 does not control traffic of Trk1: loss of ARL1 has no effect on steady levels or localization of Trk1 to the plasma membrane (Munson et al., 2004a). In addition, loss of ARL1 has no effect on localization of Trk1 to lipid microdomains (this work). To identify other genes which potentially play a role K+ homeostasis, we screened the homozygous diploid deletion collection of viable yeast mutants (Winzeler et al., 1999) for strains exhibiting a hygromycin B-sensitive phenotype. We identified a number of such mutants and found that many of them had deletions of genes previously shown to encode regulators of membrane traffic. The connection between K+ and membrane traffic was first identified more than 20 years ago, when it was shown that K+ was important in mammalian cells for clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Heuser and Anderson, 1989, Larkin et al., 1986, Larkin et al., 1985, Larkin et al., 1983). It has been suggested that K+ is required for the activity of the clathrin uncoating ATPase, Hsc70 (O'Brien and Mckay, 1995, Wilbanks and Mckay 1995). Newer data show that depletion of intracellular K+ also affects clathrin-independent endocytosis (mediated primarily by caveolae) (Vercauteren et al., 2010) and that effects of K+-depletion on endocytic functions are cell-type specific (Vercauteren et al., 2010), suggesting there is at least one other mechanism responsible in addition to possible inhibition of the uncoating ATPase. Work in mammalian cells has also shown that aminoglycoside antibiotics like hygromycin B bind to coatomer subunits (Hudson and Draper 1997). Membrane traffic in yeast is controlled by regulation of cytosolic vs. lumenal pH and K+ specifically by the activity of Nhx1/Vps44, a Na+-K+/H+ exchanger localized to late endosomal membranes (Ali et al., 2004, Brett et al., 2005). Together, these data demonstrate a role for K+ in ensuring effective membrane trafficking. It would therefore be reasonable for gene products involved in membrane traffic to have a role in modulating K+ for the purpose of optimizing membrane traffic. Indeed, one previous study suggested a role for the SNARE protein SYP121 in K+ channel gating in Arabidopsis (Honsbein et al., 2009). In general, however, the molecular details that underlie connections between K+ homeostasis and membrane traffic have not been fully elucidated. In this paper, therefore, by identification of numerous membrane traffic regulators as mediators of K+ influx, we have made a step toward delineating these connections. While others have also discovered that membrane traffic mutants are sensitive to hygromycin B (recent examples include [Banuelos et al. (2010), Dudley et al. (2005), and Conboy and Cyert (2000)], the novel aspects of this work are the findings that many of these mutants show deficient K+ uptake and that some phenotypes can be suppressed by the addition of excess K+ in the medium. However, for the majority of mutants examined, although defective for K+ uptake, wild-type levels of Trk1, correct localization of Trk1 to the plasma membrane fraction, and correct localization to lipid microdomains were observed. Thus, our new results demonstrate that a number of different membrane traffic genes in addition to Arl1 also regulate K+ uptake. However, our results are consistent with a model in which defective regulation of Trk1 activity occurs rather than defective localization.""","b""Using the homozygous diploid Saccharomyces deletion collection, we searched for strains with defects in K+ homeostasis.

However, our results are consistent with a model in which defective regulation of Trk1 activity occurs rather than defective localization. The 4653 homozygous diploid mutant strains used in this study were obtained from OpenBiosystems (formerly Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Each S. cerevisiae strain in the collection lacks both copies of a single nonessential gene (Winzeler et al., 1999). The parental strain is BY4743 (MAT\xce\xb1/MATa his3\xce\x941/his3\xce\x941 leu2\xce\x940/leu2\xce\x940 +/ met15\xce\x940 +/lys2\xce\x940 ura3\xce\x940/ura3\xce\x940). The web site http://www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/yeast_deletion_project/deletions3.html provides further information about the collection. Briefly, a PCR-based technique was used to generate a short KanMX sequence flanked by sequences immediately up- and downstream of the open-reading frame to be deleted. These constructs were then transformed into cells to create the deletion strains of interest. The KanMX cassette confers geneticin (G418) resistance for selection. Plasmid pAM7904, containing an HA-tagged allele of TRK1, was constructed by first amplifying the TRK1 locus from wild-type genomic DNA [prepared as described (Burns et al., 1996)] using oligonucleotides GT127 and GT128 (Table 1), both of which contain BamHI sites. The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI, followed by ligation into YEp352 (Hill et al., 1986) to create pAW4. An AflII site approximately 60 bp from the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the open-reading frame was used to insert a fragment encoding 3 HA tags in frame, created using oligonucleotides GT179 and GT180. Correct insertion was confirmed by SacI digestion and by PCR using oligonucleotides GT178 and GT106, which bind upstream and downstream, respectively, of the insertion. pAM7904 complemented the hygromycin B sensitive phenotype of a trk1\xce\x94 strain as well as pAW4, demonstrating the tagged allele was functional. Expression of the HA tag was detected by Western blot analysis only in strains transformed with pAM7904, but not in strains transformed with pAW4 (containing untagged TRK1) or YEp352 (empty vector) (data not shown). Plasmids were transformed into strains of interest (Ito et al., 1983) with heat shock times extended up to 2 hr. Media were prepared according to established procedures (Adams et al., 1997, Sherman et al., 1974). Cells were grown in rich YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% dextrose, 2% peptone) or YPAD medium (YPD with the addition of 40 mg/L adenine sulfate) or minimal SD medium (0.15% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids or ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% dextrose) with necessary supplements to cover auxotrophies. For solid media, 2% agar was added. Heat-sensitive components, such as hygromycin B, were added after autoclaving, when the media had cooled to approximately 50\xc2\xb0C. Dextrose, ammonium sulfate, yeast extract, peptone, yeast nitrogen base, and agar were from Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA). Amino acid and base supplements, KCl, hygromycin B, and sorbitol were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The 4653 deletion strains were originally obtained in 96-well microtiter plates. The strains in each plate were spotted onto solid YPD medium, then replica printed onto YPD medium with or without 0.1 mg/mL hygromycin B for the primary screen. Strains showing hygromycin B sensitivity were selected and subjected to a second round of screening as follows. Selected strains were grown in YPD at 30\xc2\xb0C to saturation. Concentrations were standardized to an OD600 of 1.0, and each sample was 10-fold serially diluted and spotted with a replicator tool onto solid YPD medium with or without 0.075 mg/ml hygromycin B and with or without 100 or 500 mm KCl. Growth was scored after 4 days of incubation at 30\xc2\xb0C. Typical results are shown in Figure 1; the complete data set is shown in supporting information, Table S1A, Table S1B, and Table S1C. Representative data showing the three classes of hygromcyin B-sensitive mutants. The homozygous diploid deletion collection of 4653 strains was screened for sensitivity to hygromycin B in the presence or absence of added K+ (100 mm or 500 mm). Some strains displayed drug sensitivity that was suppressed by 100 mm KCl (including arl1\xe2\x88\x86, vps8\xe2\x88\x86, vps9\xe2\x88\x86, and pep5\xe2\x88\x86), others required 500 mm KCl for sensitivity to be suppressed (including arf1\xe2\x88\x86 and per1\xe2\x88\x86), and others were not suppressed at all by the inclusion of KCl (including vps16\xe2\x88\x86 and vps54\xe2\x88\x86). For the complete data set, see Table S1A, Table S1B, and Table S1C. YPAD = normal rich growth medium, + Hyg B = with the addition of 0.075 mg/ml hygromycin B with no addition, or with the addition of 100 mm KCl or 500 mm KCl. The indicated strains were grown overnight in YPAD medium, then diluted to 1.0 OD600/ml and subjected to 1:10 serial dilutions, spotted onto the indicated plates with a replicator tool, then grown for 2 days at 30\xc2\xb0C. The total data set is reported in Table S1A, Table S1B, and Table S1C. Selected strains were tested for their ability to take up 86Rb+, a homolog of K+. Triplicate measurements of 86Rb+ uptake were performed as previously described (Mulet et al., 1999, Manlandro et al., 2005, Munson et al., 2004a). Briefly, cells were grown to log phase in SD medium with appropriate supplements and 200 mm KCl. Five ODs were harvested, washed three times in distilled water, resuspended in 500 \xce\xbcL reaction medium (50 mm succinic acid, pH 5.5, 4% glucose). 86RbCl (1.1 \xce\xbcCi, 0.2 mm final concentration; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) was added to each sample and 100 \xce\xbcL aliquots were taken over time, then diluted into 10 mL ice cold 20 mm MgCl2 to halt uptake. Cells were filtered over nitrocellulose membranes, washed three times with ice-cold 20 mm MgCl2 (10 mL each wash), and filter-bound radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting in UltimaGold XR scintillation fluid (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA) using an LS 3801 scintillation counter (Beckman, Brea, CA). Uptake by each strain was measured on at least two different days; in each experiment, the wild-type strain was tested and average uptake was set to 100%. Typical results are shown in Figure 2; the complete data set is shown in Table S3. To measure 86Rb+ efflux, cells were incubated with 86RbCl for 60 min, then pelleted and resuspended in medium containing 0.2 mm (cold) RbCl. Aliquots of the cell suspension were removed over time and washed on filters as above. Representative data showing 86Rb+ uptake. Examples of data taken from the 86Rb+ uptake assay. Most membrane traffic mutants tested showed low levels of 86Rb+ uptake (arl1\xce\x94, \xe2\x96\xb4 = vps8\xce\x94, x = vps9\xce\x94, \xe2\x88\x86 = vps21\xce\x94, and + = mon2\xce\x94. Each strain was tested in triplicate on at least two different occasions. The data are summarized for the class I membrane traffic strains in Table 3. The total data set for all the membrane traffic mutants from all 3 classes is shown in Table S3. CPY secretion was performed as previously described (Roberts et al., 1991). Briefly, cells were grown overnight in liquid YPAD medium, standardized to an OD600 of 1.0, serially diluted 10-fold, and spotted onto solid YPAD, YPAD with 500 mm KCl, and YPAD with 1 M sorbitol. Cells were allowed to grow for 24 hr, then a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH or Whatman, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) was laid over the cells and growth continued for another 24 hr. Membranes were washed with dH2O to remove remaining cells, then incubated for 30 min in PBS-T (9% NaCl, 0.14% KH2PO4, 0.42% NaHPO4, 0.02% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and 30 min in blocking buffer (5% Carnation instant milk in PBS-T) with gentle rocking at room temperature. Membranes were incubated in a 1:2000 dilution of mouse anti-CPY monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes/InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 hr with shaking at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times in blocking buffer and incubated in a 1:2000 dilution of rabbit anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare) for 1 hr. Membranes were washed three times in PBS-T and CPY antigen was visualized using ECL western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions using Kodak X-Omat AR film (Rochester, NY). Exposure time for visualization of luminescence was up to 10 min. As a control for lysis, parallel filters were subjected to similar analysis with an anti-phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK) antibody (Molecular Probes/InVitrogen). To examine localization of Trk1 in the various mutant strains, 100 ODs of cells previously transformed with pAM7904 (HA-tagged TRK1) were collected by centrifugation then washed once with breaking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 M sorbitol, 0.1 M NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2), then incubated for 1 hr on ice in 1 mL breaking buffer containing protease inhibitors (20 \xce\xbcg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 \xce\xbcg/mL antipain, 1 \xce\xbcg/mL leupeptin, 1 \xce\xbcg/mL pepstatin, and 10 \xce\xbcg/mL \xce\xb12-macroglobulin, all from Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 5 mm \xce\xb2-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm NaVO4, also all from Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were then transferred to 13 \xc3\x97 100 mm glass tubes containing the same volume of acid-washed glass beads. Samples were vortexed for 1 min four times, with 1 min on ice in between each vortexing. The glass tubes were spun briefly at low speed to pellet the glass beads, then lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Lysates were centrifuged first at 700 \xc3\x97 g, then at 1000 \xc3\x97 g to remove remaining beads and large debris. The cleared supernatants, with additional aliquots of protease and phosphatase inhibitors, were used either for differential centrifugation or for raft analysis. Previously, we found that in wild-type cells, Trk1 is pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 \xc3\x97 g, and that none is found in the 13,000 \xc3\x97 g supernatant fraction, consistent with plasma membrane localization of Trk1 (Munson et al., 2004a). Thus, we analyzed the distribution of Trk1 between the 13,000 \xc3\x97 g pellet and supernatant fractions. Analysis of incorporation of Trk1-HA into lipid microdomains (\xe2\x80\x9crafts\xe2\x80\x9d) was determined as previously described (Zeng et al., 2004). Cleared lysates were treated with an equal volume of cold 2% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 min. Pellet (containing the raft proteins) and supernatant fractions were obtained after centrifugation at 100,000 \xc3\x97 g for 1 hr at 4\xc2\xb0C. Pellets were resuspended in 1\xc3\x97 Laemmli sample buffer (Laemmli 1970) and supernatant samples were brought to 1\xc3\x97 by the addition of concentrated sample buffer. Samples were separated by gel electrophoresis on 4\xe2\x80\x9315% gradient gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) then transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot analysis with an anti-HA antibody (Covance, Princeton, NJ) was performed as previously described (Ausubel et al., 1997). As a control, samples were also blotted with the anti-PGK antibody (Molecular Probes/InVitrogen). The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) (http://www.yeastgenome.org; accessed between June and August 2010) was used to identify GO terms for process, function, and component. The GO Term Finder function (Boyle et al., 2004) using the default settings which includes noncoding genes was used to calculate P values describing enrichment of GO terms in the selected set of hygromycin B-sensitive mutants compared to the 7167 gene elements in the yeast genome. The significance cutoff is set to return P values < 0.01. A subset of the data from this analysis with the most significant hits is shown in Table 2; the complete GO analysis is documented in Table S2A, Table S2B, and Table S2C. Regulation of cytosolic K+ levels, controlled by the combined activities of influx, efflux, and sequestration, is not well understood despite the fact that K+ is the most abundant cation in cells. Processes that require K+ include protein synthesis (Ledbetter and Lubin, 1977, Lubin, 1967, Lubin and Ennis, 1964, Lubin 1964) and progression through the cell cycle (Sutton et al., 1991, Masuda et al., 2000). Endocytosis is also affected by intracellular K+ (Larkin et al., 1983, Larkin et al., 1986, Heuser and Anderson, 1989, Larkin et al., 1985, Vercauteren et al., 2010). In efforts to identify gene products that contribute to control of K+ levels, we screened the yeast knockout collection. Our rationale was as follows: Anecdotal reports in the literature suggest that sensitivity to toxic cations, including hygromycin B, is a characteristic of strains exhibiting alterations in K+ homeostasis. Examples include trk\xce\x94 mutants, lacking the K+ influx transporters, Trk1 and Trk2 (Madrid et al., 1998); hal\xce\x94 mutants, lacking the kinases Sat4/Hal4 and Hal5, which function upstream of the Trks (Mulet et al., 1999); calcineurin mutants, lacking an important phosphatase for regulation of intracellular levels of ions, including K+ (Withee et al., 1998); and pmp3\xce\x94 mutants, lacking a small proteolipid important for cellular responses to ions (Navarre and Goffeau 2000). Thus, we hypothesized that mutants sensitive to hygromycin B would likely have defects in K+ regulation. We identified potential K+ homeostasis mutants by screening the yeast homozygous diploid deletion collection, which represents about two-thirds of the genome and includes all nonessential genes, for sensitivity to hygromycin B. Although hygromycin B is a translation inhibitor (Brodersen et al., 2000), ribosomal protein genes are for the most part essential and so not present in this collection. In addition, although some glycosylation mutants are sensitive to hygromycin B (Sato et al., 1999, Dean, 1995, Van Berkel et al., 1999), such mutants are generally sensitive to much higher levels of hygromycin B than the levels we used here. Rather, it has been suggested hygromycin B at lower levels like those used for the screen is useful for identification of mutant strains with defects in stress tolerance (Banuelos et al., 2010, Dudley et al., 2005), including ion misregulation. Thus, it seemed reasonable to expect that many of the mutants identified by our screen would be involved in K+ homeostasis, rather than translation or glycosylation. The collection was initially screened to identify mutant strains that grew slowly in the presence of hygromycin B as described in Materials and Methods. Strains that passed the primary screen were rescreened to verify the hygromycin B-sensitive phenotype. A total of 166 mutants (\xe2\x88\xbc3.5% of the collection) were identified. As expected, few of the mutants obtained were deleted for genes involved in glycosylation or translation. Ten of the mutants had deletions of so-called \xe2\x80\x9cdubious\xe2\x80\x9d open-reading frames (ORFs) according to the SGD and were not analyzed further, although we noted that for the most part, these dubious genes overlapped authentic genes identified in the screen. The remaining 156 strains, as previously detailed in our studies on the arl1\xce\x94 mutant (Munson et al., 2004b), were also sensitive to tetramethylammonium chloride (data not shown), demonstrating a general sensitivity to toxic cations, rather than hygromycin B in particular. The mutants obtained were further subdivided by the ability of KCl in the growth medium to suppress hygromycin B sensitivity, since we previously noted that excess K+ could suppress the sensitivity of the arl1\xce\x94 strain (Munson et al., 2004a). Seventy-six of the 156 strains (49% of the sensitive mutants) grew well in hygromycin B-medium supplemented with 100 mm KCl. Twenty-three strains (15% of the sensitive mutants) grew in hygromycin B-medium supplemented with 500 mm KCl. Fifty-seven strains (36% of the sensitive mutants) did not achieve levels of growth seen in normal rich medium even with the inclusion of 500 mm KCl to hygromycin B-medium. These three groups were named class I, II, and III, respectively. Examples are shown in Figure 1. The ability of K+ to reverse the hygromycin B sensitivity of these strains was specific, since inclusion of an equal osmolar concentration of sorbitol was unable to suppress sensitivity to the drug (data not shown). The complete data sets from the screen are shown in Table S1A, Table S1B, and Table S1C. As an internal validation, we re-isolated the arl1\xce\x94 mutant in the screen, but in addition, isolated the trk1\xce\x94, sat4/hal4\xce\x94, hal5\xce\x94, and cnb1\xce\x94 strains; sensitivity of these strains was suppressed by 100 mm KCl, placing them in class I. (CNB1 encodes the regulatory subunit of calcineurin (Cyert et al., 1991). In contrast, the catalytic subunit of calcinuerin is encoded by one of two paralogs, CNA1 or CNA2 (Cyert et al., 1991), and one is sufficient to confer calcineurin activity on cells.) Finally, the pmp3\xce\x94 strain was isolated as well\xe2\x80\x94its sensitivity could not be suppressed by 500 mm KCl, making it a member of class III. Comparing our results to those previously obtained demonstrated that although the SGD (http://www.yeastgenome.org) lists 359 unique gene entries, we obtained only 156 hits. However, while we clearly did not obtain all the genes on the SGD list (121of 156 entries in our list are found on the SGD list, 77%), we did identify a number of genes that are not currently present on the SGD list (38 entries or 23% of our list). These identifications are noted in Table S2A\xe2\x80\x94upper case locus and gene names denote genes previously identified according to SGD (accessed August 2010), while lower case locus and gene names denote those newly identified by our screen. Some of the differences might be due to different strain backgrounds or differences in environmental conditions, including the source of hygromycin B, which we have found to vary from lot to lot. We organized the strains obtained from the screen by function of the deleted gene according to the gene ontology (GO) information from SGD (Table S2A). The most abundant group as a whole has deletions in genes previously shown to be important for regulation of membrane traffic (55 or 35% of the 156 strains). A similar percentage of genes on the SGD list of hygromycin B-sensitive strains are also membrane traffic regulators. Analysis of the GO terms by enrichment was performed for the entire set of 156 genes for process, function, and component terms (Table S2B) and for each of the genes found in the three classes for process terms only (Table S2C). The top 5 hits in terms of significance (as measured by P value) for each of these analyses is shown in Table 2. The major conclusion is that genes encoding regulators of membrane traffic are highly enriched in the collection of mutants isolated by our screen. Of the genes we identified, many have been shown to encode members of protein complexes. However, not all members of each complex were obtained in our screen. For example, the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes have important roles in sorting cargo into the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. All of the ESCRT-related strains obtained in the initial screen were members of class I, and we obtained at least one member from each of the complexes. It is possible that conditions in the screen were not sufficiently stringent to identify all members of each complex. This possibility seemed likely given that we failed to identify known hygromycin B-sensitive mutants according to SGD. Alternatively, it is possible that not all of these gene products are required for regulation of intracellular K+ content and therefore their loss does not confer a hygromycin B phenotype. We therefore specifically examined strains with deletions of genes known to encode MVB-pathway proteins not obtained in the initial screen. Our results demonstrated that several of the ESCRT mutants not obtained in the initial screen were sensitive to hygromycin B, including snf8\xce\x94/vps22\xce\x94 and vps25\xce\x94 (both members of ESCRT-II), vps28\xce\x94 (ESCRT-I), and snf7\xce\x94/vps32\xce\x94 (ESCRT-III), consistent with data from SGD. All of these mutants were suppressed by 100 mm KCl, placing them in class I. However, several mutants showed little sensitivity to hygromycin B at the levels tested (up to 0.1 mg/ml), including hse1\xce\x94 (ESCRT-0), srn2\xce\x94/vps37\xce\x94 (ESCRT-I), and strains missing genes encoding MVB accessory factors (doa4\xce\x94, rim13\xce\x94, or rim20\xce\x94). In accordance with our results, none of these genes are listed in the SGD list of gene mutations conferring a hygromycin B-sensitive phenotype. We also obtained members of other complexes involved in membrane traffic, but the phenotypes of the mutants within the complex were not always the same. First, we obtained the strains missing each of the four members of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP/VFT) complex, vps51\xce\x94, sac2\xce\x94/vps52\xce\x94, vps53\xce\x94, and luv1\xce\x94/vps54\xce\x94 previously reported to be sensitive to hygromycin B (Conboy and Cyert 2000). However, vps52\xce\x94 was a member of class II, while the other three strains were members of class III. Second, we obtained several strains missing a member of the class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) and the related homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complexes (Nickerson et al., 2009), including the vps3\xce\x94 (class II), vps8\xce\x94 (class I), pep5\xce\x94/vps11\xce\x94 (class I), vps16\xce\x94 (class III), vps33\xce\x94 (class III), and vps41\xce\x94 (class I) strains. We also obtained vps21\xce\x94 (class I), missing the gene for the Rab protein that associates with HOPS/CORVET complexes and mediates vesicle fusion (Gerrard et al., 2000, Horazdovsky et al., 1994), and vps9\xce\x94 (class I), missing the gene for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates Vps21 (Hama et al., 1999). We did not obtain the vps18\xce\x94 or vps39\xce\x94 strains, neither of which have been previously found to be sensitive to hygromycin B according to SGD. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that for the most part, loss of different subunits in a particular complex results in similar but not identical phenotypes with respect to hygromycin B-sensitivity and suppression by added K+. It has been suggested that changes in polarity of the plasma membrane may be responsible for hygromycin B sensitivity. Hyperpolarization thus leads to increased uptake of toxic cations, which can be reversed by the addition of an excess of a nontoxic cation, in this case K+. This hypothesis was put forward by Perlin and colleagues (Perlin et al., 1988, Perlin et al., 1989) with respect to their studies on the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, Pma1. This hypothesis could explain the hygromycin B-sensitive phenotype of the class I mutants, which have phenotypes similar to the trk1\xce\x94 mutant, since hygromycin B sensitivity was reversed by the addition of 100 mm K+. However, other work has shown that other mutants, such as kha1\xce\x94 mutants, exhibit normal polarity but nevertheless show hygromycin B sensitivity (Maresova et al., 2006). This fact is consistent with our class III mutants, where we found that a >250 molar excess of K+ was unable to suppress hygromycin B sensitivity. While our results thus far suggest that sensitivity to hygromycin B is a useful screening tool, we wanted to establish more directly that the mutants obtained by the screen were defective in K+ homeostasis. We therefore investigated the ability of the hygromycin B-sensitive strains to take up 86Rb+ relative to the parental wild-type strain. 86Rb+ has been used extensively to measure K+ fluxes in Saccharomyces (Madrid et al., 1998, Mulet et al., 1999, Banuelos and Rodriguez-Navarro 1998) and has been shown to be fully competitive with K+ (Armstrong and Rothstein 1967). For this analysis, we examined only the membrane traffic mutant strains obtained from the initial screen. Examples are shown in Figure 2 (for the complete list, as well as relative levels compared to wild-type, see Table S3). Most of the strains exhibited decreased 86Rb+ influx (<75% of wild-type levels), including 81% of class I membrane traffic mutants (25 of 30 strains), 92% of class II membrane traffic mutants (11 of 12 strains), and 60% of class III membrane traffic mutants (six of 10 strains te",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ted; four were not tested). Most of the remaining strains took up levels of 86Rb+ close to those exhibited by wild-type (considered to be those exhibiting 75\xe2\x80\x93125% of wild-type levels). Four strains exhibited more than 125% of wild-type uptake: rer1\xce\x94 (class I; 151% of wild-type); tlg2\xce\x94 (class III; 276% of wild-type); vps51\xce\x94 (class III; 372% of wild-type); and vps53\xce\x94 (class III; 142% of wild-type). In other work, we have found that some strains with increased K+ efflux take up higher levels of 86Rb+, presumably as a compensatory mechanism to maintain intracellular levels of K+ (Manlandro et al., 2005). To test this, these four strains were loaded with 86Rb+ for 60 min, then washed and resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm (cold) RbCl. Two strains, vps51\xce\x94 and vps53\xce\x94 (these genes encode members of the GARP/VFT complex), showed increased efflux compared to wild-type (2-threefold faster). The other two strains with increased uptake, rer1\xce\x94 and tlg2\xce\x94, exhibited efflux rates similar to wild-type (data not shown). Taken as a whole, the 86Rb+ uptake experiments demonstrate that while the hygromycin B-sensitive phenotype is a useful primary screen, it does not always correlate with decreased K+ (Rb+) uptake. In summary, as shown in Figure 2 and Table S3, the vast majority of the hygromycin B-sensitive membrane traffic mutants were defective for uptake of 86Rb+, a more specific test of K+ defects than hygromycin B sensitivity. Thus, the hygromycin B screen provided a valid approach to identify mutants with disturbances in K+ uptake compared to wild-type cells. As discussed above, loss of specific genes encoding membrane traffic regulators lead to decreased influx of K+ in most cases. We hypothesized that these strains could be defective for delivery and/or retention of the major K+ transporter, Trk1, at the plasma membrane because of the membrane traffic defects, although our previous studies demonstrated that this was not the case for the arl1\xce\x94 mutant (Munson et al., 2004a). We confined the next set of studies to 29 of the 30 membrane traffic mutants from class I, since the hygromycin B sensitive phenotype of these strains, like that of the trk1\xce\x94 and arl1\xce\x94 strains, can be suppressed by 100 mm KCl. One of these 29 strains, rer1\xce\x94, had increased influx and WT efflux of K+ (86Rb+); five strains (cog6\xce\x94, gga1\xce\x94, gga2\xce\x94, pep5\xce\x94, and vps27\xce\x94) had influx rates similar to wild-type; but the remaining 23 strains had influx rates less than wild-type. We first asked whether overexpression of Trk1, the major K+ influx transporter, suppressed the hygromycin B-sensitive phenotype of these strains. The strains were transformed with either a high copy empty vector (YEp352) or plasmid pAM7904, bearing an HA-tagged allele of TRK1 in the same vector. The tagged allele was functional because it complemented the hygromycin B-sensitive phenotype of the trk1\xce\x94 strain. Transformants were selected on medium lacking uracil then tested on YPAD medium with or without the addition of hygromycin B. However, none of the mutants grew better on medium containing hygromycin B when transformed with TRK1-HA compared to empty vector. Therefore, simply expressing higher levels of Trk1 was not sufficient to abrogate the hygromycin B-sensitive phenotype in any of the strains. To determine which genes were responsible for stability and/or localization of Trk1, we examined Trk1-HA in the class I membrane traffic mutants. In the first set of experiments, lysates were prepared, separated by electrophoresis, blotted to nitrocellulose, then probed with an anti-HA antibody to determine relative levels of Trk1. Two of the 29 showed no Trk1-HA: bro1\xce\x94 and ric1\xce\x94. An example is shown in Figure 3; data are summarized in Table 3, column 5. Bro1 is an accessory factor for the MVB pathway (Springael et al., 2002). It is interesting to note that loss of RIC1 has a different phenotype compared to loss of RGP1 with respect to steady state levels of Trk1, despite the fact their gene products work together as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ypt6 (Siniossoglou et al., 2000). In addition, in the bro1\xce\x94 and ric1\xce\x94 strains, although unable to detect the tagged version of Trk1 by western blot analysis, we nevertheless detected some 86Rb+ uptake, especially in the ric1\xce\x94 strain, suggesting that the cells may respond by up-regulating other means of K+ uptake (i.e., Trk2 or less specific monovalent cation influx transporters), although we cannot rule out the possibility that the native untagged allele is expressed. Steady state levels of Trk1-HA in representative membrane traffic mutant strains. Wild-type (BY4743) and mutant strains were transformed with a 2 \xce\xbc plasmid containing TRK1-HA. Cells were grown, then lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis with an anti-HA primary antibody followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary as described in Materials and Methods. Equal numbers of cells were prepared for each sample. The majority of strains tested showed levels of Trk1-HA similar to that of wild-type. Here we show one strain, glo3\xce\x94, which overexpresses Trk1-HA, and one strain, ric1\xce\x94, which lacks expression of Trk1-HA. Each of the 29 transformed class I membrane traffic mutant strains was tested at least twice, and the data are summarized in Table 3. Two other mutant strains showed increased levels of Trk1-HA, including glo3\xce\x94 and vps27\xce\x94 (an example is shown in Figure 3; data are summarized in Table 3, column 5). Glo3 is an Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Poon et al.,1999, Szafer et al., 2001) and Vps27 is a member of the ESCRT-0 complex (Bilodeau et al.,2002, Bilodeau et al.,2003, Katzmann et al., 2003). For the strains which show differences in the steady state levels of Trk1-HA, we have not explored whether this occurs as a result of different rates of synthesis or degradation of the protein. Importantly, however, the remaining 25 strains had levels of Trk1-HA equivalent to that observed in the wild-type parent. We next determined whether the Trk1-HA in each of the mutant strains was localized correctly to the plasma membrane. Lysates were prepared and subjected to subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation. Plasma membrane and vacuole fractions pellet at 13,000 \xc3\x97 g (P13), while internal membranes (Golgi and endosomes) are present in the supernatant (S13), which would then pellet at 100,000 \xc3\x97 g (P100) (Gaynor et al., 1998). Since Trk1 is an integral membrane protein with eight membrane passes (Durell et al.,1999, Durell and Guy 1999), we reasoned that determination of the fraction in P13 relative to S13 was sufficient to determine delivery of the Trk1-HA to the plasma membrane. Moreover, we previously showed that a myc-tagged allele of Trk1 was found in the P13 fraction, not in the P100 or S100 fraction in wild-type or arl1\xce\x94 cells (Munson et al., 2004a). Three strains \xe2\x80\x93 glo3\xce\x94, sec22\xce\x94, and vps41\xce\x94 \xe2\x80\x93 reproducibly exhibited a moderate fraction of Trk1-HA in the P13 supernatant fraction suggestive of localization to an internal membrane pool (an example is shown Figure 4; data are summarized in Table 3, column 6). Sec22 is an R-SNARE (Gaynor and Emr 1997), while Vps41 is a member of the HOPS complex (Radisky et al.,1997, Wurmser et al., 2000). In the remaining 26 strains, however, like wild-type, all of the Trk1-HA was found in the P13 fraction, consistent with correct localization to the plasma membrane. Subcellular fractionation analysis of representative strains. Wild-type (BY4743) and mutant strains transformed with 2 \xce\xbc plasmid containing TRK1-HA were grown, then lysed and prepared for subcellular fractionation analysis as described in Materials and Methods. The majority of strains tested showed all Trk1-HA in the P13 fraction as for wild-type shown here, consistent with plasma membrane localization. However, a few strains, including sec22\xce\x94, showed a portion of Trk1-HA in the S13 fraction, consistent with the notion that a portion of the protein was contained in an internal membrane pool. The small amount of PGK in the P fractions is due to incomplete removal of the supernatant in an effort to avoid disturbing the pellet. Each of the 29 class I transformed membrane traffic mutant strains was tested at least twice, and the data are summarized in Table 3. To examine localization of Trk1-HA to lipid microdomains, lysates were incubated with Triton-X 100 on ice for 30 min (Zeng et al., 2004). The lysates were then separated by centrifugation at 100,000 \xc3\x97 g into pellet (raft) and supernatant fractions. In wild-type cells, Trk1-HA is localized to the pellet fraction (Yenush et al., 2005) as confirmed here. However, in five of the mutants, cog6\xce\x94, glo3\xce\x94, sec22\xce\x94, vps23\xce\x94, and vps27\xce\x94, some Trk1-HA was localized to the supernatant fraction rather than the Triton-X 100 insoluble pellet (an example is shown in Figure 5; data are summarized in Table 3, column 7). However, in the remaining 24 strains, like wild-type, Trk1-HA was found only in the Triton-X 100 pellet, consistent with correct localization to lipid microdomains. Trk1-HA localization to lipid microdomains in representative strains. Wild-type (BY4743) and mutant strains transformed with 2 \xce\xbc plasmid containing TRK1-HA were grown and then were lysed, treated with Triton X-100, and prepared for raft analysis as described in Materials and Methods. T = total, S = supernatant from the 100,000 \xc3\x97 g spin (Triton-X soluble fraction), and P = pellet from the 100,000 \xc3\x97 g spin (the Triton-X insoluble fraction contains the lipid microdomains or rafts). The majority of strains tested localized Trk1-HA exclusively to the Triton-X 100 pellet as shown here for wild-type. However, a few strains, as shown here by cog6\xce\x94, did not localize Trk1-HA exclusively to the raft fraction. Each of the 29 transformed class I membrane traffic mutant strains was tested at least twice and the data are summarized in Table 3. Thus, in the majority of mutant strains examined (21 of 29), including the arl1\xce\x94 mutant as previously found (Munson et al., 2004a), neither steady-state level nor localization of Trk1-HA was significantly different from that seen in wild-type cells, and most of the remainder (six of eight) had relatively mild disruption of Trk1-HA location (i.e. where disruption was observed, the majority of the protein was nevertheless in the correct location). The major exceptions were the bro1\xce\x94/vps31\xce\x94 and ric1\xce\x94 strains, both of which had undetectable levels of Trk1-HA. Loss of intracellular K+ leads to inhibition of both clathrin-mediated (Larkin et al.,1986, Larkin et al.,1985, Larkin et al., 1983) and clathrin-independent endocytosis (Vercauteren et al., 2010). We asked whether increases in extracellular K+ could negate the effects of loss of certain gene products involved in membrane traffic. Specifically, we examined the membrane traffic mutants from all three classes identified in the original screen by asking whether growth on medium containing increased KCl suppressed the carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) secretion phenotype exhibited by these strains. Since addition of KCl to the medium affects not only K+ levels but also osmolarity, we compared the CPY secretion phenotype of the strains on regular medium with no additions, with added KCl, and with added sorbitol as an osmolarity control. Of the strains tested (see Figure 6 for representative data and Table S4 for the complete data set), the CPY secretion phenotype of 10 strains was suppressed well by KCl but not by sorbitol. These are did4\xce\x94/vps2\xce\x94 (class I), pep7\xce\x94/vps19\xce\x94 (class II), pep12\xce\x94/vps6\xce\x94 (class II), vps1\xce\x94 (class II), vps3\xce\x94 (class II), vps4\xce\x94 (class I), vps8\xce\x94 (class I), vps9\xce\x94 (class I), vps24\xce\x94 (class I), and vps27\xce\x94 (class I). These results are consistent with a model that some of these gene products may play structural roles in the complexes in which they function, while others are important for the catalytic function, and loss of the structural proteins can be suppressed in part by increasing the K+ content of cells. Effects of K+ on CPY secretion in selected membrane traffic mutants. CPY secretion was measured in the presence and absence of 500 mm KCl or 1M sorbitol. Sorbitol served as an osmolarity control, used to test whether K+ specifically or increased osmolarity in general affected CPY secretion. We found that in 28 of 56 strains tested, both K+ and sorbitol suppressed secretion. In 10 strains, only K+ suppressed CPY secretion (as shown in the vps9\xce\x94 strain, for example). In 18 strains, neither K+ nor sorbitol affected CPY secretion. For the complete data set, see Table S4. The same initial screen also identified three mutants lacking genes encoding inositol (kcs1\xce\x94 and arg82\xce\x94) and phosphatidylinositol (fab1\xce\x94) kinases, all of which have been implicated in proper vacuolar function and morphology (Cooke et al.,1998, Dubois et al.,2002, El Alami et al.,2003, Yamamoto et al.,1995, Zhang et al., 2001). Loss of any of these genes resulted in hygromycin B-sensitivity that was suppressed by KCl but not equiosmolar sorbitol (Figure 7A), and all three mutants exhibited decreased Rb+ uptake relative to wild-type (data not shown). Transforming the plasmid containing the Trk1-HA allele into these strains and examining the expression of Trk1-HA revealed that it is expressed at lower levels in the fab1\xe2\x88\x86 and kcs1\xe2\x88\x86 mutants, and is not expressed at all in the arg82\xe2\x88\x86 mutant (Figure 7B), in sharp contrast to the results from the majority of the membrane traffic mutants where for the most part, Trk1-HA levels were unaffected. This suggests that the function of these three gene products, possibly through their effects on vacuolar function, is important in the regulation of Trk1\xe2\x80\x99s steady state protein levels. However, Arg82 is also involved in the regulation of arginine biosynthesis by interacting with and preventing the degradation of the transcription factors Arg80 and Mcm1 (El Alami et al., 2003), and this function is separate from its involvement in vacuolar function and morphology (El Alami et al.,2003, Dubois et al., 2002). Therefore, further investigation is required to elucidate the functions of these proteins on Trk1 expression and activity. Inositol kinases are involved in the modulation of Trk1 steady state protein levels. (A) Wild-type (BY4743), trk1\xe2\x88\x86, arg82\xe2\x88\x86, fab1\xe2\x88\x86, and kcs1\xe2\x88\x86 strains were grown in rich medium, then diluted to a concentration of 1 OD/mL. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the cells were spotted onto media containing HB, HB + KCl, and HB + sorbitol at the above listed concentrations, and the plates were incubated for 3 days at 30\xc2\xb0C and then photographed. (B) Wild type, arg82\xe2\x88\x86, fab1\xe2\x88\x86, and kcs1\xe2\x88\x86 strains were transformed with a 2 \xc2\xb5 plasmid bearing Trk1-HA. Protein lysates were prepared from these transformed strains, and the total lysate was separated by gel electrophoresis as described in Materials and Methods and subjected to Western blotting with the anti-HA antibody. Pgk1 is shown as a loading control. Our results show that the K+ influx defects observed are unlinked to steady state level of localization of Trk1-HA in most strains lacking a membrane traffic regulator. In order to explain these results, we have come up with two alternative models that will form the basis of future experiments. The first is the direct model: the modulators of Trk1 activity are aberrantly trafficked as a result of loss of membrane traffic regulators. This model is consistent with the observation that in most cases, wild-type amounts of Trk1-HA are present at the plasma membrane and in the correct lipid subdomain, but nevertheless, show decreased 86Rb+ uptake. As mentioned previously, positive and negative regulators of Trk1 have been identified: the Hal kinases (Mulet et al.,1999, P\xc3\xa9rez-Valle et al., 2007) and Ppz phosphatases (Posas et al.,1995, Ruiz et al., 2004b, Yenush et al.,2005, Yenush et al., 2002), respectively. If the direct model is valid, then either the positive regulators are unable to reach Trk1 or the negative regulators are unable to leave the site where Trk1 is present when membrane traffic is disrupted. This model is consistent with our observation that overexpression of Trk1 does not suppress the hygromycin B-sensitive phenotype. In further support, Ppz1 is localized to the plasma membrane and interacts with Trk1 at that site (Yenush et al.,2005, Yenush et al., 2002), a result confirmed by GFP tagging (Huh et al., 2003). Thus, Ppz1 (and perhaps Ppz2) may be trapped at the plasma membrane in the membrane traffic mutants. The second model, the indirect model, builds upon the observation that control of cytosolic vs. lumenal pH and K+ are important for control of membrane traffic (Brett et al., 2005). In this model, Trk1 activity could be indirectly down-regulated, because the ionic conditions necessary for membrane traffic are not fulfilled. Important proteins in control of these processes include a variety of Na+-K+/H+ exchangers, including Kha1 (Maresova and Sychrova,2005, Maresova and Sychrova,2010, Ramirez et al., 1998), Nha1 (Banuelos et al.,2002, Banuelos et al.,1998, Prior et al.,1996, Sychrova et al., 1999), Nhx1/Vps44 (Bowers et al.,2000, Nass et al.,1997, Nass and Rao 1998), and Vnx1 (Cagnac et al.,2010, Cagnac et al., 2007). This model predicts that loss of membrane traffic proteins responsible for the localization or activity of one or more of these Na+-K+/H+ exchangers results in the phenotypes observed. In support of this model with respect to Nhx1, it was previously found that a gyp6\xce\x94 mutant is resistant to hygromycin B, overexpression of GYP6 confers hygromycin B sensitivity, and Gyp6 binds to Nhx1 as analyzed by two-hybrid studies (Ali et al., 2004). Gyp6 thus appears to be a negative regulator of Nhx1 activity, controlling the pH of vesicles (Ali et al., 2004). In addition, Gyp6 is the GTPase-activating protein for the monomeric G-protein, Ypt6 (Strom et al.,1993, Will and Gallwitz 2001), while Ric1 and Rgp1 together encode the guanine\xe2\x80\x93nucleotide exchange factor for Ypt6 (Siniossoglou et al., 2000). In our screen, we obtained the nhx1\xce\x94, ypt6\xce\x94, ric1\xce\x94, and rgp1\xce\x94 strains and all have decreased levels of 86Rb+ uptake. Interestingly, the ypt6\xce\x94, ric1\xce\x94, and rgp1\xce\x94 strains all fell into class I (sensitivity is suppressed by 100 mm KCl), but the nhx1\xce\x94 strain was a member of class III (its sensitivity cannot be suppressed by raising extracellular KCl). Preliminary data, however, suggest that simply overexpressing NHX1 in the 29 class I membrane traffic mutants was not sufficient to reverse the hygromycin B-sensitive phenotype (Steidel and Rosenwald, unpublished data). We will examine localization of Nhx1 and the other exchanges in these strains in the future. Additionally, we note that these two models may not be mutually exclusive, that the means of signaling from the exchangers to Trk1 may be via the Hal and/or Ppz proteins. In this study, because several mutants with defects in K+ homeostasis were previously shown to be sensitive to hygromycin B, we used this phenotype as a way to identify genes with potential roles in K+ homeostasis. Many of the hygromycin B-sensitive mutants were defective in membrane traffic, as others have previously described, but as we show here, the vast majority of these mutants were also defective in K+ uptake. However, for the majority of the mutants analyzed in detail, major changes in steady state level or localization of the major K+ importer, Trk1, were not observed, suggesting that Trk1 activity is down-regulated in these strains, although at present whether the effect seen is as a result of our direct or indirect models remains to be determined. In addition, we demonstrated that the CPY secretion phenotype of some strains could be suppressed specifically by the addition of additional KCl in the medium but not by an equal osmolar concentration of sorbitol. Finally, we showed that loss of three inositol kinases also affected K+ homeostasis, but in a way that is likely dependent on the control of steady state levels of Trk1. In summary, our work highlights a significant nexus between control of intracellular K+ levels and regulation of membrane traffic.

The original, and most commonly used, algorithm can only handle moderate numbers of partially informative markers. The advent of high-density genotyping with SNP chips motivates a new method because the generic sets of markers on SNP chips typically result in long stretches of partially informative markers. We validated a new method for inferring line origin, triM (tracing inheritance with Markov models), with simulated data. A realistic pattern of marker information was achieved by replicating the linkage disequilibrium from an existing chicken intercross. There were approximately 1500 SNP markers and 800 F2 individuals. The performance of triM was compared to GridQTL, which uses a variant of the original algorithm but modified for larger datasets. triM estimated the line origin with an average error of 2%, was 10% more accurate than GridQTL, considerably faster, and better at inferring positions of recombination. GridQTL could not analyze all simulated replicates and did not estimate line origin for around a third of individuals at many positions. The study shows that triM has computational benefits and improved estimation over available algorithms and is valuable for analyzing the large datasets that will be standard in future.Analysis of experimental line crosses using genetic markers has been successful in identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) for a wide range of physical, behavioral, and disease traits in plants, model organisms, and livestock species (Corva and Medrano 2001; Mackay 2001; Maloof 2003; Hocking 2005; Rothschild et al. 2007). Ultimate aims of QTL analyses include determining the number of genes influencing a trait and the nature and size of their effects, identification of important pathways in disease, and discovery of genes that may be useful in breeding programs. Resolving QTL to the level of the causative gene has been challenging, although there are some notable examples: IGF2 affecting muscle growth in pigs (Van Laere et al. 2003), ORFX for fruit size in tomatoes (Frary et al. 2000), and achaete-scute influencing bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster (Long et al. 2000). An obstacle to identifying the underlying genes has been the relatively large size of QTL regions, which can encompass hundreds of genes. For line crosses, ultimately the lower limit on the size of QTL regions is set by the number of recombinations that have occurred in the pedigree. However, to achieve the best resolution and statistical power within this constraint, it is important to extract the maximal possible information from the genetic markers. In linkage-based QTL analyses, such as with line crosses, marker genotypes are used to infer the inheritance of chromosomal segments through the pedigree. For line crosses, the key factor is the line origin of segments (i.e. whether they are inherited from a founder individual of line 1, or a founder individual of line 2). Most analyses apply interval mapping (Lander and Botstein 1989) where an association between line origin and phenotype is tested at regularly spaced positions along the genome. Many of these positions will not coincide with markers that unambiguously indicate the line origin (fully informative markers), in which case the probability of having each line origin is estimated based on the genotypes of available markers and the expected frequency of recombination between these markers and the test position. With inbred lines, all selected markers are fully informative, and only the genotypes of the two markers flanking the test position are needed. For outbred lines, however, many markers are likely to be only partially informative (more than one line origin is compatible with the genotype although at least one line origin can be excluded) because the same marker alleles are segregating in both lines. Haley et al. (1994) showed that for outbred lines, the genotypes of all partially informative markers up to the nearest fully informative marker on each side should be considered. They proposed an algorithm that separately evaluates the probability of each possible combination of line origins between fully informative markers, then sums and normalizes the results. To date, this algorithm, or variants of it, has been the most commonly used method for estimating line origin probabilities in outbred line crosses. The use of SNPs has become standard in QTL mapping, and because of their high frequency in the genome, the number of scored markers has increased considerably from older technologies. A recent advance is the SNP chip, which allows parallel genotyping of hundreds of thousands of selected SNPs. These SNPs are typically chosen from a few populations of interest. As a result, some will not be fully informative in studies involving other populations. However, because so many SNPs are included, there will still be many that are at least partially informative. The advantage of the chips is that they remove the need for time-consuming development, selection, and testing of markers for each study and provide a standard set of markers with known location, allowing direct comparisons between studies. Chips of at least 50,000 SNPs are currently available for cow, pig, dog, chicken, sheep, mouse, and maize, for example. The Haley et al. (1994) algorithm worked well for the small numbers of markers that were used at the time. However, the maximum number of calculations required by the algorithm scales exponentially with the number of partially informative markers in stretches with no intervening fully informative markers. On most computers, the algorithm crashes when there are more than 20 partially informative markers in such stretches (Nettelblad et al. 2009). Therefore, it is not suitable for handling SNP chip datasets. To utilize all the information available from SNP chips, a new method is needed. We recently developed a new tool for estimating line origin probabilities. The algorithm scales logarithmically with the number of markers included, making analysis of very large datasets feasible. We have designated this method triM (tracing inheritance with Markov models), which is implemented in the existing codebase cnF2freq (Nettelblad et al. 2009). Here we evaluate the performance of triM on simulated datasets of approximately 1500 SNPs of mixed information content. Although the original Haley et al. (1994) algorithm cannot deal with such datasets, they can be analyzed if the algorithm is modified to include information from only a subset of markers. We compare the behavior of triM to one such modified version of the Haley et al. (1994) algorithm incorporated in the web-based tool GridQTL (Seaton et al. 2006). The size of these datasets is at the reported upper limit for GridQTL, but we emphasize that triM can easily analyze much larger datasets than this.'","b'Estimating the line origin of chromosomal sections from marker genotypes is a vital step in quantitative trait loci analyses of outbred line crosses.

The size of these datasets is at the reported upper limit for GridQTL, but we emphasize that triM can easily analyze much larger datasets than this. triM employs an algorithm developed for hidden Markov models (Rabiner 1989). Using these models to track the parental origin of alleles in linkage mapping was introduced by Lander and Green (1987). Specific application of hidden Markov models to QTL analysis in intercrosses was implemented in R/QTL (Broman et al. 2003) but limited to the cases of inbred or haplotyped data. The underlying genetic model assumed by triM is the same as for the Haley et al. (1994) algorithm, but the advance in triM is full exploitation of the Markov property. Results from triM are expected to be identical to those that would be obtained from the Haley et al. (1994) algorithm, were the calculations possible. A Markov model consists of a series of states where the state at any point depends only on the immediately preceding state and not any of the states before that. Line origin along a chromosome is a Markov process if the frequencies of recombination in each interval are independent of each other. triM therefore applies Haldane\xe2\x80\x99s mapping function, which fulfills the Markov property by assuming no interference between crossovers. The extension to a hidden Markov model is that the states themselves are not observable but influence the values of a second variable, which is observed. In this context, the state is the line origin and the output variable is the marker genotype. The line origin probability at a test position is calculated by iteratively building up the probability of each line origin at successive marker positions, working forward and backward from both ends of the chromosome. For each marker position, only the probabilities of moving from the possible line origins at the preceding marker are needed; all the previous transition probabilities are contained in the line origin probabilities at the preceding marker. The calculation therefore collapses back to a limited number of operations at each marker, which is the basis of its efficiency. The forward and backward probabilities for each test position are multiplied together and normalized by the product summed over all origins. The principle of the algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1, and additional details are given in Nettelblad et al. (2009). triM is available for download at http://www.computationalgenetics.se under \xe2\x80\x9cSoftware.\xe2\x80\x9d We are currently developing a software package in the statistical environment R, incorporating triM, that will perform the complete process of QTL analysis for crosses between outbred lines. Outline of the forward-backward algorithm used in triM. (A) Schematic of line origin states along a section of chromosome flanked by two fully informative markers. Positions 1-5 are markers, and t is the position being tested as a QTL. Circles represent the possible line origins, where i,j symbolizes that the maternal haplotype originates from line i and the paternal haplotype from line j. Black filled circles show line origins that are compatible with the marker genotypes and pedigree. At t, all line origins are treated as compatible, shown by the gray filled circles. (B) Calculation of , the combined probability of having line origin i,j at position p and the observed marker genotypes from positions 1 to p, in the forward step. rp is the recombination frequency between position p and the next position. Only  and rp\xe2\x88\x921 are needed in each iteration. For clarity, calculations are only shown for one line origin. Although only compatible line origins are included in the example, triM considers incompatible origins with a low probability to allow for genotyping errors. (C) Calculation of , the probability of having the observed marker genotypes from position p +1 to the end, given that the line origin is i,j at position p, in the backward step. Only  and rp are needed in each iteration. Again, calculations are shown for only one line origin. Having obtained  and , the probability of line origin i,j at the test position is given by . (D) Representation of the number of operations needed for the forward-backward algorithm in this example. (E) For comparison, a representation of the number of operations required under the original algorithm for the same example. To evaluate triM with a realistic pattern of marker information, the simulation was based on data from a three-generation chicken intercross (Kerje et al. 2003) where dense SNP genotypes were available for two families (Groenen et al. 2009). These families originated from one Red Junglefowl male and three White Leghorn females and contained 23 and 25 F2 individuals, respectively. We simulated a single chromosome using the data from chromosome 1. Markers with missing genotypes in the parents or grandparents were removed. Some additional markers were also removed because of inheritance errors or uncertainty in their order, and a small number of genotype corrections were made, leaving a total of 1508 markers covering 451 cM. Genetic positions of markers were taken from the sex-averaged consensus linkage map (Groenen et al. 2009) where possible. The linkage positions were not used in a few cases where the order of one or two markers differed between the linkage map and the genome assembly. Remaining genetic positions were estimated from the nearest flanking markers in the linkage map, assuming a linear relationship between genetic and physical positions over the interval. Markers that had the same genetic position x were separated by spacing them evenly from x-0.05 to x+0.049 cM. The average distance between markers was 0.3 cM. The biggest gap between markers was 8 cM, between the second and third, and the third and fourth markers. There were 28 gaps of 1-4 cM; the remaining distances between markers were less than 1 cM. The pattern of marker information in an F2 individual depends on both the genotypes of the grandparents and how often successive markers that are heterozygous in a grandparent or parent, are heterozygous in their offspring. Essentially, it is determined by which alleles occur together on the same copy of a chromosome (the haplotypes) in the grandparents. It was not possible to unambiguously haplotype the grandparents because they had too few genotyped offspring. Therefore, we instead haplotyped the parents, and treated the haplotype transmitted to the parent as one haplotype in the grandparent, with the remaining alleles forming the second haplotype. When there were several parents that could be haplotyped for a given grandparent, one was chosen at random. Haplotyping was performed by the following procedure. First the allele originating from each parent was determined for the straightforward cases of markers that were homozygous or heterozygous with at least one parent homozygous. For the other heterozygous markers, the parental origin was inferred by looking at the combination of F2 genotypes at the marker and a second heterozygous marker where the origin was known. The second marker was chosen so that the set of F2 genotypes would differ according to which alleles were inherited together from the same parent. Genotypes of parents and then F2 individuals were simulated from the grandparent haplotypes. The number of crossovers was sampled from a Poisson distribution with mean equal to the chromosome length in Morgans. The positions of each crossover were then sampled from a uniform distribution covering the length of the chromosome. A starting haplotype was chosen at random. Moving along the chromosome, alleles were taken from this haplotype until a recombination position was reached. Then alleles were taken from the second haplotype. This continued, with the sampled haplotype changing after each crossover, to the end of the chromosome. Individuals were generated using the pedigree structure of the original three-generation intercross (Kerje et al. 2003). There were four male and 37 female parents and 773 F2 individuals. Line origin probabilities were estimated at 1-cM intervals. Both methods estimate four probabilities for each F2 individual and position, the product of two possible line origins for each haplotype. triM was used to obtain probabilities for 1000 replicates of the complete dataset. Attempts were then made to analyze the data using GridQTL, version 1.4.1. We were unable to obtain results from GridQTL for several tested replicates although the online documentation stated that GridQTL could handle around this number of markers. Therefore, we experimented with datasets of reduced size, produced by successively removing the last 100 markers. With 1200 markers, GridQTL produced results for nine of the first 10 replicates. Because of the difficulties in obtaining results from GridQTL, we compared triM and GridQTL for these nine replicates. To avoid possible artifacts at the end of the chromosome, as triM estimates were based on all 1508 markers, we compared only the region covered by 1150 markers, excluding the last 50 markers available to GridQTL, which was 333 cM. For many individuals, there were regions where GridQTL reported all line origin probabilities as zero (i.e. where probability estimates were missing). Even though these are the cases that have the largest impact on the power and precision for subsequent QTL analyses, we have not included these probabilities in our comparison. Only data points for which there were estimates from both GridQTL and triM were compared. Both methods were timed. For GridQTL, timing estimates were less accurate, because the viewer window in GridQTL had to be manually refreshed to check if an analysis had finished. The following two aspects of the results were considered. From the probabilities estimated by each method, we calculated the overall probabilities that each haplotype originates from line 1. The probabilities given by triM are, in order, (i) both haplotypes originate from line 1, (ii) the maternal haplotype originates from line 1 and the paternal haplotype from line 2, (iii) the maternal haplotype originates from line 2 and the paternal haplotype from line 1, and (iv) both haplotypes originate from line 2. In the results from GridQTL, the order of probabilities (ii) and (iii) are switched. Probabilities (i) and (ii) were summed for the maternal haplotype, and (i) and (iii) were summed for the paternal haplotype. The true line origins are specified in the simulation. For each haplotype, we define the line origin error at position i, , as,,where  is the probability of line 1 origin at position i. The average and standard deviation in line origin error was calculated over both haplotypes for all individuals. Inferred recombination events in the parents can be seen as changes in haplotype line origin probabilities from close to zero to nearly one and vice versa. Only such switches that covered the range of probabilities from 0.025-0.975 were considered; the positions where the probabilities exceeded 0.975 and fell below 0.025 were called the end points of the switch. Switches from GridQTL were not included if there were missing probability estimates within the switch. We defined two summary measures: imprecision and inaccuracy. Imprecision in an estimated recombination position is the distance between the end points of a switch. It quantifies the amount of uncertainty in the estimated position; high imprecision means the method locates a broad region in which recombination has occurred, low imprecision that an interval or short stretch has been pinpointed. Inaccuracy in an estimated recombination position is the distance between the true recombination position and where the line origin probabilities cross 0.5. Occasionally, several consecutive positions had a probability of 0.5; in these cases, the distance to the central position was used. The minimum possible imprecision is 1 cM; the minimum inaccuracy is 0 cM. Most of the largest line origin errors are likely to be where recombination positions have been estimated with high imprecision or inaccuracy. The average line origin error for triM over 1000 simulation replicates ranged from 0.0009 to 0.04 for most of the simulated chromosome (Figure 2A). The error was higher at the start of the chromosome, where the distance between the markers was largest, reaching an average of 0.12 at 12 cM. This position is halfway between one of the pairs of markers that are separated by 8 cM, with the second marker being homozygous for the same allele in all four grandparents, and the low marker information limits how accurately line origin can be estimated. The average line origin error across all positions was 0.017. The actual haplotype line origin corresponds to a probability of either 1 or 0; therefore, the average error is 2% of the range of possible values. The average standard deviation in line origin error within a replicate was 0.08 (Figure 2B). As with the average error, the average standard deviation in the error was higher at the start of the chromosome. Line origin error for triM. (A) Average line origin error at each position over both haplotypes and all individuals. Dots show the average for 1000 simulation replicates, and gray bars indicate the minimum and maximum average line origin error obtained for a single replicate. (B) Standard deviation in line origin error at each position. Dots show the average standard deviation for 1000 simulation replicates, and gray bars indicate the minimum and maximum standard deviations obtained for a single replicate. GridQTL had a higher average line origin error over nine replicates than triM at all positions (Figure 3). The difference varied from 0.00001 to 0.007, with an average across all positions of 0.0019. This is equivalent to a 10% higher average error for GridQTL than triM. Average difference in line origin error at each position between GridQTL and triM. Only values from triM that were also estimated by GridQTL are included. The end of the chromosome was excluded to avoid artifacts due to the additional marker information used by triM. Positive values mean that the average line origin error was higher for GridQTL than triM; dashed line indicates zero. Dots show averages for nine replicates. Gray bars indicate the minimum and maximum difference in line origin error obtained for a single replicate. The percentage of individuals missing probability estimates from GridQTL at each position is shown in Figure 4. It was between 15 and 52%, with an average over all positions of 35%. For every replicate, over 30% of individuals had missing probabilities in at least 2/3 of the positions. Missing probability values at each position from GridQTL. The percentage of individuals given zero probabilities for all four line origins is shown. Dots show the average for nine replicates. Gray bars indicate the minimum and maximum percentage of individuals with missing values for a single replicate. The analysis times for triM and GridQTL are shown in Table 1. triM completed each analyses in seconds whereas GridQTL took several hours. Table 1 also shows the number of replicates that GridQTL was able to analyze for different numbers of markers. In total, 46,520 recombinations were simulated over the first 333 cM in the nine simulations. We found switches in line origin probabilities for 88% of these using triM and 53% using GridQTL. Most of the recombination positions not found by GridQTL were in regions with missing probability estimates. GridQTL only identified 14 recombination events that were not found by triM. Imprecision in estimated recombination positions was nearly always higher for GridQTL than triM (Figure 5A), and inaccuracy was also higher on average for GridQTL (Figure 5B, Table 2). triM estimated more recombination positions with minimum imprecision than GridQTL and more with zero inaccuracy (Table 3). Estimation of recombination positions by triM and GridQTL. Imprecision and inaccuracy were measured as described in the METHODS. The size of the circles is in proportion to the number of data points at each pair of values. Points above the diagonal represent cases where imprecision or inaccuracy in the estimated position of recombination was greater for GridQTL than for triM; points below the diagonal, cases where imprecision or inaccuracy was greater for triM than GridQTL; and points on the diagonal, cases where imprecision or inaccuracy was the same for both methods. The further the points are from the diagonal, the bigger the difference between the results. (A) Imprecision in estimated positions of recombination. (B) Inaccuracy in estimated positions of recombination. Examples of cases where triM and GridQTL substantially differed in estimating recombination positions are given in Figure 6. In the few cases where the imprecision was much higher for triM than GridQTL, it was often when there were recombinations from line 1 to 2 in one parent and line 2 to 1 in the other, within a few cM, and although GridQTL was less imprecise in the estimate of one recombination, it failed to detect the other at all (Figure 6D). In contrast, cases where imprecision was much higher for GridQTL seemed to be when there were recombinations in the same direction in both parents (i.e. both line 1 to line 2 or vice versa), around 40 cM apart (Figure 6A and C). There were other times when the parental line origin probabilities estimated by GridQTL changed more slowly than the estimates from triM (Figure 6B). When inaccuracy was higher for triM than GridQTL by more than 2 cM, either imprecision was also higher for triM (Figure 6D), or triM was less imprecise, so that the number of surrounding positions with a high line origin error was lower for triM (Figure 6E). Cases where GridQTL estimates were much more inaccurate tended to be cases where they were also more imprecise (Figure 6C). Examples of haplotype line origin probabilities. Estimated probabilities that the paternal and maternal haplotypes originate from line 1 are illustrated for examples where there were large differences between triM and GridQTL in estimating recombination positions. The left two graphs show results from triM, and the right two graphs show results from GridQTL. The paternal haplotype is shown on the left, and the maternal haplotype is shown on the right. Dashed lines show the simulated line origins.

(E) One of the cases where triM was most inaccurate in estimating the recombination position in comparison to GridQTL; the simulated recombination position was at 210 cM in the father. Our study clearly illustrates the need for new algorithms to calculate line origin probabilities in outbred line cross experiments. The algorithm that is the basis of the most commonly used methods today (Haley et al., 1994) was not designed to handle dense SNP marker datasets and cannot be used for these in its original formulation. The GridQTL project (Seaton et al. 2006) provides a modified implementation of the Haley et al. (1994) algorithm that is reported to be useful for analyses of intermediate density SNP markers (up to 1500 markers per chromosome). Our comparisons however, illustrate that such extensions are not optimal, because for the GridQTL implementation (i) there are problems with the stability of the algorithm leading to either a significant portion of the analyses terminating before results are obtained or probabilities not being calculated for many individuals in large parts of the genome; (ii) the computational load, despite considerable computational resources, is approximately two orders of magnitude greater for intermediate size datasets and increases rapidly with the number of additional markers included in the analyses; and (iii) accuracy in estimates of line origin probabilities and inference of recombination positions is lower as a result of not using all the available genetic information. Although the stability of the algorithm might be resolved and it is possible that the time requirements could be somewhat improved, further development based on the Haley et al. (1994) algorithm is not recommended, as the algorithm is inherently less efficient than alternative algorithms and discarding marker information will inevitably give lower accuracy in estimates of line origin probabilities. This study involved datasets of 1200-1500 markers, which was close to the maximum that could be handled by the modified Haley et al. (1994) algorithm implemented in GridQTL. This is, however, much lower than the number of markers that can currently be genotyped with SNP chips, for example, the chicken 60K SNP chip has approximately 8600 markers on chromosome 1. triM will be able to use all the marker information in such large datasets and complete the analyses rapidly. A result that is of major concern for those attempting to analyze moderately dense SNP datasets with GridQTL is the large number of missing probability estimates; over 30% of the individuals had no estimates for the majority of the genome. Using GridQTL estimated probabilities rather than a complete set of probabilities to test for an association with phenotype will substantially reduce the power to detect QTL. Data were simulated to closely reflect the pattern of marker information in real intercrosses. This was achieved by using founder haplotypes that were as near as possible to those in a well-studied chicken intercross and replicating the marker distances and pedigree structure. Therefore, the linkage disequilibria observed should closely resemble those that can be seen in real data. A series of replicates were created to ensure that findings were not due to peculiarities in specific runs; results showed relatively little variation across replicates. Hence, we believe that the findings in this study are representative of other large datasets. triM was able to analyze the full set of markers and all replicates and give probability estimates for every position. Theoretically, the number of calculations performed by triM scales logarithmically with the number of markers, not exponentially as in the Haley et al. (1994) algorithm. This manageable increase in memory required means that triM should be capable of analyzing much larger marker datasets than those simulated here, including those that might become available in the future as SNP genotyping technology develops. There is no need for extensive preprocessing of the data; all the marker genotypes can be submitted so that no information is lost. In this study, triM was shown to be considerably faster than the modified Haley et al. (1994) algorithm implemented in GridQTL, taking seconds to complete the analyses rather than hours. The gain in speed was at least a factor of 80. The online documentation for GridQTL gives an estimated runtime of 48 hr for data from 1500 markers on one chromosome in 1000 individuals. As with memory, the time required by triM should increase moderately as more markers are included, so that data from large SNP chips could still be completed in a reasonable time. Our simulations show that the average line origin error is low, around 2%, for both methods. The error was 10% larger for the GridQTL algorithm than for triM. Although the difference is small in absolute terms, triM did perform better and therefore should be preferred. It should also be noted that the observed difference in accuracy probably underestimates the true difference between the methods because only values that were estimated by GridQTL were compared. The points that GridQTL failed to estimate presumably included those where there were the longest stretches of partially informative markers, and therefore where the difference between the two methods could be greatest. To gain a more detailed understanding of the differences between the two methods, we explored how well they inferred positions of recombination in the parents using measures of imprecision and inaccuracy. High imprecision or inaccuracy in estimating recombination positions is likely to explain most of the largest errors in line origin. GridQTL was nearly always more imprecise in estimating recombination positions than triM. There was less difference between the methods in the accuracy of the estimated positions, although GridQTL was more inaccurate than triM considerably more times than the other way round. There is no detailed documentation of the changes made to the Haley et al. (1994) algorithm in GridQTL. It is likely that it uses a similar algorithm to that of QTL Express, the predecessor of GridQTL, where partially informative markers were discarded if necessary, so that there were no more than 15 partially informative markers in a stretch without intervening fully informative markers. Although these details are not available, we do not feel this affects our conclusions, as the differences between GridQTL and triM are in line with theoretical expectations. We evaluated triM on a simulated F2 population. However, triM can equally be used for backcross populations or full or half sib family analyses.

emented, cnF2freq, has additional capabilities. First, the grandparental chromosome that a region originates from can be estimated. This information can be used for more general analyses in a variance component framework without assuming QTL are fixed for alternate alleles in the two lines (R\xc3\xb6nneg\xc3\xa5rd et al. 2008). The functionality can also be extended into a full scheme for haplotyping. Inferring parental haplotypes can provide additional information on line origin by considering inheritance at linked markers. Second, different recombination rates can be applied for the two sexes. Although we simulated the same recombination rate in both sexes, sex differences in recombination rates of autosomes have been found in chicken (Kerje et al. 2003, Groenen et al. 2009) and other species. Use of the appropriate recombination rates for each sex should improve the probability estimates in general and is essential for correct analysis of the sex chromosomes. When the physical location or ordering of markers is known, a maximum likelihood fit of sex-specific recombination rates can also be computed, where the sex-averaged distances can be used as a starting value. Third, joint line origin probabilities, required for fitting models of more than one locus per chromosome (for example, in testing for epistasis) can be estimated. The line origin probabilities at two such positions are not independent if there is no fully informative marker between them and these dependencies have been included. In conclusion, we have validated that triM provides accurate line origin probabilities from large SNP datasets and is extremely fast. A variant of the Haley et al. (1994) algorithm that has most commonly been used for this purpose was shown to be inferior for such data. triM was faster, more stable, provided more accurate line origin probabilities, and was better at inferring recombination positions. triM is therefore recommended as the method of choice for estimating line origin probabilities in outbred line crosses. triM is under continued development, and several useful additional functionalities are already available that will enable QTL analyses to keep pace with advances in genotyping technology. \xc3\x96.C. acknowledges funding from The Swedish Foundation for Strategic research and a EURYI Award from ESF.

Weller', 'Micha Ron']","June 1, 2011.",Fine Mapping of a QTL for Fertility on BTA7 and Its Association With a CNV in the Israeli Holsteins,"b'A quantitative trait locus (QTL) affecting female fertility, scored as the inverse of the number of inseminations to conception, on Bos taurus chromosome 7 was detected by a daughter design analysis of the Israeli Holstein population (P < 0.0003). Sires of five of the 10 families analyzed were heterozygous for the QTL. The 95% confidence interval of the QTL spans 27 cM from the centromere. Seven hundred and four SNP markers on the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip within the QTL confidence interval were tested for concordance. A single SNP, NGS-58779, was heterozygous for all the five QTL heterozygous patriarchs, and homozygous for the remaining five QTL homozygous sires. A significant effect on fertility was associated with this marker in the sample of 900 sires genotyped (P < 10\xe2\x88\x926). Haplotype phase was the same for four of the five segregating sires. Thus concordance was obtained in nine of the ten families. We identified a common haplotype region associated with the rare and economically favorable allele of the SNP, spanning 270 kbp on BTA7 upstream to 4.72 Mbp. Eleven genes found in the common haplotype region should be considered as positional candidates for the identification of the causative quantitative trait nucleotide. Copy number variation was found in one of these genes, KIAA1683. Four gene variants were identified, but only the number of copies of a specific variant (V1) was significantly associated with breeding values of sires for fertility.Poor reproductive performance is one of the most common reasons for premature culling. Low female fertility causes economic losses by increasing the need for additional inseminations, higher veterinary costs, longer than optimal lactations, less calves, and higher replacement costs. Therefore, improving female fertility is important for dairy cattle breeders. Various statistics are used to measure fertility of dairy cattle in different countries. In Israel, fertility is scored as the inversed number of inseminations to conception. Heritability for nearly all measures of fertility is only 1\xe2\x80\x935% (Gonzalez-Recio et al. 2006; Kuhn et al. 2006; Weller and Ezra 1997), and has negative genetic correlations with milk production traits (Gonzalez-Recio et al. 2006; Veerkamp et al. 2001; Weller and Ezra 1997). Weller et al. (2008) conducted a daughter design QTL scan for economic traits on BTA7 in Israeli Holstein population. The scan included genotyping 29 microsatellites spanning the chromosome in 11 sires families. Two significant effects for female fertility QTL were identified; near the centromere with five segregating sire families, and near the end of the chromosome with two segregating sire families. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the QTL near the centromere spans 27 cM, which includes hundreds of genes. The most convincing methodology for identifying the causative polymorphism for segregating QTL, the quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN), is concordance (Ron and Weller 2007). Complete concordance is obtained only if: Testing for concordance requires determination of the QTL genotype of several individuals, which can be determined for family patriarchs by either a daughter or granddaughter design (Ron and Weller 2007). The first two requirements for concordance can be analyzed directly from daughter or granddaughter designs results. The third requirement for concordance requires the identification of the QTL phase of the segregating sires. Concordance can be considered as a proof for QTN detection if the probability of obtaining concordance by chance is sufficiently low for rejection of this hypothesis (Ron and Weller 2007). For a given number of patriarchs with known QTL genotype, probability of obtaining concordance by chance decreases as the fraction of heterozygous sires increases (Weller et al. 2008). Therefore, we focused the analysis on the QTL near the centromeric region of BTA7, because five sires were heterozygous for this QTL. Recently, 900 Israeli Holstein sires with genetic evaluations for milk production traits and female fertility, including the 10 patriarchs of the daughter design, were genotyped for the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip, which includes 54,001 SNPs. The aim of this study was to identify SNPs with significant concordance within the CI of the female fertility QTL in the centromeric region of BTA7, and to use this data to identify likely candidate genes for the QTL.'","b""A quantitative trait locus (QTL) affecting female fertility, scored as the inverse of the number of inseminations to conception, on Bos taurus chromosome 7 was detected by a daughter design analysis of the Israeli Holstein population (P < 0.0003).

The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the QTL near the centromere spans 27 cM, which includes hundreds of genes. The most convincing methodology for identifying the causative polymorphism for segregating QTL, the quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN), is concordance (Ron and Weller 2007). Complete concordance is obtained only if: 1. All individuals known to be homozygous for the QTL are also homozygous for the polymorphism. 2. All individuals heterozygous for the QTL are also heterozygous for the polymorphism. 3. The same QTL allele is associated with the same allele of the putative QTN for all the heterozygous animals. Testing for concordance requires determination of the QTL genotype of several individuals, which can be determined for family patriarchs by either a daughter or granddaughter design (Ron and Weller 2007). The first two requirements for concordance can be analyzed directly from daughter or granddaughter designs results. The third requirement for concordance requires the identification of the QTL phase of the segregating sires. Concordance can be considered as a proof for QTN detection if the probability of obtaining concordance by chance is sufficiently low for rejection of this hypothesis (Ron and Weller 2007). For a given number of patriarchs with known QTL genotype, probability of obtaining concordance by chance decreases as the fraction of heterozygous sires increases (Weller et al. 2008). Therefore, we focused the analysis on the QTL near the centromeric region of BTA7, because five sires were heterozygous for this QTL. Recently, 900 Israeli Holstein sires with genetic evaluations for milk production traits and female fertility, including the 10 patriarchs of the daughter design, were genotyped for the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip, which includes 54,001 SNPs. The aim of this study was to identify SNPs with significant concordance within the CI of the female fertility QTL in the centromeric region of BTA7, and to use this data to identify likely candidate genes for the QTL. DNA samples of 900 Israeli Holstein bulls were genotyped for 54,001 SNPs using the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. Quality control and genotyping procedure are as shown by Weller et al. (2010). A total of 704 SNP markers included on the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip are positioned within the first 30 Mbp of BTA7, which cover the CI of the QTL for female fertility. The genotypes of the 704 SNPs for the 10 sires with inferred genotypes for the QTL from the daughter design were tested for concordance, of which five were heterozygous and five were homozygous for the QTL. The SNP marker that showed the highest fit to the concordance model is NGS-58779. All five sires, homozygous for the QTL, were homozygous for the marker and all five patriarchs, heterozygous for the QTL were heterozygous for the marker. Nevertheless, the haplotype phase was concordant for only four of the five segregating sires. Thus concordance was obtained in 9 out of the 10 families. The probability to obtain a genetic marker with similar concordance by chance was computed assuming that the QTL allele frequency is 0.5, as half of the families segregated for the QTL. Assuming independence among the sire genotypes, the probability by chance that the five sires homozygous for the QTL will also be homozygous for the marker is 0.55, the probability that four sires will be heterozygous for the marker and the QTL with correct allele phase between the QTL and the marker is: 0.254. The probability that one out of five heterozygous sires for the QTL will be heterozygous for the marker with incorrect allele phase between the QTL and the marker is: 0.25*5. Thus, the probability to obtain this level of concordance by chance for a single SNP is: 0.55* 0.254* 0.25*5 = 0.000152. As 704 SNPs were analyzed 0.1 SNP is expected to show this level of concordance by chance. Genotypes of 20 SNP markers from the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip, positioned within the flanking 0.5 Mbp upstream and downstream to NGS-58779, were analyzed for 900 Israeli Holstein sires. Haplotype phase analysis was performed using the Plink software with individuals treated as unrelated (Purcell et al. 2007). The resulting haplotypes of the 10 tested sires by the daughter design were verified by LSPH software that is based on known genetic relationships between individuals (Baruch et al. 2006). Comparative mapping between the bovine common haplotype region and the human orthologous region was conducted using Ensembl biomart (http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview) and NCBI map-viewer (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/mapview/). A partial screen of the exons of six of the 11 genes within the identified common haplotype region (KIAA1683, PDE4C, CIST1, JUND, LSM4, and GDF15) was performed in order to identify concordant polymorphism for the QTL. Primers were designed by the Primer3plus software (http://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/primer3plus/primer3plus.cgi) in accordance with the exon-intron borders obtained from the reference sequence of the NCBI Entrez Gene database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/). DNA of sires was extracted from semen samples as described previously (Ma et al. 1996). The bovine KIAA1683 genes (LOC618787 and LOC788637) were sequenced simultaneously, due to the very high similarity in their predicted exonic sequences. The primers that were used for the positional cloning are presented in Table 1. PCR fragments were amplified using Super-Therm Taq DNA polymerase (JMR Holding, London) according to the instructions of the manufacturer and the following conditions: 30 cycles for 30 s at 92\xc2\xb0C, 40 s at 63\xc2\xb0C, and 1 min at 72\xc2\xb0C, using a DNA engine thermocycler (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA). PCR products were separated on agarose gels, excised from the gel, purified with DNA Montage Gel Extraction Kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Sequencing was preformed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit using the 3130 Genetic Analyzer capillary electrophoresis instrument (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were assembled and compared using the GAP4 program (Staden et al. 1999). Specific primers (SP) were designed to PCR amplify separately each of the A/G alleles located in KIAA1683 at position 4856941 /4896528 bp on BTA7, which was heterozygous in all of the sires (Table 1). An \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cT\xe2\x80\x9d mismatch in the fifth nucleotide from the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the SP primers, indicated by lower case letter, was introduced to increase the specificity of the PCR amplification. Standard M-13 phage forward or reverse primer sequences were added to the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 core primer sequence to serve as a template for sequencing primers and to decrease primers dimer formation. An additional 26 repeats of T tail was attached to the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the SP1 primer to allow detection of fragment size difference from the SP2 PCR product on a 2% agarose gel. The KIAA1683_exon3_R primer was used as a reverse primer (Table 1). PCR products were amplified by high-fidelity BIO-X-ACT Long DNA polymerase (Bioline, London) according to the instructions of the manufacturer and the following conditions: 30 cycles for 30 s at 92\xc2\xb0C, 40 s at 64\xc2\xb0C, and 1 min at 72\xc2\xb0C, using a DNA engine thermocycler (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA). SP1 and SP2 PCR products were sequenced using the M-13_F and R primers, respectively. The sequences of the isolated variants of the KIAA1683 gene were Blasted against the bovine WGS traces and the HTGS sequence databases (NCBI) for sequence validation, and to identify alternative variants of the gene which were not found among the 10 sires. Determination of the relative copy number of the total KIAA1683 gene (including all gene variants) was conducted using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. A total of 326 Israeli Holstein bulls with known breeding values for fertility including the 10 sires that were tested by the daughter design were analyzed. Primers were designed on a region of the exon 3 which was common and monomorphic to all of the identified gene variants. Relative copy numbers of V1, V2, and V3 were determined using variant specific selective primers. V1 selective primer was designed to amplify the \xe2\x80\x9cT\xe2\x80\x9d allele of the 4857096/4896683 polymorphism, which is unique for V1. V2 selective primer was designed to amplify the unique \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d allele of the 4857153/4896740 polymorphism, and the V3 selective primer was designed to amplify the unique \xe2\x80\x9cT\xe2\x80\x9d allele of the 4857126/4896713 polymorphism. M-13 phage forward standard primers sequences were attached to the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 of the core primers to decrease primers dimer formation. The same reverse primer was used for both V1 and V2 selective primers. qPCR primers are shown in Table 2. V4 does not possess a unique polymorphism which can be used for selective qPCR. Gene copy number was normalized to an autosomal reference gene, Ribonuclease P protein subunit p30 (RPP30, GeneID:615098, on BTA26. A fragment of 95 bp at position 12893277), RPP30, was used as a reference gene in human CNV studies (Wang et al. 2010). No CNV was reported for this gene region in previous studies of CNV in cattle (Bae et al. 2010; Fadista et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2010; Seroussi et al. 2010). The qPCR analysis was performed in duplicates using the Absolute Blue SYBER Green ROX mix kit (Thermo Fisher scientific, UK) according to the instructions of the manufacturer in a 17-\xc2\xb5l reaction volume, which included 2 \xc2\xb5l of DNA (30 ng/\xc2\xb5l), 1 \xc2\xb5l of each primer (10 pmol/\xc2\xb5l), 7.5 \xc2\xb5l of ultra pure water, and 7.5 \xc2\xb5l of Absolute Blue SYBER Green ROX Mix. The qPCR reaction was performed in the following conditions: 15 min at 95\xc2\xb0C for enzyme activation followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\xc2\xb0C, 1 min at 60\xc2\xb0C, using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. Amplification was followed by a dissociation curve analysis to confirm the presence of a single product and the absence of primer dimer. The threshold cycle number (CT) for each tested probe was used to quantify its relative abundance. The qbasePLUS software (Biogazelle, Ghent, Belgium) was used for the calculation of the relative quantities using RPP30 for normalization (D'haene et al. 2010). The qPCR primers that were designed to selectively amplify V3 failed, thus V3 was excluded from the analysis. Correlations between the CTs of the two duplicates were 0.8, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.9 for V1, V2, total KIAA1683, and RPP30, respectively. The standard curves of all qPCR probes were linear in all the tested DNA dilutions with R2 <0.98 and with slopes of \xe2\x88\x923.36, \xe2\x88\x923.30, \xe2\x88\x922.99, and \xe2\x88\x923.11, which indicate efficiency of 101, 100, 93, and 92% for V1, V2, total KIAA1683, and RPP30, respectively. The average CT of the lowest detectable DNA concentration point (LOD) in the standard curves were 30.7, 30.6, 26.8, and 25.7, while the average CTs of the nontemplate controls (NTC) were 37.1, 35.1, 32.8, and 31.9 for V1, V2, total KIAA1683, and RPP30, respectively. The differences between the average CT of the LOD and NTC were >4 cycles in all tested probes, which indicates nontemplate-specific products of <6.25%. Association of the NGS58879 SNP marker genotype with the bulls\xe2\x80\x99 breeding values for fertility was analyzed by the PLINK linear/logistic regression option (Purcell et al. 2007). The population included 900 sires, including the 10 sires tested by the daughter design. A regression analysis of 326 sires\xe2\x80\x99 breeding values for fertility on the overall CNV or specific variant copy number was performed using the \xe2\x80\x9cfit Y by X\xe2\x80\x9d option of the JMPIN 5.0.1a statistical software (SAS Institute Inc). In addition, multiple regression was performed for the sires\xe2\x80\x99 breeding values for fertility with NGS58879 and V1 as independent variables. Of the 704 SNPs in the QTL CI on BTA7 that was tested for concordance, only a single intergenic SNP, NGS-58779 positioned at 4922643 bp (Btau 4.0 genome assembly), showed apparent full concordance; all five patriarchs that were heterozygous for the QTL were heterozygous for the marker, and the remaining five sires, homozygous for the QTL, were homozygous for the marker. The \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d allele of the NGS-58779 was associated with the positive haplotype of the fertility QTL identified in the daughter design analysis in four of the five heterozygous sires, and corresponded to the effect associated with the marker in the general sire population. Thus concordance was obtained in 9 out of 10 families. The NGS-58779 marker showed a significant association to breeding values of sires for fertility in a sample of 900 sires (P \xe2\x89\xa4 1.5*10\xe2\x88\x926). The frequency of the \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d allele, associated with increased fertility, was 31.5%. The observed allele substitution effect was 0.57 trait units. The neighboring genomic region of the concordant SNP was analyzed in order to explore the linkage disequilibrium (LD) boundaries of the QTL region. Although the Plink haplotype phase analysis was performed without including relationships among bulls, no conflicts were found between the Plink and LSPH results. All chromosomes carrying the \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d allele of NGS-58779 shared a common haplotype extending from 4.65 to 4.92 Mbp (Table 3). A comparative map of the bovine common haplotype region and its human orthologous region (HSA19p13) is shown in Figure 1. The region contains 11 genes (CIST1, JUND, LSM4, GDF15, KIAA1683, LOC785387, PGPEP1, LRRC25, SSBP4, ISYNA1, and ELL) in the bovine gene map. Partial sequencing of the exons of four genes (CIST1, JUND, LSM4, and GDF15) did not identify a complete concordance between any of the polymorphisms and the QTL status of the patriarchs (Table 4). Bovine/human comparative mapping of the QTL region: lines connect the orthologous genes. The human KIAA1683 gene and the bovine orthologous duplication (LOC788637 and LOC618787) are marked in red. The SNP marker NGS-58879 is in the bottom of the BTA7 map and appears in red. The comparative map showed duplication in the bovine KIAA1683 orthologous genes (LOC788637 and LOC6181787). Alignment analysis demonstrated very high similarity in the sequence of both genes (\xe2\x88\xbc95% identity). Their intron 1 contains a duplication of a section of the exon 1 sequence. LOC788637 has three copies of the exon 1 sequence, while LOC6181787 has only two. Two repetitive regions are present in intron 4 of both gene duplicates. Sequencing analysis of the exons regions revealed 37 sites of polymorphism between the gene variants, 26 of which were predicted to be due to the differences between the two paralogues in the reference genome (Btau 4.0). Figure 2 summarizes the polymorphism patterns among the 10 sires for exons 1 to 6 (the full genotyping report is summarized in supporting information, Table S1). These patterns may be clustered into three major groups: 1) \xe2\x80\x9cheterozygous\xe2\x80\x9d in >95% of the sites (sires 3099, 2357, 3089, 3208, 3070, and 2278); 2) \xe2\x80\x9chomozygous\xe2\x80\x9d in 8 sites (sire 3258) and 3) \xe2\x80\x9chomozygous\xe2\x80\x9d in the same 16 sites (sires 2283, 3241, and 3274). Representation of the polymorphic sites found among the 10 sires along exons 1 to 6 of the KIAA1683 genes: Striped sites indicate the location of differences between the two gene duplicates in the reference genome. Sites in which only a single nucleotide was found for the individual sires are marked in black. The patterns of the 10 sires are clustered into three major groups: 1) \xe2\x80\x9cheterozygous\xe2\x80\x9d in >95% of the sites (3099, 2357, 3089, 3208, 3070, and 2278); 2) \xe2\x80\x9chomozygous\xe2\x80\x9d in 8 sites (3258) and 3) \xe2\x80\x9chomozygous\xe2\x80\x9d in the same 16 sites (2283, 3241, and 3274). The red dashed line indicates the section of exon 3 which was chosen as a target for the gene variants isolation. This region distinguishes between the three cluster groups with at least two unique homozygous sites. The sequencing analysis revealed 11 novel polymorphism sites in the KIAA1683 gene that were not found in the two reported gene variants. This indicated that there are additional variants of the gene. In order to isolate theses putative variants we focused on exon 3, which showed seven polymorphic sites, including four informative sites that differentiate the three patterns found in the sample of sires (Figure 2). We used two allele specific primers that selectively amplified the A/G alleles of the 4856941/4896528 polymorphism site (SP1 and SP2, Table 1). All sires amplified both alleles, and the resulting upstream sequence polymorphism is presented in Table 5. The polymorphism of cluster group 3 (sires 2283, 3241, and 3274) was different from that of the other sires, showing only two distinct variants of the KIAA1683 exon 3 region (V2 by SP2 and V3 by SP1). The polymorphism of the other sires upstream to the A/G site was complex, indicating the existence of additional gene variants. The SP2 primer enabled us to identify two distinct variants of the gene: V2 (isolated in sires 2278, 3070, 3089, 3208, 2357, 3241, 3274, and 2283), V4 (isolated in 3258) and both variants in 3099. The SP1 primer enabled us to isolate V3 in sires 2283, 3241, and 3274. The SP1 sequence of the other sires was identical, indicating a common gene version in addition to V3. This expected gene version (V1) is identical to the LOC788637 reference genome sequence. Thus, four different variants of the bovine KIAA1683 exon 3 were identified (Table 6, Figure 3). BLAST analysis of the variants identified perfect matches for the V1 and V2 variants in the bovine reference genome. V3 was found by BLAST analysis against the bovine HTGS sequence database, while V4 is novel (Table 6, Figure 3). Sequencing chromatograms of four different KIAA1683 variants. A 60-bp sequence within the KIAA1683 third exon is displayed. Arrows mark specific nucleotide changes that differentiate the gene variants. The relative copy number of the 10 sires for KIAA1683, and its V1 and V2 variants were estimated using qPCR (Figure 4). The results confirm the genotyping results using the variant specific analysis. Sire 3258 which lacks V2, and sires 2283, 3241, and 3274 which lack V1 showed only residual copy number reflecting the absence of these gene variants. The regressions of breeding values of 326 sires for fertility on their copy number for total KIAA1683 and V2 were not significant (Figure 5, A and C). On the other hand, a highly significant regression was found for V1 (P < 0.0001; R2 = 0.047, Figure 5B) which is similar to the association of the NGS-58779 SNP marker using the same population structure (P < 0.0003; R2 = 0.037, Figure 5D). When both NGS-58779 and V1 copy number were included in the model, both factors were significantly associated with fertility (P < 0.01 and P < 0.03, respectively), increasing the R2 to 0.069. Normalized relative copy number (arbitrary units) of total KIAA1683, V1 and V2 of the 10 sires with known QTL genotypes: QTL genotypes were determined by the daughter design; dotted bars denote the heterozygous sires. Genotypes of the NGS-58779 SNP \xe2\x80\x9cAA\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cAG\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGG\xe2\x80\x9d are indicated by striped, dotted, and blank bars, respectively. CNV was analyzed by qPCR and quantities were normalized to RPP30, an autosomal non-CNV reference gene. Values were normalized to the highest value of sire which was assigned the value of 2 (arbitrary units). Error bars indicates the standard error between the qPCR replicates. CNV association test: Linear regressions of sires\xe2\x80\x99 breeding values for fertility on copy number of total KIAA1683 (A), V1 (B),V2 (C), and genotypes of NGS-58779 (D). NGS-58779 genotypes were scored as 0, 1, and 2 for homozygotes (G), heterozygotes (AG), and homozygotes (A), respectively. Probabilities are given for the significant regressions. In cattle, numerous genome scans were conducted during the past 15 years to identify QTL. These scans, based either on daughter of granddaughter designs (Weller et al. 1990), led to the identification of many chromosomal regions with effects on nearly all of the economically important traits (http://www.genome.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/QTLdb/BT/index). However, the CI for QTL location is generally >20 cM, thus containing hundreds of genes. Increasing marker density beyond one marker per 10 cM has very limited effect on the length of the CI of the QTL (Ron and Weller 2007). The identification of a putative QTN requires full concordance with the QTL status of individuals. Such information can only be detected by pedigree analysis, such as daughter or granddaughter designs. The probability of obtaining full concordance by chance depends on the number of individuals with known QTL status analyzed, the number of segregating individuals (heterozygous for the QTL), and the number of markers tested (Ron and Weller 2007). The 27 cM 95% CI interval of the QTL for female fertility in the centromeric region of BTA7 (Weller et al. 2008) contains 704 SNPs from the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. Of these, only a single intergenic SNP, NGS-58779, showed nearly complete concordance (9 out of 10 families). The probability to obtain such concordance by chance is 0.000152 (see Materials and Methods). By accounting for multiple testing of 704 SNPs only 0.1 SNP is expected to achieve this concordance level by chance. Furthermore, a highly significant effect on female fertility was associated with this marker in the sample of 900 sires genotyped (P < 1.5*10\xe2\x88\x926). Haplotype phase analysis for SNP markers within the flanking 0.5 Mbp upstream and downstream to NGS-58779 interval showed that all chromosomes carrying the \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d allele of NGS-58779 shared a common haplotype extending from 4.65 to 4.92 Mbp (Table 3). However, because the frequencies of the SNPs alleles included in this haplotype were >0.8, this haplotype was also found in some of the chromosomes carrying the \xe2\x80\x9cG\xe2\x80\x9d allele of NGS-58779. On the other hand, no common haplotype associated with the \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d allele was discernable on the other side of NGS-58779. We hypothesize that this common haplotype region contains the causative mutation for this QTL. Cohen-Zinder et al. (2005) identified a common haplotypes among the two segregating sires for the QTL for milk protein on BTA6. The QTN was eventually identified in ABCG2, one of the five genes in this haplotype region. Comparative mapping of the common haplotype region to the human orthologous region on HAS19 revealed duplication in the bovine KIAA1683 gene (LOC788637 and LOC6181787). The two gene duplicates shared high sequence similarity (\xe2\x88\xbc95%). Among the genes in the region that were sequenced, only KIAA1683 revealed a high number of polymorphic sites that may indicate copy number variation. Twenty six sites were attributed to the differences between the two reference genome gene duplicates. The additional 11 sites indicated the possibility for more unidentified gene variants. The polymorphic patterns identified among the 10 sires, which clustered into three major groups, suggest that there are differences in the gene variants held by the different sires. The gene variants isolation analysis confirmed our assumption. A summary of the gene variants harbored by the 10 sires is presented in Table 7. The three sires homozygous for the NGS-58779 \xe2\x80\x9cG\xe2\x80\x9d allele\xe2\x80\x942283, 3241, and 3274\xe2\x80\x94share variants V2 and V3. The two sires homozygous for the NGS-58779 \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d allele\xe2\x80\x943099 and 3257\xe2\x80\x94also have variant V1. Sire 3099 also has variant V4. All four sires that are heterozygous for both the fertility QTL and the NGS-58779 marker\xe2\x80\x942278, 3070, 3089 and 3208\xe2\x80\x94have variants V1, V2, and V3. Sire 3258, which is heterozygous for the QTL, but shows opposite allelic association between the NGS-58779 and the QTL alleles, has a unique pattern of variants: V1, V3, and V4. The gene variants\xe2\x80\x99 patterns of the 10 sires may indicate the presence of a CNV, as the sires varied not only in the type of gene variants, but also in their number (from two to four). The qPCR analysis revealed a CNV not only in the total KIAA1683 but also in V1 and V2 specific gene variants. Previous work identified segmental duplication and CNV in this genomic region. Bae et al. (2010) used the BovineSNP50 BeadChip signal intensity to identify CNV region in Korean cattle. They identified a CNV region that spans BTA7: 4.65\xe2\x80\x935.03 Mbp, which overlaps with our common haplotype region (BTA7: 4.65-4.92 Mbp). Liu et al. (2009) performed a systematic computational genome-wide analysis of segmental duplications in cattle based on identifying paralogous sequences \xe2\x89\xa51 kb in length with \xe2\x89\xa590% sequence identity, and genomic regions that exhibit significant increase in depth of coverage in the whole genome shotgun sequences. The analysis identified significant peaks in both KIAA1683 genes indicating segmental duplication. In contrast to Bae et al. (2010), this analysis indicated that the segmental duplication in this region is limited only to the KIAA1683 genes. Of the four identified KIAA1683 gene variants identified by the allele specific PCR and sequencing, only V1 indicated an association with the NGS-58779 marker in the 10 sires analyzed. The sires that were homozygous for the NGS-58779 \xe2\x80\x9cG\xe2\x80\x9d allele (2283, 3241, and 3274) lack V1, while the sires homozygous for the \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d allele (3099 and 3257) and the heterozygous sires (2278, 3070, 3089, 3208, and 3258) all have V1 (Table 7). In recent years, CNV has been increasingly recognized as a major source of heritable variation that impacts complex traits (Redon et al. 2006). Thus, we quantified the copy number of total KIAA1683 and its variants, V1 and V2. Only V1 copy number showed a significant association with fertility in the general population (P < 0.0001). It appears that copy number variation of different gene variants might be considered as independent genetic markers for association analyses. A similar phenomenon was reported for the human CYP2D locus located on chromosome 22 (HSA22q12). CYP2D is an enzyme expressed in the human liver. The CYP2D locus consists of three tandem repeats of homologous sequences of which CYP2D6 is the functional gene, while CYP2D7 and CYP2D8 are pseudogenes. Apparently only CNV of CYP2D6 was associated with drug metabolism phenotype (Abraham et al. 2010; Ingelman-Sundberg 2004). Analogously, it is possible that V2 to V4 variants of KIAA1683 are pseudogenes, while V1 variant is the only active gene. This hypothesis may be tested by gene expression analysis which will identify the gene variants that are actually being transcribed to mRNA in different bovine tissues. Expression data for LOC788637 and LOC6181787 genes were searched in the bovine gene atlas but no informative results were found (Harhay et al. 2010, http://bovineatlas.msstate.edu/). Inclusion of both NGS-58779 and V1 copy number in the analysis model yielded statistical significance for both factors and increased the R2. It is expected that when a causal mutation is included in the analysis model with additional linked markers, only the causal mutation will be significant (Ron and Weller 2007). Thus both factors contribute to the explained variation, and apparently neither of them is the causal mutation. It should be noted that CIST1 also showed high concordance between the polymorphism and the segregation status of sires for the QTL. We demonstrate a new strategy for fine mapping QTL which combines GWAS data together with daughter design results and concordance testing. We identified a single intergenic SNP, NGS-58779, which showed concordance for 9 out of 10 sires, and a highly significant association with fertility in the population. We further identified a common haplotype associated with the rare favorable allele of the marker, from 4.65 to 4.92 Mbp on BTA7. Thus, the 27 cM CI of the fertility QTL was reduced to a 270 kbp region which contains only 11 genes that should be considered as positional candidates for the identification of the causative quantitative trait nucleotide. An analysis of the CNV in the KIAA1683 gene showed that only the number of copies of a specific gene variant (V1) was significantly associated with breeding values of sires for fertility. Thus quantifying the copy number of different gene variants is of paramount importance for association analyses. Communicating editor: Brenda J.

9,"['Thelma F. Madzima', 'E. Shannon Mills', 'Jack M. Gardiner', 'Karen M. McGinnis']","June 1, 2011.",Identification of Epigenetic Regulators of a Transcriptionally Silenced Transgene in Maize,"b'Transcriptional gene silencing is a gene regulatory mechanism essential to all organisms. Many transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are associated with epigenetic modifications such as changes in chromatin structure, acetylation and methylation of core histone proteins, and DNA methylation within regulatory regions of endogenous genes and transgenes. Although several maize mutants have been identified from prior forward genetic screens for epigenetic transcriptional silencing, these screens have been far from saturated. Herein, the transcriptionally silent b1 genomic transgene (BTG-silent), a stable, epigenetically silenced transgene in Zea mays (maize), is demonstrated to be an effective phenotype for a forward genetic screen. When the transgene is reactivated, a dark purple plant phenotype is evident because the B1 transcription factor activates anthocyanin biosynthesis, making loss of silencing mutants easy to identify. Using BTG-silent, ten new putative mutants were identified and named transgene reactivated1 through 11 (tgr1-6 and tgr8-11). Three of these mutants have been examined in more detail, and molecular and genetic assays demonstrated that these mutants have both distinct and overlapping phenotypes with previously identified maize mutants that relieve epigenetic transcriptional silencing. Linkage analysis suggests that tgr2 and tgr3 do not correspond to a mutation at previously identified maize loci resulting from other forward genetic screens, while tgr1 shows linkage to a characterized gene. These results suggest that the mutants are a valuable resource for future studies because some of the mutants are likely to reveal genes that encode products required for epigenetic gene regulation in maize but are not currently represented by sequenced mutations.Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is essential for the normal growth and development of organisms. Transcriptional regulation is accomplished via the association of transcription factors with genetic regulatory elements nearby or adjacent to the regulated gene and transcription factor accessibility to those sequences, which is dependent on the chromatin structure. In eukaryotic species, the establishment and maintenance of a particular conformation of chromatin involves an interdependent association of differentially methylated DNA, modified histones, and variations in nucleosome distribution and compaction (reviewed by Goldberg et al. 2007). A particular chromatin structure and its associated gene expression state is sometimes heritable across cell divisions, contributing to cellular differentiation and development (Jarillo et al. 2009). The methylation of cytosines in a symmetric CG context is highly conserved in plants and mammals and is generally considered to be associated with the regulation of gene expression, although the exact nature of the relationship between gene expression and DNA methylation is not completely understood (reviewed by Lee et al. 2010). In plants, cytosine methylation within gene promoters, repetitive sequences and transposons can be associated with transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) via the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway and can involve asymmetric cytosine residues (CHH, where H is any residue other than G) in addition to symmetric cytosine residues (CG, CHG). This pathway is reliant upon the activity of a set of proteins that produce small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) homologous to target loci and mediate epigenetic features on the chromosome at target loci (reviewed by Matzke et al. 2009; Simon and Meyers 2010). Although RdDM has been characterized most extensively in Arabidopsis, genetic screens in maize have identified several components of the pathway and the maize orthologs have been implicated in the regulation of both endogenous and transgenic loci, including those that participate in paramutation (reviewed by Arteaga-Vazquez and Chandler 2010). Paramutation occurs when two alleles interact in trans to heritably change the expression level of one allele (reviewed by Chandler 2010). Paramutation in maize has been described at several genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and include r1, b1, pl1, and p1 (Brink 1956; Coe 1959; Hollick et al. 1995; Sidorenko and Peterson 2001) (reviewed by Chandler et al. 2000). Each of these genes encodes a transcription factor that regulates the expression of the enzymes required for pigment biosynthesis, allowing transcriptional activity of these genes to be readily detected by the visual observation of pigment in plant tissues. At the b1 gene, paramutation requires the presence of tandem hepta-repeat sequences located 100 kb upstream of the b1 transcription start site (reviewed by Chandler 2010). This well-characterized example of paramutation involves transcriptional silencing of one allele, associated with changes in DNA methylation and chromatin structure within the tandem repeats (Haring et al. 2010; Stam et al. 2002a; Stam et al. 2002b). The b1 and pl1 systems have been used in genetic screens to identify mutants required for paramutation. Using either active Mutator (Mu) transposable elements or EMS mutagenesis, genetic screens based on these paramutation systems have identified several mutants. The b1 paramutation alleles were used to identify the mediator of paramutation (mop) mutants (Dorweiler et al. 2000; Sidorenko et al. 2009). Map-based cloning revealed that the first locus characterized, mop1, encodes a putative RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase similar to Arabidopsis RDR2 (Alleman et al. 2006). More recently, a dominant mutation designated Mop2-1 was cloned and shown to encode a protein similar to the second largest subunits of Pol IV and Pol V in Arabidopsis (Sidorenko et al. 2009). The pl1 paramutation system was used to identify several mutants designated required to maintain repression (Hale et al. 2007; Hollick and Chandler 2001; Stonaker et al. 2009). rmr1 encodes a putative SNF2-like ATPase chromatin remodeler (Hale et al. 2007) and rmr6 encodes a protein similar to Arabidopsis NRPD1, which is the large subunit of the plant specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol IV) (Erhard et al. 2009). rmr7 encodes an allele of mop2 (Stonaker et al. 2009). Identification and cloning of these genes provides strong evidence that RNA-directed transcriptional gene silencing is one mechanism underlying paramutation. While the endogenous b1 and pl1 systems have been useful in the discovery of genes required for both paramutation and TGS, many of the maize orthologs for Arabidopsis RdDM mutants have yet to be identified (reviewed by Arteaga-Vazquez and Chandler 2010). Approaching gene discovery through multiple screens will enhance the likelihood of characterizing as many components of epigenetic gene regulation as possible in this important model organism. The mop1-1, rmr1-1, and rmr2-1 mutants were identified in genetic screens for paramutation, and Mop1, Rmr1, and Rmr2 are also required for epigenetic silencing of two transgenes (McGinnis et al. 2006), including the b1 genomic transgene (BTG). This transgene includes the maize b1 genomic sequence (transcribed region including introns and exons) driven by the heterologous, highly expressed 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (Figure 1A); plants actively expressing this transgene are purple. A stably silent line was identified (BTG-silent) in which the plant tissues were green due to transcriptional silencing of the transgene, even when the transgene remained active in the kernel (McGinnis et al. 2006). Because none of the sequences required for b1 paramutation are included in the transgene (reviewed by Chandler 2010), and all of the described experiments used maize stocks that did not carry b1 alleles that participate in paramutation, the transcriptional silencing of this transgene is not directly related to b1 paramutation. BTG-silent provides a powerful marker for investigating epigenetic gene silencing and a system in which heritable changes in gene expression can be correlated with specific epigenetic marks and mechanisms (McGinnis et al. 2006). To identify other genes involved in epigenetic gene regulation, a forward genetic screen based on reactivation of BTG-silent was conducted using EMS mutagenized maize. Reactivation of the transgene is easily scored by visually monitoring accumulation of anthocyanin pigmentation. Herein, we report that the BTG-silent transgene and EMS mutagenesis were effectively used to identify multiple genes required for transcriptional silencing of transgenes in maize; these genes are referred to as transgene-reactivated (tgr). Initial genetic and molecular characterizations of these mutants are reported.'","b'Transcriptional gene silencing is a gene regulatory mechanism essential to all organisms. Many transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are associated with epigenetic modifications such as changes in chromatin structure, acetylation and methylation of core histone proteins, and DNA methylation within regulatory regions of endogenous genes and transgenes. Although several maize mutants have been identified from prior forward genetic screens for epigenetic transcriptional silencing, these screens have been far from saturated. Herein, the transcriptionally silent b1 genomic transgene (BTG-silent), a stable, epigenetically silenced transgene in Zea mays (maize), is demonstrated to be an effective phenotype for a forward genetic screen. When the transgene is reactivated, a dark purple plant phenotype is evident because the B1 transcription factor activates anthocyanin biosynthesis, making loss of silencing mutants easy to identify. Using BTG-silent, ten new putative mutants were identified and named transgene reactivated1 through 11 (tgr1-6 and tgr8-11). Three of these mutants have been examined in more detail, and molecular and genetic assays demonstrated that these mutants have both distinct and overlapping phenotypes with previously identified maize mutants that relieve epigenetic transcriptional silencing. Linkage analysis suggests that tgr2 and tgr3 do not correspond to a mutation at previously identified maize loci resulting from other forward genetic screens, while tgr1 shows linkage to a characterized gene. These results suggest that the mutants are a valuable resource for future studies because some of the mutants are likely to reveal genes that encode products required for epigenetic gene regulation in maize but are not currently represented by sequenced mutations. Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is essential for the normal growth and development of organisms. Transcriptional regulation is accomplished via the association of transcription factors with genetic regulatory elements nearby or adjacent to the regulated gene and transcription factor accessibility to those sequences, which is dependent on the chromatin structure. In eukaryotic species, the establishment and maintenance of a particular conformation of chromatin involves an interdependent association of differentially methylated DNA, modified histones, and variations in nucleosome distribution and compaction (reviewed by Goldberg et al. 2007). A particular chromatin structure and its associated gene expression state is sometimes heritable across cell divisions, contributing to cellular differentiation and development (Jarillo et al. 2009). The methylation of cytosines in a symmetric CG context is highly conserved in plants and mammals and is generally considered to be associated with the regulation of gene expression, although the exact nature of the relationship between gene expression and DNA methylation is not completely understood (reviewed by Lee et al. 2010). In plants, cytosine methylation within gene promoters, repetitive sequences and transposons can be associated with transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) via the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway and can involve asymmetric cytosine residues (CHH, where H is any residue other than G) in addition to symmetric cytosine residues (CG, CHG). This pathway is reliant upon the activity of a set of proteins that produce small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) homologous to target loci and mediate epigenetic features on the chromosome at target loci (reviewed by Matzke et al. 2009; Simon and Meyers 2010).

Using either active Mutator (Mu) transposable elements or EMS mutagenesis, genetic screens based on these paramutation systems have identified several mutants.

Identification and cloning of these genes provides strong evidence that RNA-directed transcriptional gene silencing is one mechanism underlying paramutation. While the endogenous b1 and pl1 systems have been useful in the discovery of genes required for both paramutation and TGS, many of the maize orthologs for Arabidopsis RdDM mutants have yet to be identified (reviewed by Arteaga-Vazquez and Chandler 2010). Approaching gene discovery through multiple screens will enhance the likelihood of characterizing as many components of epigenetic gene regulation as possible in this important model organism. The mop1-1, rmr1-1, and rmr2-1 mutants were identified in genetic screens for paramutation, and Mop1, Rmr1, and Rmr2 are also required for epigenetic silencing of two transgenes (McGinnis et al. 2006), including the b1 genomic transgene (BTG). This transgene includes the maize b1 genomic sequence (transcribed region including introns and exons) driven by the heterologous, highly expressed 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (Figure 1A); plants actively expressing this transgene are purple. A stably silent line was identified (BTG-silent) in which the plant tissues were green due to transcriptional silencing of the transgene, even when the transgene remained active in the kernel (McGinnis et al. 2006). Because none of the sequences required for b1 paramutation are included in the transgene (reviewed by Chandler 2010), and all of the described experiments used maize stocks that did not carry b1 alleles that participate in paramutation, the transcriptional silencing of this transgene is not directly related to b1 paramutation. BTG-silent provides a powerful marker for investigating epigenetic gene silencing and a system in which heritable changes in gene expression can be correlated with specific epigenetic marks and mechanisms (McGinnis et al. 2006). Phenotypes of plants transgenic for the b1 genomic transgene. (A) The b1 genomic transgene includes the 35S Cauliflower Mosaic Virus promoter (35SCaMV), the first intron of the maize Adh1 gene (Adh1 intron) to enhance expression, and the coding region of B1 (B1 genomic coding region). The region of the transgene analyzed by bisulfite sequencing is indicated (BA). (B) In nonmutant plants, the transgene is transcriptionally silent (BTG-silent), and there is no observable anthocyanin pigmentation in most plant tissues. (C) In the majority of the tgr mutants (with the exception of tgr3), the transgene is strongly reactivated, and transcription of BTG results in dark pigment in most above ground tissues (BTG-active). This phenotype was exhibited by tgr1, tgr2, tgr4, tgr5, tgr6, tgr8, tgr9, tgr10, and tgr 11; the plant shown is tgr1. (D). In tgr3 individuals, BTG-active has a much lower level of pigment in plant tissues relative to the other mutants. To identify other genes involved in epigenetic gene regulation, a forward genetic screen based on reactivation of BTG-silent was conducted using EMS mutagenized maize. Reactivation of the transgene is easily scored by visually monitoring accumulation of anthocyanin pigmentation. Herein, we report that the BTG-silent transgene and EMS mutagenesis were effectively used to identify multiple genes required for transcriptional silencing of transgenes in maize; these genes are referred to as transgene-reactivated (tgr). Initial genetic and molecular characterizations of these mutants are reported. The b1 genomic transgenic line has been described previously (McGinnis et al. 2006). Briefly, the line is transgenic for the 35SBTG construct, which is composed of the 35S Cauliflower Mosaic Virus promoter (35S CaMV), the first intron of maize alcohol dehydrogenase1 (included as an enhancer of expression), and the genomic sequence spanning the complete coding region and both the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2UTRs of the B-I allele of the maize b1 gene (McGinnis et al. 2006) (Figure 1A). B-I encodes a transcription factor which activates anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, leading to red or purple plant pigmentation in tissues where it is expressed (Selinger et al. 1998). Following transformation of the maize inbred line CG00526 with the 35SBTG construct, the transgenic line has been crossed for many generations with stocks that were recessive for b1 and the functionally redundant r1 locus, wild-type for the other transcriptional regulators and wild-type for all the biosynthetic enzymes required for pigment production. In this line, BTG is stably, heritably, and transcriptionally silenced (McGinnis et al. 2006). The chromosomal location of BTG is unknown, but the same transgenic event was used for all experiments described herein. Details on the genotype of this stock are available upon request. Mutagenesis was conducted by treatment of nontransgenic pollen with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) (Neuffer et al. 1997). EMS was diluted in paraffin oil and applied to pollen collected from nontransgenic b r-g stocks. After an incubation period, treated pollen was applied to ears of plants hemizygous or homozygous for BTG-silent. Ears were covered and allowed to mature for the remainder of the field growing season. Resulting seeds (the M1 generation) were planted and self-pollinated to make any introduced mutations homozygous. The M1 generation was monitored for increased pigment in plant tissues, which could be indicative of dominant or semidominant alleles that reactivated the transgene\xe2\x80\x94none were observed. After self-pollination, 60 transgenic M2 seeds were planted (McGinnis et al. 2006). Approximately 500 M2 families were screened, resulting in 10 putative recessive mutants identified. One M2 family was originally designated as tgr7, but it only segregated a very small number of dark plants, and no dark plants segregated upon replanting. This line was dropped from analysis; consequently, there is no putative mutant corresponding to tgr7. Putative mutants from this screen were designated tgr for transgene reactivated. For each individual, two independent loci are relevant for the experiments, one is the putative mutated locus (tgr1 through tgr11), and the other is the transgene (BTG-silent/active). Transgenic lines are designated by their tgr family number and the activation status of BTG. For example, a given family, which results from planting seed from a single ear, will be segregating wild-type and mutant tgr alleles and segregating the transgene, which will be silent or active. Genotyping is not possible as the mutated loci are as yet uncloned, but we refer to the various combinations of loci using the hypothesis that plants bearing silent transgenes are heterozygous for the recessive mutant or homozygous wild-type, while plants with active transgenes are homozygous for the mutation. Genomic DNA was isolated from adult leaf tissue using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen; www.qiagen.com) according to the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. Three BTG-silent and three BTG-active individual plants were used from segregating populations for each mutant. For bisulfite treatment, 200-500 ng of genomic DNA was converted using the MethylEasy Xceed Rapid DNA Bisulphite Modification Kit (Human Genetic Signatures Pty Ltd; North Ryde, Australia; www.geneticsignatures.com) according to the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. The Kismeth plant bisulfite sequencing primer design program (Gruntman et al. 2008) (http://katahdin.mssm.edu/kismeth) was used to design degenerate primers that were used to amplify converted DNA from the transgene. Primer locations were selected to selectively amplify the 35SBTG construct promoter and transcriptional enhancer regions. The selected primers designed to amplify portions of the 35S CaMV promoter + adh1 intron are as follows (R refers to purine; Y refers to pyrimidine): KM64: 5\xe2\x80\xb2-AAAGGAYAGTAGAAAAGGAAGGTGG-3\xe2\x80\xb2; KM69: 5\xe2\x80\xb2-CAAACTTTTCRCRCTTRCTAAACAC-3\xe2\x80\xb2; KM73: 5\xe2\x80\xb2-CCTCCTTRCAARTTRCAACATTCT-3\xe2\x80\xb2; KM78: 5\xe2\x80\xb2-ATYATTGYGATAAAGGAAAGG-3\xe2\x80\xb2. Nested PCR was used to amplify desired products. For the first round of PCR, KM64 and KM69 primers were used. PCR conditions were as follows: 94\xc2\xb0 for 3 min (1\xc3\x97); 94\xc2\xb0 for 30 sec, 52\xc2\xb0 for 1 min, 72\xc2\xb0 for 1.5 min (30\xc3\x97); 72\xc2\xb0 for 10 min (1\xc3\x97). 2 \xc2\xb5l of first-round PCR product were used as template for the nested PCR reaction using KM73 and KM78 primers. PCR conditions were as follows: 94\xc2\xb0 for 3 min (1\xc3\x97); 94\xc2\xb0 for 30 sec, 44\xc2\xb0 for 1 min, 72\xc2\xb0 for 1.5 min (30\xc3\x97); 72\xc2\xb0C for 10 min (1\xc3\x97). PCR products were gel purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (Promega; www.promega.com), cloned into the pCR4 TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen; www.invitrogen.com) and transformed into TOP10 Chemically competent cells (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 instructions. Cloned inserts were verified by PCR using insert specific primers and by restriction digestion using the EcoRI enzyme with restriction sites within the pCR4 vector. M13R primers were used for sequencing. The analysis included three individual plants for each of the seven different types of plant (tgr1 BTG-s, tgr1 BTG-a, tgr2 BTG-s, tgr2 BTG-sec, tgr2 BTG-a, tgr3 BTG-s, and tgr3 BTG-a). For each individual plant, 10-12 clones were sequenced and subjected to analysis. The Kismeth plant bisulfite sequencing analyzer (Gruntman et al. 2008) (http://katahdin.mssm.edu/kismeth) was used for methylation analysis. Clones that appeared to be duplicate representation of the same molecule were identified and removed from analysis (Henderson et al. 2010) as these might artificially overrepresent the methylation pattern and bias the data. Because a nonproofreading enzyme was used for PCR amplification, any sequences with more than 0.8% non C/T mismatches in the analyzed region were also removed them analysis. Removing these potentially duplicate or error-containing clones resulted in the evaluation of between 10 and 31 clones for each mutant genotype and BTG expression level that was analyzed. An endogenous unmethylated sequence, Probe A/PstI (Stam et al. 2002a), was used as a control to confirm that the retention of cytosines in the sequences did not result from incomplete conversion reactions. The PCR conditions are the same as those described for analysis of methylation in the 35S CaMV promoter of BTG and primers used to amplify this control sequence are: KM447: 5\xe2\x80\xb2-TTGGAAGAGTYAAGAGTGGYAGGTA-3\xe2\x80\xb2; KM 448: 5\xe2\x80\xb2-GGATGGATGTAATTAAATAYAGTAG-3\xe2\x80\xb2; KM449: 5\xe2\x80\xb2-CATRCATCTCCCTCTCTATCTC-3\xe2\x80\xb2; KM450: 5\xe2\x80\xb2-TTCAARCTATACACTRCAACAC-3\xe2\x80\xb2. The BTG-silent lines had been crossed for multiple generations with a stock that is polymorphic relative to the inbred line B73, enabling B73 to be used as the outcross parent for constructing mapping populations. To generate mapping populations, F1 seed resulting from crosses of tgr BTG-silent plants with B73 were planted, and plants were self-pollinated. Resulting F2 seed were planted, and tissue was collected from segregating families. For each mapping population, a minimum of 30 individuals homozygous for the mutant, based on their purple phenotype, were genotyped for a series of SSR markers with known chromosomal locations. SSR markers were selected based on their linkage with genes considered to be potential candidates for the tgr mutants (Mop1, Mop2, Rmr1, and Rmr6), and that they were polymorphic in the parental lines for the mapping populations. Chromosomal location, names of the linked markers, and primer sequences for each marker are provided in the supporting information (Table S1). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions and cycling profile are based on the original protocol established for maize SSR mapping (Sharopova et al. 2002). Briefly, PCR reactions for genotyping were as follows: 1\xc3\x97 Bioline PCR Buffer (www.bioline.com; as per manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions); 2.5 mm MgCl2; 0.4 mm each dNTP (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP); 50 ng each forward and reverse SSR primer; 0.3 units Bioline TAQ Polymerase; and 50 ng of genomic DNA template. PCR reactions were brought up to a final volume of 15 \xc2\xb5l with sterile H20. All PCR reactions were performed in a 96-well thin-walled microtiter style plate in a Perkin Elmer thermocycler using the following program: 95\xc2\xb0 for 1 min, 65\xc2\xb0 for 1 min, 72\xc2\xb0 for 1.5 min for one cycle and then decreased 1\xc2\xb0 per cycle, until the annealing temperature is 55\xc2\xb0. The regime is then 95\xc2\xb0 for 1 min, 55\xc2\xb0 for 1 min, 72\xc2\xb0 for 1.5 min, repeated for a total of 30 cycles. After the addition of 5\xc3\x97 loading dye (3 \xc2\xb5l), 4% Super Fine Resolution agarose (Amresco) gels were loaded with 7.5 \xc2\xb5l of each PCR reaction and run with constant voltage of 90-100 V for \xe2\x88\xbc120 min, which achieved the best resolution. Most maize SSR polymorphism band sizes range between 90 and 150 bp and are well resolved using these conditions that were generally able to detect size differences of 5-10 bp. After running, gels were stained in ethidium bromide and photographed and the resultant pictures evaluated for the F2 genotype. All gels contained multiple occurrences of the two parents to the F1 as this allowed for greater certainty in scoring the F2 progeny. The transgene is stably silent in wild-type backgrounds, resulting in plants without observable anthocyanin pigmentation in most tissues (Figure 1B). Based on nuclear run on assays, DNA methylation, and genetic analysis, the transgene is transcriptionally and epigenetically silenced in wild-type plants (McGinnis et al. 2006). Although prior work had shown that three genetic factors identified as required for paramutation were also required for maintaining transgene silencing (McGinnis et al. 2006), reactivation of BTG-silent had not been used for forward genetic screens. As it is likely that transcriptional silencing is dependent upon many proteins, a forward genetic screen for transgene reactivation was conducted to identify additional proteins required for silencing this locus. For this screen, nontransgenic pollen was mutagenized with EMS and applied to ears of plants that were homozygous or hemizygous for BTG-silent. Plants representing the M1 and M2 generations were visually screened for evidence of loss of transgene silencing associated with dominant or recessive mutations, respectively (Figure 1C). In the M1 generation, \xe2\x88\xbc3000 plants were screened, and all demonstrated a silent transgene phenotype, revealing no dominant nor semidominant mutations. Within the \xe2\x88\xbc500 M2 families, a total of 10 were observed to segregate plants with dark pigment, indicative of reactivated transgenes, and these were designated tgr1 through tgr6 and tgr8 through tgr11. In many M2 families, other morphological or chlorophyll pigment phenotypes were observed, consistent with a successful mutagenesis by EMS (Neuffer et al. 1997). In most of the putative tgr mutants, the plants were very dark, consistent with extensive up-regulation of the transgene (Figure 1C). The tgr3 mutant was an exception, as it exhibited a unique phenotype consistent with only a modest reactivation of the transgene (Figure 1D). Chi square (\xcf\x872) analysis was used to test the fit of the observed values to the expected values for the segregation of recessive mutations. Nine of the ten families demonstrated segregation consistent with the presence of a single, recessive, mutated allele (Table 1). The tgr9 family segregated significantly fewer individuals than expected for a recessive mutation over multiple generations (Table 2), indicating that this may not be a fully penetrant allele, that there may be reduced transmission of tgr9, or reduced viability of tgr9 homozygotes. Previous work demonstrated that mutations in two genes that encode maize orthologs of the Arabidopsis RdDM pathway resulted in reactivation of BTG-silent (McGinnis et al. 2006); mop1 that encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Alleman et al. 2006), and rmr1 that encodes a protein related to chromatin remodeling proteins (Hale et al. 2007). Maize mutants for the orthologs of every known component of this pathway in Arabidopsis have not yet been identified, and more than one silencing pathway could function at a given locus. Thus, the putative mutants from this screen might represent mutations in uncharacterized genes, new mutations in the maize RNA-directed transcriptional gene silencing pathway, or mutations in genes encoding proteins previously implicated in other gene silencing pathways. Segregating M2 families included BTG-silent and BTG-active plants, identified as green and purple plants, respectively (Figure 1). The BTG-silent individuals were potentially heterozygous for the mutation or homozygous for the wild-type allele, while the BTG-active individuals were potentially homozygous for a recessive allele. To test these hypotheses and to analyze the genetic behavior of the newly discovered putative mutants in further generations, BTG-silent, M2 individuals were self\xe2\x80\x93pollinated, and the activity of the transgene was observed in the M3 progeny. These tests were completed for seven of the mutants because tgr4, tgr5, and tgr8 proved difficult to propagate due to reduced seed set and low germination frequencies. With two exceptions discussed below, the segregation ratios observed in the M3 generation were similar to those observed in the M2 generation (Table 2). For tgr2, a reduced number of green plants and the appearance of a new phenotypic class with sectors (Figure 2) did not fit the simple hypothesis for segregation of a single recessive mutation (Table 2). This sectored phenotype (BTG-sec) is consistent with the transgene only being reactivated in some cell lineages, or with the transgene becoming resilenced in a subset of cells in the presence of an activating mutation. While the presence of the third phenotypic class might suggest tgr2 is semidominant, with heterozygous individuals exhibiting the sectored phenotype and homozygous mutant individuals exhibiting the confluently, darkly pigmented phenotype, the segregation ratio did not match that expectation based on \xcf\x872 analysis, nor the hypothesis that tgr2 is a dominant mutation. Furthermore, the M1 generation that produced tgr2 did not exhibit a BTG-active phenotype, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that tgr2 is a dominant or semidominant allele. The tgr2 data also did not match the expectation for two independent, recessive mutations (Table 2). This suggests that the tgr2 mutation has unexplained but complex genetic characteristics. Simple genetic analysis of these traits is further complicated by the persistence of the BTG-active phenotype after the inducing mutation has been segregated away. This characteristic of tgr2 is described in more detail below. Sectored phenotype observed in tgr2 families. In addition to a phenotype consistent with a high level of transcriptional activity, some plants in tgr2-derived lines exhibit a sectored phenotype consistent with transgene silencing in some sectors of affected individuals. This was an exceptional phenotype first observed in segregating M3 families generated by self-pollinating a heterozygous individual in the M1 generation (Table 2). In tgr3 families, fewer green plants than expected for a recessive mutation are observed. Similar to tgr2, in tgr3 families, the segregation ratios in the M3 generation do not match a 1:3, 3:1, or 7:9 ratio (Table 2), which would be consistent with recessive, dominant, or two independent mutations, respectively. As discussed for tgr2, this result may be indicative of complex genetic behavior of the tgr3-1 allele. Based upon their diverse genetic behaviors and ease of propagation, tgr1, tgr2, and tgr3 were selected for further investigation and subjected to more extensive molecular and genetic analysis. It was previously demonstrated that transgene activity persisted after segregating away the mop1 and rmr2 mutants (McGinnis et al. 2006). This was referred to as heritability of activation, and this activation became increasingly stable after subsequent generations of being maintained in wild-type backgrounds. Heritability of activation was tested in tgr1-, tgr2-, and tgr3- derived lines (Figure 3). For this assay, BTG-active plants in segregating families were crossed with nontransgenic, nonmutant genetic stocks, and transgenic plants were observed for pigmentation. Transgenic progeny from tgr2 parents were all darkly pigmented, indicating that the transcriptionally active state persisted through meiosis and was heritable, and that the transgene was not resilenced in the presence of the wild-type Tgr2 allele. This is the same phenotype previously observed for the mop1 and rmr2 mutants. Crossing strategy used for testing the heritability of transgene expression in tgr1, tgr2, and tgr3. Plants with active transgenes were outcrossed for one generation with nontransgenic, nonmutant plants to observe if the transcriptional activity would persist through meiosis and the reintroduction of wild-type proteins in the next generation. In the crosses the female parent is listed first and the male parent listed second. Reciprocal crosses varying whether the transgene was transmitted through male or female were done to compare heritability through both parents. In tgr1-derived lines, the progeny of outcrossed plants were all green, indicating that silencing was efficiently restored upon introduction of the wild-type allele. The tgr1 phenotype is similar to that reported for a rmr1 mutant in previous studies (McGinnis et al. 2006). For lines derived by outcrossing tgr3 individuals with active transgenes, heritability was observed at a relatively low level compared with tgr2-derived lines. Thus, the tgr mutants collectively present a full spectrum of epigenetically heritable and nonheritable phenotypes for in depth studies on transmission of epigenetic information from one generation to the next. Consistent with their involvement in the RdDM pathway, loss of Mop1, Rmr1, and Rmr2 resulted in reactivation of the BTG-silent correlated with a reduction in cytosine methylation of the 35S CaMV promoter within the transgene (McGinnis et al. 2006). To determine whether transgene reactivation in the newly discovered mutants correlated with changes in DNA methylation, cytosine methylation of the 35S CaMV promoter in the transgene was determined using sequence analysis of PCR products from bisulfite converted genomic DNA. The adh1 intron was used to specifically amplify the 35S CaMV promoter directly driving b1 expression (Figure 1A) and not the 35S promoter associated with the bar transgene that was used for selection when it was cotransformed (McGinnis et al. 2006). In nonmutant BTG-silent plants (six clones), 76.39% (CG, 88.33%; CHG, 80.55%; CHH, 73.10%) of the cytosines were methylated within the analyzed portion of the 35S CaMV promoter, which included 220 base pairs and a total of 60 cytosine residues. Approximately 410 base pairs of the immediately adjacent adh1 intron of the transgene was also analyzed; this region was consistently unmethylated in converted DNA extracted from BTG-active and BTG-silent plants (data not shown). Methylation within the 35S CaMV promoter region in BTG-active plants from segregating tgr1, tgr2, and tgr3 families were compared with BTG-silent plants within the same families. In combination, these three mutants allowed for analysis of plants demonstrating a range of pigmentation, phenotypic heritability, and inheritance patterns. In tgr1 and tgr2 mutants, the BTG-active plants were hypomethylated when compared with their BTG-silent siblings in all methylation contexts (Figure 4), which suggests that Tgr1 and Tgr2 may function in a gene silencing pathway that is associated with cytosine methylation in the promoters of regulated genes. This is consistent with observations of mop1, rmr1, and rmr2 mutants (McGinnis et al. 2006). Extensive hypomethylation was also observed in tgr2 BTG-sec individuals, although some methylation (<10%) is apparent in these plants. In contrast, promoter methylation levels in BTG-silent and BTG-active appear to be similar in tgr3 families. In tgr3 mutants, the low level of BTG activation could mean that there is a slight up-regulation of transcriptional activity in the presence of cytosine methylation, but it is also possible there is a very modest change in methylation that is below the sensitivity level for the detection technique. Further investigation into this relationship may yield additional insight into the correlation between DNA methylation and transcriptional activity. Methylation of the 35S CaMV promoter in three tgr mutants. Bisulfite sequencing was used to determine whether there were differences in CG, CHG, and CHH methylation of the 35S promoter in tgr BTG-active (tgr BTG-a) plants for tgr1, tgr2, and tgr3 relative to control siblings carrying BTG-silent (BTG-s). The tgr2 mutation includes an additional sectored phenotype (Figure 2) denoted as tgr2 BTG-sec. The level of methylation is reported as the percentage of total cytosines in the 35S CaMV promoter exhibiting methylation. The number of clones for each genotype is indicated in parentheses, the analyzed region represents a total of 60 cytosines. The loss of epigenetic gene silencing characteristic of the mutants identified in this screen is similar to the phenotypes used to identify mop1, mop2, rmr1, and rmr6 mutants (reviewed by Arteaga-Vazquez and Chandler 2010). This phenotypic similarity may be an indication that the tgr mutants represent alleles of these cloned genes. Similar to the phenotypes previously reported for rmr1 mutants (McGinnis et al. 2006), tgr1 exhibited DNA hypomethylation, but a lack of meiotic heritability of transcriptional reactivation of BTG. The persistence of transgene activity into the next generation after outcrossing as demonstrated by tgr2-1, rmr2-1, and mop1-1 confounds allelism analysis by complementation analysis for some mutants, so a molecular approach was used to examine linkage of the tgr mutants with genes with previously sequenced mutations, including Mop1, Mop2,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rmr1, and Rmr6. Cloning and sequencing of the rmr2-1 mutation has not been published. To test for linkage of tgr1 with sequenced mutations, a total of 36 tgr1 BTG-active individuals were analyzed with SSR markers tightly linked to cloned genes associated with epigenetic gene regulation in maize, mop1, mop2, rmr1, and rmr6. For three genes no linkage was identified (Table 3). For an Rmr6-linked marker, the tgr1 parental allele was overrepresented, suggesting that the gene bearing the tgr1 mutation lies on chromosome 1, and is linked to rmr6. The presence of heterozygous individuals in this small population suggests that tgr1 is not an allele of rmr6. Several developmental abnormalities have been described for rmr6-1 and rmr6-2 alleles, including abnormal leaf polarity and male inflorescence development (Parkinson et al. 2007), none of which have been observed in segregating tgr1 families. Further mapping and complementation tests will be required to determine the molecular identify of tgr1. There is also some evidence of an overrepresentation of the B73 allele of a chromosome 2 localized marker in this population. Segregation distortion has been reported in other maize mapping populations, and the effected loci seem to vary in a population-dependent manner (Sharopova et al. 2002). The presence of a higher number of individuals with the B73 allele than the tgr parent allele for this marker may either be caused by observation of segregation in a relatively small population or reflect an example of segregation distortion in the population. In addition to the characteristic loss of epigenetic silencing phenotype, tgr2 exhibited DNA hypomethylation and heritability of transgene reactivation, which are phenotypes that have been previously reported for mop1 and rmr2 mutants (McGinnis et al. 2006). Tgr2 linkage was analyzed in a similar manner to that described for tgr1 to determine if these common phenotypes were an indication of allelism between tgr2 and previously sequenced mutations. To test linkage of the tgr2 BTG-active phenotype with the candidate genes, 38 individuals were analyzed. For each analyzed gene, populations of purple plants exhibiting the tgr2-related BTG-active phenotype were not genotypically biased toward the tgr2 parent allele for that locus (Table 4), suggesting a lack of linkage between the phenotype and the genetic locus being tested. This suggests that although tgr2 shares many phenotypes with previously characterized mutations in these genes, it is unlikely to represent an allele of one of these genes. For some markers, the B73 allele was detected in more individuals than the tgr2 parental allele, indicating an unusual segregation pattern and potential segregation distortion. While more subtle than that observed for other mutants (Figure 1D), the tgr3 phenotype is indicative of a reduction in the epigenetic silencing at BTG. While the BTG-a phenotype is notably distinct from that observed for other mutants, loss of silencing is consistent with the phenotype of mop1, rmr1, and rmr2 mutants. Thus, linkage was tested for tgr3 as described for tgr1 and tgr2 (Table 5). In tgr3 BTG-active plants, the parental mutant alleles were not overrepresented and the B73 parental alleles were not underrepresented, demonstrating that tgr3 is not an allele of mop1, mop2, rmr1, or rmr6. The B73 allele appeared to be overrepresented for a marker on chromosome 1; segregation distortion toward the B73 allele was reported for several markers in this chromosomal region in an intermated B73 / Mo17 population (Sharopova et al. 2002). These results demonstrate that reactivation of the silent 35SBTG transgene in maize is an effective epigenetic phenotype for use in a forward genetic screen. The application of this screen led to the identification of multiple mutants, which exhibit some distinct phenotypes relative to one another and to previously identified maize mutants that can reactivate the silent transgene. Mapping studies suggest that tgr2 and tgr3 do not represent alleles of previously cloned genes with similar phenotypes in maize, while tgr1 resides on chromosome 1 and is linked to rmr6. Further, tgr2- and tgr3-derived lines exhibited persistent transgene reactivation after the reactivating mutation had been segregated away, meaning that BTG-silent provides a useful platform for studying heritable changes in gene expression in plants. Additional study of these mutants should yield further insight into epigenetic gene regulation.

A common feature associated with subtelomeric regions in different eukaryotes is the presence of long arrays of tandemly repeated satellite sequences. However, studies on molecular organization and evolution of subtelomeric repeats are rare. We isolated two subtelomeric repeats, CL14 and CL34, from potato (Solanum tuberosum). The CL14 and CL34 repeats are organized as independent long arrays, up to 1-3 Mb, of 182 bp and 339 bp monomers, respectively. The CL14 and CL34 repeat arrays are directly connected with the telomeric repeats at some chromosomal ends. The CL14 repeat was detected at the subtelomeric regions among highly diverged Solanum species, including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). In contrast, CL34 was only found in potato and its closely related species. Interestingly, the CL34 repeat array was always proximal to the telomeres when both CL14 and CL34 were found at the same chromosomal end. In addition, the CL34 repeat family showed more sequence variability among monomers compared with the CL14 repeat family. We conclude that the CL34 repeat family emerged recently from the subtelomeric regions of potato chromosomes and is rapidly evolving. These results provide further evidence that subtelomeric domains are among the most dynamic regions in eukaryotic genomes.The terminal regions of eukaryotic chromosomes are organized as a specialized structure to protect and maintain the stability of the chromosomes. Telomeres in most eukaryotes consist of short, tandemly repeated DNA sequences, such as (TTTGGG)n in humans and (TTTAGGG)n in plants (Zakian 1995). The length of such telomeric repeats can be extended during cell cycles by telomerase, a telomere-specific reverse transcriptase. In contrast to the extensive research on telomeres, there is only limited information available about the DNA sequences and the function associated with subtelomeric regions, which are immediately adjacent to telomeres. Subtelomeric regions contain repetitive sequences or duplicated DNA fragments, which make cloning and sequencing difficult. Thus, subtelomeric regions have not been fully sequenced even among the most extensively sequenced eukaryotic genomes using the traditional clone-by-clone\xe2\x80\x93based sequencing approach (Mizuno et al. 2006; Riethman et al. 2005). The presence of long arrays of tandemly repeated satellite sequences is a common feature associated with subtelomeric regions of many eukaryotic chromosomes. Subtelomeric repeats have been reported in numerous plant and animal species (Kojima et al. 2002; Sharma and Raina 2005; Spence et al. 1998). However, the function of such subtelomeric repeats remains largely unknown. Plants in the Alliaceae family lack the typical (TTTAGGG)n telomeric DNA sequences that are almost universal in all other plants (Fuchs et al. 1995). Instead, the chromosomal ends of Alliaceae species consist of highly repetitive satellite repeats, which structurally resemble the subtelomeric repeats found in other plant species. These satellite repeats were proposed to replace the function of telomeric DNA in stabilizing the chromosomal ends (Pich et al. 1996). Recently, Jain et al. (2010) demonstrated that Schizosaccharomyces pombe could survive in the absence of telomerase. Interestingly, the chromosomes in surviving cells had amplified subtelomeric DNA derived from rDNA (Jain et al. 2010). These results suggest that subtelomeric repeats may provide a supplemental role in chromosome stability. Although subtelomeric repeat sequences have been reported in numerous plant species. However, an in-depth study of the structure and organization of subtelomeric repeats has been done in only a few species (Cheng et al. 2001; Dechyeva and Schmidt 2006; Zhong et al. 1998). Most importantly, it remains largely unknown how these repeats emerged and evolved during evolution. We identified two subtelomeric repeats, CL14 and CL34, in potato (Solanum tuberosum). The structure and organization of these two repeats were studied using a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and fiber-FISH techniques. We also report the evolutionary history of these two repeats in a set of diverged Solanum species.'","b'Subtelomeric domains immediately adjacent to telomeres represent one of the most dynamic and rapidly evolving regions in eukaryotic genomes.

The structure and organization of these two repeats were studied using a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and fiber-FISH techniques. We also report the evolutionary history of these two repeats in a set of diverged Solanum species. A homozygous doubled monoploid (2n = 2x = 24) clone, DM1-3, which was developed from a diploid potato species Solanum phureja (Snider and Veilleux 1994), was used for 454 genome sequencing and cytogenetic studies. Five Solanum species, including S. verrucosum (A genome, PI 275260), S. cardiophyllum (B genome, PI 347759), S. chromatophilum (P genome, PI 365339), tomato (S. lycopersicum, cv MicroTom) (T genome), and S. etuberosum (E genome, PI 558288), were used for comparative FISH mapping of the telomeric and subtelomeric repeats. All these species are diploids with a chromosome number of 24. Seeds of all Solanum species, except for the tomato variety MicroTom, were obtained from USDA/ARS, Potato Introduction Station, Sturgeon Bay, WI. A set of 1,238,463 whole genome shotgun 454 sequences derived from DM1-3 was subjected to similarity-based clustering analysis (Macas et al. 2007) to identify major families of repetitive sequences present in the potato genome. The average length of the 454 reads was 361 bp and the whole set represented 446.7 Mb of sequence data, corresponding to about 0.53\xc3\x97 coverage of the potato genome (1C = 840 Mb) (Arumuganathan and Earle 1991). The clustering analysis was performed using a graph-based approach as described previously (Novak et al. 2010), employing read similarity cutoff of 90% over at least 55% of the longer sequence length. Reads within individual clusters were assembled and further investigated using a set of custom-made BioPerl and R scripts to find out which type and family of repeats they represent (Macas et al. 2007; Novak et al. 2010). Clusters containing satellite repeats were identified based on the presence of tandem subrepeats within their read or assembled contig sequences. These satellite repeats were characterized using oligomer frequency analysis of their 454 reads as described previously (Macas et al. 2010). The analysis was performed for oligonucleotides of length k = 17 or 20 and reconstruction of major sequence variants was done using a minimal seed k-mer frequency of 0.0001 and extension threshold of 10%. Mitotic and meiotic chromosomes were prepared following published protocols (Dong et al. 2000; Lou et al. 2010). An A. thaliana plasmid clone, pAtT4 (Richards and Ausubel 1988), was used as a telomeric DNA probe. Probes for the CL14 and CL34 repeats were prepared by PCR amplification from DM1-3 genomic DNA using primers designed according to the monomers sequences: 14F (5\xe2\x80\xb2CTGGGGCACATTTGACCTTC3\xe2\x80\xb2), 14R (5\xe2\x80\xb2 ATTTTGCCGATTTTCGTGTG3\xe2\x80\xb2), 34F (5\xe2\x80\xb2 ACGCCTTTTTGCTCATTCTTA3\xe2\x80\xb2), and 34R (5\xe2\x80\xb2CCCGGCTACCTTCAATCTTTA3\xe2\x80\xb2). The PCR was performed in 25 \xce\xbcl of reaction (1\xc3\x97 PCR buffer, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 \xce\xbcM primers, 0.5 U of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California), 10 ng of template DNA) for 32 cycles of 30 sec at 95\xc2\xb0C, 30 sec at 58\xc2\xb0C and 45 sec at 72\xc2\xb0C, preceded by initial denaturation (1 min at 95\xc2\xb0C) and followed by a final extension step (5 min at 72\xc2\xb0C). Probes were labeled with either biotin-16-UTP or digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) using a standard nick translation reaction. FISH and fiber-FISH were conducted according to published procedures (Jackson et al. 1998; Jiang et al. 1995). Chromosomes were counterstained with 4\xe2\x80\x99,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in Vectashield antifade solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The fluorescence signals were captured using a Hamamatsu CCD camera. The images were processed with Meta Imaging Series 7.5 software using an Olympus BX51 epifluorescence microscope. The final contrast of the images was processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 software. The primers described above for the CL14 and CL34 repeats along with a telomeric DNA primer, Tel (5\xe2\x80\xb2GTTTAGGGTTTAGGGTTTAG3\xe2\x80\xb2), were used to amplify potential junctions between the three different repeats. The PCR reactions were carried out the same as for the FISH probe amplification, using a single primer or combinations of two primers (14F/34R, 34F/14R, 34R/Tel, 14R/Tel). Distinct bands less than 1000 bp were excised from agarose gels and the DNA was purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). Purified DNA fragments were cloned using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Positively transformed clones were selected using colony PCR and DNA was isolated using a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Sequencing of positive clones was conducted using ABI Big Dye sequencing. Obtained sequences were evaluated for quality and vector sequences were removed using Pregap4 version 1.5 in the Staden package (http://staden.sourceforge.net/). The junctions and structure of the repeats in the quality sequences was analyzed by aligning them with the consensus sequences of CL14, CL34, and telomeric repeats using Gap4 version 4.10 (Staden package) with manual refinements. Subtelomeric satellite repeats were identified by bioinformatic analysis of 1.24 million 454 Roche sequence reads generated from a homozygous diploid potato clone, DM1-3 (2n = 2x = 24), which was derived from chromosome doubling of a monoploid. DM1-3 has been sequenced by the Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (http://www.potatogenome.net). The analysis was performed using a similarity-based 454 read clustering approach which allows de novo identification of all major types of genomic repeats (Macas et al. 2007; Novak et al. 2010). Resulting clusters of mutually overlapping reads corresponding to different repeat families were screened for the presence of tandem repeats and their chromosomal localization was investigated by FISH. Two repeats, CL14 and CL34, were found to be located at chromosome termini (see below). Based on 454 read counts in the clusters (5313 reads in CL14 and 2614 reads in CL34) the repeats were estimated to make up 0.4% and 0.2% of the DM1-3 genome, respectively. Due to large amounts of sequencing data available for these repeats their composition was investigated using an alignment-free approach employing oligomer frequency statistics (Macas et al. 2010). This analysis led to the identification of the most conserved sequence motifs and to reconstruction of consensus sequences for both repeats (Figure 1 and supporting information, Figure S1). Consensus sequences of CL14 and CL34 repeats inferred from fragments reconstructed from the most frequent 17-mers (CL14) or 20-mers (CL34) detected in 454 sequence reads. The consensus is displayed as sequence logo where the height of the letters corresponds to frequencies of corresponding k-mers. Major sequence variants are displayed along with the prevailing bases. The CL14 region conserved in other Solanum and Nicotiana satellite repeats is underlined. Detailed information about reconstructed fragments used to create the consensus logos are provided as Figure S1. The CL14 repeat is composed of 182-bp monomers that are well homogenized in the potato genome based on the absence of distinct sequence variants among the most frequent reconstructed fragments (Figure S1). CL14 sequences do not share any detectable similarity to the CL34 repeat. Searching GenBank and PlantSat (Macas et al. 2002) databases revealed a high similarity to a subtelomeric tandem repeat from Solanum brevidens (88% identity over 147 bp) (Preiszner et al. 1994) and lower similarities scattered along its monomer sequence with related satellite repeats from S. circaeifolium and tomato (S. lycopersicum) (Schweizer et al. 1988; Stadler et al. 1995). In addition, a small part of the CL14 sequence was found to be present in a set of diverse Nicotiana satellite repeats including HRS, GRS and NPAL repeats (Gazdova et al. 1995; Koukalova et al. 2010; Matyasek et al. 1989). The similarity region varied in length among the different satellites, but it always included the region between positions 149-163 of the CL14 monomer (underlined in Figure 1). The CL34 repeat was characterized by predominant monomer size of 339 bp. In contrast to CL14, the CL34 sequences were more variable, including the presence of short direct subrepeats and various sequence subfamilies (Figure S1). Sequences similar with CL34 were only detected in two satellite repeats from S. acaule and S. demissum (Schweizer et al. 1988; Zanke and Hemleben 1997), both of these species being closely related to cultivated potato (Rodriguez et al. 2010). FISH analysis revealed that both CL14 and CL34 repeats locate exclusively at the distal ends of most DM1-3 chromosomes (Figure 2, a and b). The copy numbers of the two repeats at different chromosomal ends varied significantly based on the sizes and intensities of the FISH signals. FISH mapping of CL14 and CL34 repeats in diploid potato clone DM1-3. (a) FISH mapping of CL14 on somatic metaphase chromosomes. (b) FISH mapping of CL34 on somatic metaphase chromosomes. (c) FISH mapping of both CL14 (green) and CL34 (red) on somatic metaphase chromosomes. Homologous chromosome pairs were identified based on FISH signal patterns and arranged according to their sizes. (d) FISH mapping of CL14 (green) and the telomeric DNA probe pAtT4 (red) on meiotic pachytene chromosomes. (e) FISH mapping of CL34 (green) and the telomeric DNA probe pAtT4 (red) on meiotic pachytene chromosomes. Arrows in (d) and (e) point to several interstitial signals derived from the telomeric DNA probe. Bars = 5 \xce\xbcm. The subtelomeric locations of these two repeats were confirmed by co-hybridization with a telomeric DNA probe, pAtT4, on meiotic pachytene chromosomes (Figure 2, d and e). All of the CL14 and CL34 signals partially or completely overlapped with the telomeric DNA signals. Therefore, these two repeats are exclusively located at the end of the chromosomes. The pAtT4 probe, which was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana (Richards and Ausubel 1988), generated several major FISH signals in interstitial chromosomal regions (Figure 2, d and e), confirming the previous reports that potato centromeric regions contain telomere-similar DNA sequences (Tek and Jiang 2004; Zhu et al. 2008). When the CL14 and CL34 repeats were comapped on somatic metaphase chromosomes, several chromosomal ends hybridized to both repeats. It was not possible to determine the relative distal/proximal positions of the two repeats at the same chromosomal ends (Figure 2c). However, several CL34 loci were found to be distal to the CL14 loci at the same ends on pachytene chromosomes (Figure S2). Interestingly, CL34 tended to be dominant at the ends of the long arms, whereas CL14 more frequently dominated at the ends of the short arms (Figures 2c and 3). Only two of the 24 chromosomal ends lacked unambiguous CL14 or CL34 signals on somatic metaphase chromosomes (Figure 3). However, we cannot exclude the possibility of the presence of short arrays of CL14/CL34 repeats at these ends, which may be beyond the detection limit the FISH technique. An ideogram illustrating the distribution of CL14 and CL34 repeats on potato chromosomes. This ideogram was generated based on the FISH information from Figure 2c. Sequence analysis revealed no similarity between the CL14 and CL34 repeats, indicating that these elements are two unrelated repeat families. We conducted dual-color fiber-FISH using DNA fibers prepared from DM1-3. We did not observe any unambiguous intermingled fiber-FISH signals derived from both repeats. Thus, the CL14 and CL34 repeats are organized as independent arrays in the potato genome. Direct connections between the CL14 and CL34 repeat arrays were frequently observed on fiber-FISH signals. We observed numerous combinations of long/short CL14 signals connected with long/short CL34 signals (Figure 4, a\xe2\x80\x93d). These different combinations of long/short CL14/CL34 signals likely represent DNA loci derived from different chromosomal ends. A clear gap was observed at the CL14-CL34 junctions on some fibers (Figure 4e), suggesting the presence of other sequences at the junction between the two repeat arrays. However, a gap either too small (submicroscopic size) or too big (which would result in two \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d signals) may not be detected by the fiber-FISH technique. Fiber-FISH analysis of CL14 and CL34 repeats. (a\xe2\x80\x93d) Representative fiber-FISH signals with different combinations of long and short CL14 (red) and CL34 (green) signals. The red and green signals appear to be directly connected on all four signals. (e) A fiber-FISH signal containing a clear gap between the CL14 and CL34 signals. Bars = 50 \xce\xbcm. The longest observed CL14 and CL34 fibers were 1031 and 322 \xce\xbcm, respectively, representing approximately 3 Mb and 966 kb of DNA. Thus, a single CL14 or CL34 locus can account for up to 0.3% or 0.1% of the potato genome. The fiber-FISH results suggest that the percentages of these two repeats in the potato genome are much higher than the estimations based on the 454 sequence read counts. This discrepancy may be caused by the low genome coverage (0.5\xc3\x97) of the 454 sequencing data, which may lead to sequencing bias against repetitive DNA. DNA primers specific to CL14 and CL34 were designed to amplify potential junctions between these two repeats. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using different combinations of these primers produced several distinct bands (Figure 5). Three PCR fragments corresponding to approximately 200 bp, 500 bp, and 1000 bp were cloned and sequenced. We sequenced 2, 19, and 5 clones, respectively, derived from these three PCR fragments. Sequence analysis revealed that the junctions between the CL34 and CL14 arrays were either a direct connection in different positions within the repeat monomer or a mixture of fragments of both repeats. Only one 30-bp unknown DNA sequence was found in the sequenced junction clones (Figure 5). These results confirmed the direct connection of the CL14 and CL34 arrays at some chromosomal ends. Cloning and characterization of the junctions among the telomeric and subtelomeric repeats. Left panel: PCR using primers designed from telomeric DNA (Tel), CL14 (14F and 14R), and CL34 (34F and 34R) repeats. PCRs using individual primers were performed to identify potential amplified fragments derived from the same primers. Arrowheads point to the PCR fragments that were cloned and sequenced. Right panel: Three patterns of CL14-CL34 junction sequences were found in the sequenced junction clones. Truncated CL14 and CL34 repeats and an unknown sequence of 30 bp were found at the junction regions. (Note that the schematic has not been drawn to scale.) In order to reveal the association of the two subtelomeric repeats with telomeric DNA, we conducted fiber-FISH experiments using pAtT4 and CL14/CL34 as probes. Direct connections between pAtT4 and CL14/CL34 signals were observed on some DNA fibers (Figure 6, a and b). However, some fiber-FISH signals showed unambiguous gaps in the junction between telomeric DNA and the CL14/CL34 signals (Figure 6, a and b), suggesting the presence of additional DNA sequences at the junctions. Fiber-FISH analyzing the association of CL14 and CL34 repeats with telomeric DNA. (a) Five representative fiber-FISH signals derived from probes pAtT4 (red) and CL14 (green). (b) Five representative fiber-FISH signals derived from probes pAtT4 (red) and CL34 (green). Only the most proximal part of each CL14/CL34 signal was included in each image. Note the different sizes of the telomeric DNA and gap in the junctions, indicating these signals may be derived from different chromosomal ends. (c) Fiber-FISH analysis of telomere (yellow), CL34 (red), and CL14 (green). The CL34 signals within the four images show significantly different sizes. Only the most proximal part of each CL14 signal was included in the image. We then conducted fiber-FISH using three probes: CL34 (red), CL14 (green), and pAtT4 (yellow, by mixing 50% pAtT4 DNA in red and 50% pAtT4 DNA in green). In all fiber-FISH signals that contain all three repeats, the CL34 repeat array always localized between telomeric DNA and a CL14 repeat array (Figure 6c). These results agree with the observed distal positions of CL34 repeats relative to CL14 repeats on the pachytene chromosomes (Figure S2). We analyzed a total of 38 telomere-CL34-CL14 fiber-FISH signals. The CL34 arrays within these signals can be grouped into five size categories with average sizes of 34.9 \xc2\xb1 0.6 \xce\xbcm (n = 4), 80.3 \xc2\xb1 0.9 \xce\xbcm (n = 20), 146.2 \xc2\xb1 6.0 \xce\xbcm (n = 5), 198.1 \xc2\xb1 1.0 \xce\xbcm (n = 5) and 289.6 \xc2\xb1 12.0 \xce\xbcm (n = 4), respectively, which may represent DNA loci at different chromosomal ends. PCR using a telomeric DNA primer (Tel) with either CL14 or CL34-specific primers produced several distinct bands. We cloned three PCR fragments (308 bp, 481 bp, and 1013 bp) derived from the Tel/34R primer pair and one PCR fragment (940 bp) from the Tel/14R primer pair (Figure 5). Sequencing and analysis of a total of 22 plasmid clones revealed that the CL14 and CL34 repeats were all directly connected with the telomeric repeats within these junction clones, although different incomplete CL14/CL34 monomers were found at the junctions. FISH mapping of CL14 and CL34 repeats was performed on metaphase chromosomes of several Solanum species, including tomato (S. lycopersicum), which has diverged from potato for approximately 7 million years (Nesbitt and Tanksley 2002), and S. etuberosum, which is more distantly related to potato than tomato is to potato. S. verrucosum (A genome species), a possible progenitor of cultivated potato (Rodriguez et al. 2010), is the closest relative to potato among the species we investigated. S. cardiophyllum (B genome species) and S. chromatophilum (P genome species) are more distantly related cultivated potato than S. verrucosum. Both CL14 and CL34 showed similar hybridization patterns on chromosomes of S. verrucosum compared with DM1-3 chromosomes (Figure 7, a and b). Overall, the CL14 repeat showed a similar hybridization pattern among all Solanum species, although few nonsubtelomeric FISH signals were observed on chromosomes in several species (Figure 7, b and c). Thus, the CL14 repeat has largely maintained its subtelomeric locations among Solanum species that have diverged for more than 7 million years. However, the CL34 repeat generated very faint subtelomeric signals in S. cardiophyllum (Figure 7c) and tomato (Figure 7e) and no unambiguous signals (only very faint background signals) in S. chromatophilum (Figure 7d) and S. etuberosum (Figure 7f). These results show that the CL34 repeat has emerged recently and been amplified in potato and its close relatives. FISH mapping of CL14 and CL34 repeats among six different Solanum species. (a) DM1-3 potato (A genome). (b) S. verrucosum (A genome). (c) S. cardiophyllum (B genome). (d) S. chromatophilum (P genome). (e) Tomato (T genome). (f) S. etuberosum (E genome). The red (CL14) and green (CL34) color channels were digitally separated for better visualization of the FISH signals. Bars = 5 \xce\xbcm. Cytologically confirmed subtelomeric satellite repeats have been reported in a number of plant species, including rice (Cheng et al. 2001), tomato (Lapitan et al. 1989), maize (Li et al. 2009), barley (Brandes et al. 1995), tobacco (Chen et al. 1997; Kenton et al. 1993), rye (Vershinin et al. 1995), Silene latifolia (Buzek et al. 1997), and Beta species (Dechyeva and Schmidt 2006). The subtelomeric locations of these repeats were confirmed mostly by in situ hybridization on somatic metaphase chromosomes. In some studies, the close physical association of these repeats with telomeres was demonstrated by either fiber-FISH (Cheng et al. 2001; Zhong et al. 1998; Dechyeva and Schmidt 2006; Sykorova et al. 2003) or by repeat junction cloning and sequencing (Fajkus et al. 1995; Sykorova et al. 2003). We demonstrated that both CL14 and CL34 repeats locate very close to the telomeric ends of potato chromosomes. At least some of the CL14 and CL34 loci are directly connected with telomeric (TTTAGGG)n repeats (Figure 5). Currently, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional subtelomeric repeats exist in the potato genome. Thus, some of the large gaps between telomere and CL14/CL34 sequences may be occupied with such additional repeats, which may be not as abundant as the CL14/CL34 families and thus were not found in the informatics based survey. Multiple subtelomeric repeats have been reported in some plant species (Brandes et al. 1995; Chen et al. 1997; Dechyeva and Schmidt 2006; Vershinin et al. 1995). Traditional gel blot hybridizations can hardly be used to analyze the organization and relative positions of multiple repeats in a genome. Using a multicolor fiber-FISH approach, we demonstrated that the unrelated CL14 and CL34 repeats are organized into independent but tightly linked arrays. If one of the repeats was derived from the other repeat, and the two repeats had coevolved, then it would be expected to detect intermingled fiber-FISH signals derived from both repeats (Adawy et al. 2004). Fiber-FISH also revealed that the CL34 repeats appear to be always proximal to the telomere when a chromosomal end contains both CL14 and CL34 arrays (Figure 6c). Presence of long arrays of satellite repeats makes it difficult to track the evolution of DNA sequences located in subtelomeric regions. However, the subtelomeric regions contain only single or low copy DNA sequences in some species. The subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes contain a mosaic patchwork of segmentally duplicated DNA blocks that are often present near the ends of multiple chromosomes (Riethman et al. 2005). Some of these segmental duplications contain transcribed genes, thus making the duplications a potential source of phenotypic diversity (Linardopoulou et al. 2005). Extensive studies of subtelomeric sequences in the human genome suggest that these regions are extraordinarily dynamic and are possibly involved in frequent sequence exchanges between ends of nonhomologous chromosomes (Linardopoulou et al. 2005). The subtelomeric regions of A. thaliana chromosomes also lack major satellite repeats. The variation of a 3.5-kb DNA sequence adjacent to the telomere of the short arm of chromosome 1 was studied in 35 A. thaliana accessions (Kuo et al. 2006). This region showed dynamic sequence changes and rearrangements with characteristics of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) events associated with double-strand break (DSB) repair. Such NHEJ events were also detected in the subtelomeric regions of the right arm of chromosome 3 (Wang et al. 2010). Thus, NHEJ events may play an important role in generating the sequence variation associated with the subtelomeric regions of A. thaliana chromosomes. Our comparative FISH analysis of the CL14 and CL34 repeats in a diverse set of Solanum species provide additional strong evidence for the dynamic nature in the subtelomeric regions immediately adjacent to the telomeres. CL14 is an ancient repeat that has maintained its subtelomeric positions in all Solanum species (Figure 7) and its sequence appears to be related to a number of mostly subtelomeric satellite repeat families in Solanum and Nicotiana species. In contrast, CL34, a relatively new repeat, has been amplified in cultivated potato as well as in its most closely relatives. Interestingly, fiber-FISH analysis showed that the CL34 loci are more proximal to the telomeres than CL14 loci on the same chromosome ends (Figure 6c). Thus, the dynamic rearrangements and sequence exchanges between nonhomologous chromosome ends can result in the formation and amplification of new satellite repeat families or in sequence diversification of existing ones as was shown for subtelomeric arrays of VicTR-B satellites in Vicia grandiflora (Macas et al. 2006). High frequency of sequence rearrangements acting close to the telomeres could also explain the observed higher heterogeneity of CL34 monomers compared to CL14 monomers.

In this paper, an integrated view of the pea genetic map was developed. A series of gene markers were mapped and their best reciprocal homologs were identified on M. truncatula, L. japonicus, soybean, and poplar pseudomolecules. Based on the syntenic relationships uncovered between pea and M. truncatula, 5460 pea Unigenes were tentatively placed on the consensus map. A new bioinformatics tool, http://www.thelegumeportal.net/pea_mtr_translational_toolkit, was developed that allows, for any gene sequence, to search its putative position on the pea consensus map and hence to search for candidate genes among neighboring Unigenes. As an example, a promising candidate gene for the hypernodulation mutation nod3 in pea was proposed based on the map position of the likely homolog of Pub1, a M. truncatula gene involved in nodulation regulation. A broader view of pea genome evolution was obtained by revealing syntenic relationships between pea and sequenced genomes. Blocks of synteny were identified which gave new insights into the evolution of chromosome structure in Papillionoids and Eudicots. The power of the translational genomics approach was underlined.Throughout history, navigators and explorers have established and progressively refined maps to discover new locations in the world. Similarly, precise genetic maps are required as a first step to locate and identify major genes as well as quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in traits of interest. Functional genetic maps locate genes involved in physiological processes potentially underlying traits and allow identifying functional and positional candidate genes through translational genomics. Closely related species usually display syntenic regions in their genomes, in which several genes share similar map orders (Young et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2005; Cannon et al. 2006; Tang et al. 2008). Positional candidate genes for QTL or mutations in the crop species can thus be identified in the syntenic regions of model species genomes. In legumes, excellent examples of this strategy are given by the identification of genes involved in the control of N-fixing symbiosis between pea and rhizobia through their Medicago truncatula or Lotus japonicus counterparts (Endre et al. 2002; Krusell et al. 2002; Limpens et al. 2003; L\xc3\xa9vy et al. 2004; Stracke et al. 2004). In order to systematically take advantage of genomic data available in closely related species, a good knowledge of the conservation of genome organization between model and crop species should be gained. The legume family is wide and incredibly diverse (Doyle and Luckow 2003). It includes numerous species that have been part of human diets since the dawn of agriculture and represents a valuable source of dietary proteins, as well as fibers and micronutrients (Grusak 2002; Guillon and Champ 2002; Mitchell et al. 2009). Pea is an important plant protein source in temperate regions of the world (10.4 M tons dry peas produced worldwide in 2009, http://faostat.fao.org/). As for other protein-rich legume crop species, rapid genetic improvement of this species is needed to meet the increasing demand for protein food sources in the world. In the Leguminosae family, total or euchromatic genome sequences are now available for three species. All three species belong to the Papilionoideae subfamily. Medicago truncatula is taxonomically the closest model species to cool-season legume crops such as pea, lentil, faba bean, and chickpea. They belong to the Inverted Repeat Loss Clade of the Hologalegina clade of the Papilionoidae subfamily (Doyle and Luckow 2003). The other legume model species, Lotus japonicus, belongs to the closely related robinioid clade of the Hologalegina clade. The third species is soybean (Glycine max), an economically important crop belonging to the more distant milletioid clade of the Papilionoidae subfamily. Extensive genomics resources are available for the three species and the sequencing of the euchromatic regions of the M. truncatula and L. japonicus genomes is close to completion (Cannon et al. 2006; Sato et al. 2007; Schmutz et al. 2010). Intra- and intergenome comparisons identified syntenic blocks between M. truncatula and L. japonicus genomes and revealed that the three legume genomes hold traces of an ancient whole genome duplication (WGD) that occurred ca. \xe2\x88\xbc59 Mya, probably after the separation of the Fabaceae from Eurosid I group including the Salicaceae (Doyle and Luckow 2003; Young et al. 2005; Cannon et al. 2006), while a more recent WGD occurred in the soybean lineage \xe2\x88\xbc13 Mya (Schmutz et al. 2010). Existing pea linkage maps allowed a draft evaluation of macrosynteny between pea and M. truncatula, L. japonicus, G. max, and other legume linkage maps (Aubert et al. 2006; Kal\xc3\xb3 et al. 2004; Choi et al. 2004) suggesting a significant colinearity among the genomes of these species. In this paper, we established a new pea functional consensus map using recently developed SNP markers. This allowed us to assess in more detail the macrosynteny between pea and the three sequenced legume species by systematically searching for the best reciprocal homologs of pea Unigenes in M. truncatula, L. japonicus and G. max genome databases. We also used the pea genome sequence information to integrate it into previous paleo-genomics analysis in order to unravel the pea evolutionary paleo-history leading to its actual seven-chromosome structure. We used an original and robust method devoted to the identification of orthologous regions between plant genomes as well as for the detection of duplications within genomes based on integrative sequence alignment criteria combined with a statistical validation (Salse et al. 2009a). This method identified seven paleo-duplications in Monocots and Eudicots and allowed proposing a common ancestor with five and seven chromosomes for the Monocots and Eudicots, respectively (Salse et al. 2009b; Abrouk et al. 2010). Finally, taking advantage of the high level of synteny between pea and M. truncatula, we established a pea\xe2\x80\x93M. truncatula translational toolkit allowing for any gene sequence to search its putative position on the pea consensus map, and from a position on the pea consensus map, to search for candidate genes among the neighboring placed Unigenes.'","b""To identify genes involved in phenotypic traits, translational genomics from highly characterized model plants to poorly characterized crop plants provides a valuable source of markers to saturate a zone of interest as well as functionally characterized candidate genes.

In order to increase the number of loci mapped and get more precision about their localization in our consensus map, we used six different recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations (supporting information, Table S1). We used data obtained for three RIL populations previously described: T\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se \xc3\x97 K586 (Pop1, Laucou et al. 1998), T\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se \xc3\x97 Champagne (Pop2, Loridon et al. 2005) and Cam\xc3\xa9or\xc3\x97 China (Pop9, Deulvot et al. 2010). Furthermore, Cameor, VavD265, Ballet, three pea (Pisum sativum L.) lines showing variability in protein content and seed protein composition, were selected to create interconnected RIL populations by single seed descent from the crosses between Cameor \xc3\x97 VavD265 (Pop3, 211 F6:8), Cameor \xc3\x97 Ballet (Pop4, 207 F6:8), Ballet \xc3\x97 VavD265 (Pop5, 211 F6:8). Leaf tissues were harvested from the F6 plant and then from a bulk of eight F7 or F8 plants for further DNA extractions. Total DNA was extracted from leaf tissues according to Dellaporta et al. (1983). A total of 1022 lines were used to build the consensus map. Microsatellite markers (Table S2) were selected based on their polymorphism and map information (Loridon et al. 2005) to build the framework maps of the three new populations. SSR were genotyped as described in Loridon et al. (2005). Moreover, 75 genes already mapped in Pop1, Pop2, Pop9 were genotyped in Pop3, Pop4, and/or Pop5 as gene-anchored bridge markers (Aubert et al. 2006; Deulvot et al. 2010, Table S2) and 34 new gene markers were developed for Pop3, Pop4 or Pop5 and presented in this paper. Additionally, 7 and 14 new gene markers scored in Pop1 (C. Rameau, personal communication) and in Pop2 (I. Lejeune-H\xc3\xa9naut, personal communication) were added on the consensus map. PCR amplifications of the selected genes in parents of mapping populations were carried out as described in Aubert et al. (2006). PCR products were directly sequenced by Millegen (Lab\xc3\xa8ge, France) and polymorphisms were searched. Different types of markers were then designed according to the type of polymorphism identified (INDELs, SNPs or null alleles). Genotyping conditions are summarized in Table S3. Scoring data are available at http://www.thelegumeportal.net/pea_genotype_scores. A map was built for each RIL population as described in Aubert et al. (2006). Then, the consensus map was developed for the six populations (Pop1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9). Population data were merged and the consensus map was built using CarthaGene (De Givry et al. 2005). The inherent difficulty of defining groups for such a large dataset was overcome by analyzing groups obtained with increasing LOD scores, from 15 to 30, using a maximum distance criterion of 30 cM. Then, markers were added to the consensus map on the basis of their relative position to common markers shared by at least two RIL populations. The map order was refined using the annealing and flips procedures of CarthaGene. The best map obtained, (i.e., the map presenting the maximum log-likelihood and minimum length) was finally drawn using MapChart version 2.1 software (Voorrips 2002). In order to enhance the comparative mapping and assess the conservation of synteny between the P. sativum and M. truncatula, L. japonicus, soybean, and poplar genomes, we searched for the best reciprocal homologs of all pea gene sequences available in predicted gene sequences of the genomes of the four species. 30156 pea sequences were retrieved from public databases on January 27th 2010: 2227 pea CDS from public EMBLCDS database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/- ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/embl/cds), 18552 pea EST from GenBank (dbEST), and 9377 pea EST from IPK Gatersleben (www.ipk-gatersleben.de/). Repetitive elements were masked with Repeat Masker (Smit AFA, Hubley R & Green P. /RepeatMasker Open-3.0/. 1996-2010 [http://www.repeatmasker.org]) with the parameter \xe2\x80\x9c-species = fabaceae\xe2\x80\x9d to mask both common (176) and fabaceae specific (291) repetitive elements. Low complexity regions like poly-A tails or other low quality ends were trimmed with SeqClean (Pertea et al. 2003). Unexpected vector sequences were removed with Seqclean using NCBI's Univec database. All the sequences under 100 bp were removed. Sequence cleaning and contig clustering were processed with EST2Uni package (Forment et al. 2008). Clustering has been done with the TIGR Gene Indices clustering tools (Pertea et al. 2003) software (TGICL) using CAP3 assembly program (Huang and Madan, 1999) with a minimum percent identity for overlaps of 95% for both programs (parameters: 'O \xe2\x80\x9cp95\xe2\x80\x9d -p 95 -n 16000'; default values: -O \xe2\x80\x9cp93\xe2\x80\x9d -p 94 -v 30 -n 1000). The annotation of the resulting Unigenes (contigs and singletons) was made based on homology to known sequences using BLASTN or tBLASTn. The e-value threshold was 1e\xe2\x88\x9215 with a minimum identity percentage of 70%. The Unigenes were blasted against two databases in the following order: 1) the UniprotKB/Swissprot database (v57.9), 2) the predicted genes from release 3 (IMGA-gene-v3) of the Medicago Genome Sequence Consortium (MGSC) (Cannon et al. 2006), 3) and the M. truncatula Gene Index release 9 (MtGI9) from TIGR. Annotation was characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cvery similar\xe2\x80\x9d if the e-value was below 1e-20 and \xe2\x80\x9chighly similar\xe2\x80\x9d below 1e\xe2\x88\x9250. The search for putative orthologs of pea genes in M. truncatula was carried out by performing reciprocal BLASTs between the Unigenes and the M. truncatula sequence database containing the sequences of IMGA-gene-v3, MtGI9, and those of the BACs release 3 from MGSC. The threshold e-value was 1e\xe2\x88\x9220 for both BLASTN. If for a given Unigene the best hit was a Medicago gene predicted sequence from IMGA-gene-v3, or an EST contig from MtGI9, a reciprocal BLASTN was performed on the pea database. If the best hit was a BAC sequence, a reciprocal BLASTN was done between a sequence containing the matching zone plus 2 kb at both 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 side of the matched sequence. The best reciprocal homologs were searched using a perl script (File S1). If the best hit was the original sequence of the pea Unigene, the Medicago gene sequence was considered as the best reciprocal homolog of that pea sequence. Then, the positions of the best reciprocal homologs of pea Unigenes were searched using M. truncatula gene position data from the genome assembly v3 of the MGSC (http://www.medicago.org/). If the best reciprocal homolog was a BAC sequence or a predicted gene from IMGA-gene-v3, the position was given by its position on the pseudo-chromosome. If the best hit was a TC from TIGR, the position was obtained, if possible, by finding the best homolog among the predicted genes from IMGA-gene-v3 and retrieving the predicted gene position on the pseudo-chromosome. The search for putative orthologs of pea genes in L. japonicus, soybean (G. max), and poplar (P. trichocarpa) was achieved by reciprocal BLASTs as described for M. truncatula, except that only publicly available predicted gene sequences for these species were used. For L. japonicus, we used coding sequences from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus). For G. max, high confidence protein-coding sequences from the soybean genome were used (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean). For P. trichocarpa, the coding sequences were retrieved from the sequences of the P. trichocarpa sequencing project (http://www.phytozome.net/poplar). Finally, we compared the position of best reciprocal homologs on the pea consensus map on the one hand, and on the M. truncatula, L. japonicus, soybean and poplar pseudo-chromosomes on the other hand, using dot-plots and comparative maps. The dot-plots were built using Excel. The grape, Arabidopsis, Medicago, Lotus, soybean, poplar, and papaya sequence databases (http://www.phytozome.org/, Abrouk et al. 2010) were used to perform a synteny analysis using three parameters recently defined by Salse et al. (2009a). These parameters increase the stringency and significance of BLAST sequence alignment by parsing BLASTX results and rebuilding HSPs (High Scoring Pairs) or pairwise sequence alignments to identify accurate paralogous and orthologous relationships. This analysis allowed searching for traces of Eudicot paleo-duplication in the pea genome. The \xe2\x80\x9cPea_Medicago_translational_toolkit\xe2\x80\x9d is a cgi/perl webpage hosted on an Apache webserver (http://www.thelegumeportal.net/pea_mtr_translational_toolkit). This toolkit allows two actions: 1) searching for the putative position of a gene on the pea consensus map and 2) searching for putative candidate genes in the neighborhood of a pea genetic locus. When searching for putative gene position, the user inputs a pea sequence in the dedicated box, this sequence is BLASTed against the pea Unigene database at 1e\xe2\x88\x9220 threshold, and the positions of the five best hits, if any, are displayed. These positions are inferred from the positions of Medicago best homologs of all pea Unigenes on M. truncatula pseudo-chromosomes relatively to Medicago best reciprocal homologs of the pea marker genes. When searching positional candidate genes at a locus, the user inputs either one or two pea markers, or a position in cM on the pea consensus map. The output is a list of Unigenes putatively located near the markers or the position entered by the user. The map presented in Figure 1 results from a consensus mapping procedure for six different recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations (Table S1). Four new mapping populations were added to the ones used for the previous pea functional map (Aubert et al. 2006). Microsatellite and gene markers were mapped in populations Pop3, Pop4, and Pop5, and only gene markers were mapped in Pop9 (Deulvot et al. 2010). Three genomic regions displayed marker segregation distortion (Table S4): between AB33 and Gibbi on the top of LGII in Pop3 and Pop9, near Le at the bottom of LGIII in Pop5, and between AC10_1 and AD60 on LGVI in Pop3. The small distorted area found in Pop5 next to Le is probably due to the effect of this developmental gene driving seed number per plant (Burstin et al. 2007). As described in Loridon et al. (2005) and Aubert et al. (2006), marker ranks and positions were generally consistent across populations, except local rearrangements (at the top of LGI in Pop5, C20b, Agps2, AA228 and Nin are reversed; in the middle of LGII in Pop4 and of LGIII in Pop3, very close markers are reversed). The new Pisum sativum L. consensus functional map. Gene markers are in bold on the right of linkage groups. Known mutations and protein or gene markers placed according to previous maps (Laucou et al. 1998; Hall et al. 1997; Weeden et al. 1998; Ellis and Poyser 2002; Wang et al. 2008; Sinjushin et al. 2006; Mishra et al. 2009; Li et al. 2010) are in bold on the left of linkage groups. Known mutations are in blue type. *Mendel\xe2\x80\x99s genes. Then, the consensus map was built using bridge markers as framework markers (Table 1, Table S2). Out of the 536 markers placed on the consensus map, 56% were genotyped in at least two mapping populations, and between 16 and 154 markers were shared per pair of RIL populations (Table 1). The new consensus functional map covers 1389 cM with 97% of marker intervals below 10 cM. This map includes 3 morphological markers, 180 SSR markers, 133 RAPD, 6 RFLP, and 214 gene-based markers belonging to different functional classes (see Table S3). Fifty-one new genes were mapped in the present study and added to gene markers previously published in Aubert et al. (2006) and Deulvot et al. (2010). This map has the advantage of incorporating markers used for different published maps (Weeden et al. 1998, Laucou et al. 1998; Choi et al. 2004, Loridon et al. 2005; Aubert et al. 2006; Jing et al. 2007; Prioul-Gervais et al. 2007). These links allowed us to tentatively place 48 known mutations and 15 protein or gene markers on the consensus map (Hall et al. 1997; Weeden et al. 1998; Rameau et al. 1998; Ellis and Poyser 2002; Hecht et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2008; Mishra et al. 2009; Sinjushin et al. 2006; Katoch et al. 2009; Li et al. 2010) (Figure 1). A total of 70 known mutations were placed on the map (Figure 1) including the 48 above-mentioned mutations and 22 mutations corresponding to mapped genes. From 30,156 pea sequences retrieved from public databases, 541 have been removed and 13,381 have been trimmed after cleaning and low complexity region removal, leading to 29,615 high quality sequences. Sequences ranged from 101 to 6789 bp and had a mean length of 623 bp. The mean expressed sequence tag (EST) length was 520 bp, and the mean gene coding sequence (CDS) length was 1188 bp. The clustering produced 13,747 Unigenes: 4792 contigs and 8955 singletons. Contigs had an average length of 807 bp and an average depth of 4.3 sequences: about half of the contigs (2397) were made of two sequences, and 14% (678) were made of more than five sequences. Singletons had an average length of 525 bp. Surprisingly, 4% of singletons (346) were CDS but had no corresponding EST. A total of 10,416 (75%) of the Unigenes were annotated: 2993 with Swissprot database, 852 with Uniprot database and the remainder with the composite M. truncatula database. As expected, the deepest contigs, including most of ESTs, were found for the 26S ribosomal RNA, provicilin and legumin A genes. In the search for putative Medicago orthologs, pea Unigenes were BLASTed on IMGA predicted genes, TIGR TC and BAC sequences (Table 2). Out of the 13,747 pea Unigene sequences, 11,166 (81%) had a unidirectional match under defined conditions and 8375 (61%) had a reciprocal best hit with the starting Unigene. Out of these 8375 best bidirectional homolog sequences, 5460 could be placed on the M. truncatula pseudo-chromosomes. Out of the 214 gene-based markers located on the new consensus map, 121 had a best reciprocal M. truncatula homolog and 19 had been defined directly from M. truncatula sequences. In total, 140 sequences corresponding to pea gene markers could be placed on the M. truncatula genome. This represents a substantial increase in the number of pea\xe2\x80\x93M. truncatula bridges compared with Aubert et al. (2006) and Choi et al. (2004), who reported 45 and 57 links, respectively, and allowed a more precise assessment of synteny (Figure 2, Figure S1). Dot-plots of syntenic relationships between the P. sativum linkage groups (LG) and M. truncatula (a), L. japonicus (b), G. max (c), and P. trichocarpa (d) pseudo-chromosomes. The best reciprocal homologs are placed on the dot-plot according to their position on the pea LG (Y-axis) and their position on the pseudo-chromosomes (x-axis). Synteny conservation is evidenced when homologs symbols are placed on diagonal lines. Rearrangements are circled. Syntenic blocks are highlighted according to pea LG (blue diamonds: gene mapped on PsI; yellow squares: PsII; green triangles: PsIII; pink squares: PsIV; red diamonds: PsV; purple circles: PsVI; pink triangles: LGVII); symbols are color-coded when at least three best reciprocal homologs are found between a pea LG and M. truncatula, L .japonicus, G. max, or P. trichocarpa pseudo-chromosomes. A simpler method was used for searching the best reciprocal homolog in L. japonicus, soybean and poplar, where only predicted gene sequences were taken into account. Best reciprocal homologs were identified to pea Unigenes, and 76, 151, and 98 were placed on the L. japonicus, soybean, and poplar genomes, respectively (Table 3). Dotplots (Figure 2) and the summary view of the chromosome relationships among the five species (Figure 3) illustrate the varying levels of conserved macrosynteny between pea and the four species analyzed. For all pea linkage groups, clear blocks of synteny linked pea and M. truncatula genomes with varying levels of rearrangements among the syntenic blocks. Pea linkage group I (PsI) is related to M. truncatula chromosome 5 (Mt5), with a small inversion of gene order in the middle, like PsIV with Mt8. PsII is related to Mt1 with an inversion at the top of PsII, and PsIII is related both to Mt2 and Mt3 with minor rearrangement along the synteny block, like PsVII with Mt4. To a lesser extent, the conservation of synteny is also striking with L. japonicus and soybean. For all pea linkage groups except PsVI, blocks of synteny could be identified with L. japonicus, with a few rearrangements (e.g., the inversions in the middle of the group for PsI and PsII). As expected, synteny was more fragmented with soybean. However, clear blocks of synteny can be identified for all pea linkage groups, with from one to four syntenic blocks in soybean for each pea linkage group. Long segments of colinearity were conserved, as for example between PsV and Gm9 and 19, or PsVII with Gm11. In contrast, no clear pattern of synteny emerges from the dot-plot between pea and P. trichocarpa chromosomes. Comparative maps allow a closer look at the conservation of synteny blocks. Figure 4 shows syntenic regions for PsIII and PsV. While for PsV, synteny encompasses the whole linkage group, for PsIII, intra- and interchromosome rearrangements increase complexity. The pea\xe2\x80\x93M. truncatula comparative maps (Figure S1) also inform about variations in genetic and genomic distances: for example, the longer Mt5 pseudo-molecule (42.8 Mb) corresponds to the smaller pea linkage group (PsI, 142.4 cM), suggesting a restriction of recombination for this pea chromosome. Summary view of P. sativum, M. truncatula, L. japonicus, soybean (G. max), and poplar (P. trichocarpa) genomes, phylogenetic relationships, and molecular characteristics. Genomes are depicted through best reciprocal homogue genes, color-coded and numbered according to the position of the P. sativum homolog on linkage groups of the consensus functional map. Comparative maps between P. sativum and M. truncatula, L. japonicus, soybean for (A) LGII and (B) LGV. Using the alignment parameters and statistical tests described previously by Salse et al. (2009a,b), we analyzed the syntenic relationships between pea, grape, Arabidopsis, Medicago, Lotus, soybean, poplar, and papaya genomes. Using grape as the reference genome, 149 robust orthologous relationships have been identified covering 37% of the pea map. Integration of the synteny relationships established independently between pea and the seven Eudicot sequenced genomes led to the precise characterization, in pea, of the seven paleo-triplications proposed recently as the basis of the definition of seven ancestral chromosomal groups in Eudicots (Abrouk et al. 2010). The putative origin of shared ancestral duplications found in pea, are shown on Figure 5 using a seven color code indicating the seven common ancestor chromosomes of Eudicots. In pea, the seven ancestral shared triplications proposed recently in Eudicots (Abrouk et al. 2010) are thus characterized for the first time in the present paper. Based on the ancestral (\xce\xb3) as well as the lineage specific (\xce\xb1, \xce\xb2) whole genome duplications reported for the Eudicots, it becomes possible to propose an evolutionary scenario that has shaped the seven pea chromosomes from the seven chromosome Eudicot ancestor and more specifically from the 21 paleo-hexaploid intermediate (Figure 5). We suggest from the 21 chromosome-intermediate ancestor at least 25 major chromosome fusions (CF) to obtain the current seven chromosome structure (Figure 5). Pea genome paleo-history. The pea genome (bottom) is represented with a seven-color code to illuminate the evolution of segments from a common ancestor with seven chromosomes (A1\xe2\x80\x93A7, top). Colored lines indicate the evolution of segments from a seven-chromosome common ancestor of the Eudicots to reach the modern pea genome structure. The 25 chromosomal fusions (CF) are highlighted with colored arrows. At the bottom of the figure is shown the actual pea genome structure. The ancestral shared duplications can be compared with the seven ancestral paleo-triplications reported in grape (Vitis vinifera, Abrouk et al. 2010): V. vinifera chromosomes are indicated by Vv, P. sativum linkage groups by Ps. 1Vv1-Vv14-Vv17/ PsIII-PsIV-PsV-PsVI-PsVII (yellow), Vv2-Vv12-Vv15-Vv16/PsI-PsII-PsV-PsVII (blue), Vv3-Vv4-Vv7-Vv18/PsI-PsII-PsIII-PsVII (green), Vv4-Vv9-Vv11/PsII-PsIII-PsIV-PsVI (light blue), Vv5-Vv7-Vv14/PsII-PsV (pink), Vv6-Vv8-Vv13/PsII-PsV-PsVII (brown), Vv10-Vv12-Vv19/PsI-PsIII-PsIV-PsVI-PsVII (red). Because the conservation of gene colinearity was generally good between pea and M. truncatula, we designed a Pea-Medicago translational toolkit based on their comparative map. If one wants to locate a gene sequence on the pea consensus map, one can enter the nucleic acid sequence of interest; this sequence will be BLASTed onto our Unigene database, andits position on the pea consensus map will be inferred from the position of this gene\xe2\x80\x99s best homolog on the M. truncatula chromosomes. A reverse way to use this translational toolkit is to search the Unigene database for putative candidate genes in the neighborhood of a pea genetic locus of interest to the user. Of course, the validity of the predicted position will be more reliable in regions where pea\xe2\x80\x93M. truncatula colinearity is good. It depends also on the type of gene investigated and the possibility to find the best homologs in our pea Unigene database. The translational toolkit provides a worked example. Other tools investigate synteny among legume species (Legume Information System at http://www.comparative-legumes.org/ or the Medicago truncatula GBrowse at http://medtr.comparative-legumes.org/gb2/gbrowse/3.5.1/). Our tool has the advantage to allow for any sequence of interest, the search of its putative position on the pea map. Pisum sativum has been a case study for geneticists since Mendel\xe2\x80\x99s pioneering studies. Since then, significant efforts have been put into the development of genetic maps for this species (Weeden et al. 1998; Ellis and Poyser 2002; Aubert et al. 2006). Many mutations have been described in pea. In 1972, Blixt (1972) published a mutation map including 169 morphological markers. Some gene markers of the present consensus map correspond to known mutations e.g., the A, I, Le and R genes studied by Mendel. Other previously published mutations were placed on the functional map (Figure 1) by using bridge markers. The underlying genes responsible for many mutant phenotypes are still unknown. Our translational toolkit may help researchers 1) to find candidate genes for traits of interest, whether in pea or in a related species for which syntenic regions are identified, or 2) to define well-located gene markers in the vicinity of the gene or QTL they want to identify. For example, a root-expressed E3 ubiquitin ligase gene (PUB1) was recently shown to negatively regulate nodulation in Medicago truncatula (Mbengue et al. 2010). The translational toolkit enabled us to place Pub1\xe2\x80\x99s closest pea homolog on the top of pea LGI, in the region of a hypernodulation mutant, Nod3 (Gualtieri et al. 2002). This makes the pea ortholog of Pub1 a very good candidate for Nod3. In this paper, we present the new consensus linkage map of P. sativum including 214 functional markers. Diverse functional classes are represented: development, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, transport, transcriptional regulation (Table S2). Because transcription factors (TF) are important key regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes and particularly seed storage protein gene expression (Meinke et al. 1981, Gatehouse et al. 1982), we mapped putative TF genes selected by homology to M. truncatula, Arabidopsis thaliana, or maize TF sequences. An OPAQUE2-LIKE gene was located on P. sativum LGII (PsII). In cereals, OPAQUE2 gene encodes a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that binds to a promoter element in the 22-kD zein genes to activate their expression (Schmidt et al. 1990, 1992; Ueda et al. 1992). Coincidentally, a legumin gene cluster was mapped in this region (Hall et al. 1997) as well as Vpe, a gene encoding for a protein involved in the maturation of storage proteins, RNApol2 which encodes for an RNA polymerase, and PsDof7 another transcription factor. ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) is also a seed-specific TF that has key regulatory functions during seed development, particularly in the expression of seed storage protein genes (Parcy et al. 1997; Kroj et al. 2003; M\xc3\xb6nke et al. 2004) and acts in synergy with other bZIP factors (Lara et al. 2003). Abi3 was mapped on LGV near four other TF genes: ColA, ArfB3, Aux1, and Tir1, and close to a previously mapped vicilin gene cluster (Hall et al. 1997). The genetic clustering of potentially interacting genes could favor their optimal interaction. Altogether, the functional markers located on this map might be good candidates for seed traits in pea and should be tested for their colocation with seed productivity and quality trait QTL. As in our previous work (Loridon et al. 2005; Aubert et al. 2006), we privileged easily transferable markers to allow their wide use both by academics and breeders. In legumes, early studies reported colinearity among cool-season legume linkage maps (pea and lentil: Weeden et al. 1992, pea and chickpea: Simon and Muehibauer 1997). Since then, other studies have reported a high level of macrosynteny between the pea and Medicago genomes (Aubert et al. 2006; Choi et al. 2004; Kal\xc3\xb3 et al. 2004) as well as among several legume species (Choi et al. 2004; Zhu et al. 2006). With the advent of whole genome sequences, syntenic relationships can be revisited in a more detailed way in order to identify candidate genes in sequenced species for traits in crop species. In the present study, pea was put at the center of a search for syntenic relationship with fou",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 other species, from the closely related M. truncatula to the more distant P. trichocarpa. As summarized in Figure 3, the five species not only differ in their level of phylogenetic relatedness, but also in their genome size and chromosome numbers. The genome size difference is 10-fold from L. japonicus and M. truncatula small genomes (ca. 500 Mb, Sato et al. 2010), through soybean (ca. 1100 Mb, Schmutz et al. 2010), to pea (ca. 5000 Mb, Ellis and Poyser 2002). While soybean genome has undergone a recent whole genome duplication (WGD) event (ca. 13 Mya, Schmutz et al. 2010), the pea genome is probably the richest in retro-transposons (Ellis and Poyser 2002, Macas et al. 2007). Despite these marked differences, a striking conservation of gene synteny and gene order was shown in this study. Identifying and aligning the best-in-genome homologous sequences provided a clearer picture of syntenic relationships. The highest rate of best reciprocal homolog identification for the 13,747 pea Unigenes was found for soybean (6626 putative orthologs identified, Table 3) for which close to 100% of the genome sequence is available. The second highest score was for M. truncatula, the closest species to pea but for which only \xe2\x88\xbc60% of the genome is covered by available sequences. The estimated number of pea Unigenes for which a putative ortholog could be expected to be found in the four other species, if 100% of the genome sequence was available (Table 3), was closely related to the phylogenetic relatedness among species, with the highest expected rate of ortholog discovery for M. truncatula (71%), then L. japonicus (60%), soybean (49%), and finally P. trichocarpa (22%). Similarly, decreasing levels of colinearity were correlated with higher phylogenetic distances (Figure 3). Despite the recent WGD having occurred in the soybean lineage, clear traces of synteny and coancestry were seen between the pea and soybean genomes. And although overall synteny is blurred with P. trichocarpa, some interesting relics merit further inspection. A few markers broke the synteny (Figures 2 and 3). It may be that the best reciprocal homolog found in the genome of the sequenced species is not the ortholog, as the Medicago and Lotus genome sequencing are still in progress. Other possible sources of synteny breakage are gene translocation, for example following a transposition event, or ortholog gene loss making paralogs appear as best reciprocal homologs. Finally, regarding marker order rearrangements, it should be noted that the consensus map is the best statistical model obtained, but errors in marker ordering can be generated following the merge of data from different populations due to 1) translocation events as commonly reported in different pea stocks (Ellis and Poyser 2002) and 2) missing data for markers genotyped in some populations and not others, depending on their polymorphism. Finally, this pea functional consensus map also provides a platform tool for converting markers from pea to allied species for which few functional markers are available. Through the use of M. truncatula as bridge species, our data relates to recent publications on lentil (Phan et al. 2006), white clover (George et al. 2008), Phaseolus vulgaris (McClean et al. 2010; Galeano et al. 2009; Hougaard et al. 2008), and chickpea (Nayak et al. 2010). By increasing the number of mapped genes on the pea functional map, this study also significantly increased the number of bridge markers to the sequenced genomes. This allowed to put forward some hypotheses as regards to the ancient Papillionoid or Eurosid I chromosomes. The structure of the proto-papillionoid chromosome seems generally to be retained, with a few deviations. The most puzzling case involves PsIII and PsVI. When comparing pea and M. truncatula, it appears that PsIII is split in two in M. truncatula: orthologs of genes located on PsIII (Figure 3) and PsVI are found in Mt2. In L. japonicus, some PsIII gene orthologs are associated with PsVI gene orthologs to form part of Lj3. In G. max, some PsIII gene orthologs are associated with PsVI gene orthologs in Gm4,6,12, and 15. Finally, even in P. trichocarpa, some gene orthologs of PsIII and PsVI are merged for example in Pt15. Thus, it appears that PsIII and PsVI could have been part of a same chromosome before the radiation between the Leguminosae and the other Eurosid I including the Salicaceae. Two duplicated genes give another view of PsIII and PsVI evolution: while PsAAP1 (#71 in Figure 3) and PsAAP2 (#69) are located in neighboring positions on PsIII probably following a tandem duplication (Tegeder et al. 2000), the PGK1 (#92) and PGK2 (#182) genes (Aubert et al. 2006) are mapped on PsIII and PsVI. In order to further unravel the pea genome paleo-history, we identified and characterized shared paleo-duplications based on the integration of orthologous relationships identified between the 7 pea chromosomes and the grape, Arabidopsis, Medicago, Lotus, soybean, poplar and papaya genomes. We proposed an evolutionary scenario that may have shaped the seven pea chromosomes from a seven chromosome paleo-hexaploid Eudicot ancestor (Abrouk et al. 2010). Under this hypothesis, the pea genome underwent at least one triplication event and 25 chromosome fusions (Figure 5). Interestingly, the two shorter linkage groups correspond to chromosomes having experienced few chromosomal fusion events (three for PsI and two for PsVI) during evolution, while longer linkage groups correspond to chromosomes having experienced more fusions (at least six for PsIII and four for PsV), suggesting a link between genome evolution and recombination distribution. This approach also allowed defining potential paralogous regions in the genome. For example, PsIV and PsVI are likely to share paralogous genes resulting from ancestral triplication in the eudicot ancestor. Finally, compared with the other Eudicots analyzed, pea appears to have evolved a simple genome structure, intermediate between the grape (with an ancestral-type modern genome structure) and soybean (with an intensively rearranged modern genome structure). This approach may be of general interest to identify regions potentially carrying ancient paralog genes. In conclusion, the new consensus functional map of pea presented herein represents a significant step toward a better understanding of legume evolution of genomes and traits. Legumes are fascinating plants, establishing vital symbiosis with soil microflora, developing highly nutritive seeds, and showing an astonishing diversity of forms. Among these species, pea has a special historical interest and its genome seems to have retained a large part of the ancestral papillionoideae chromosome structure. It is thus urgent to develop more genomic resources for this species, an effort that is currently underway in different ongoing projects throughout the world. We thank P.

3,"['Laura M. Vaughn', 'Patrick H. Masson']","July 11, 2011.",A QTL Study for Regions Contributing to Arabidopsis thaliana Root Skewing on Tilted Surfaces,"b'Plant root systems must grow in a manner that is dictated by endogenous genetic pathways, yet sensitive to environmental input. This allows them to provide the plant with water and nutrients while navigating a heterogeneous soil environment filled with obstacles, toxins, and pests. Gravity and touch, which constitute important cues for roots growing in soil, have been shown to modulate root architecture by altering growth patterns. This is illustrated by Arabidopsis thaliana roots growing on tilted hard agar surfaces. Under these conditions, the roots are exposed to both gravity and touch stimulation. Consequently, they tend to skew their growth away from the vertical and wave along the surface. This complex growth behavior is believed to help roots avoid obstacles in nature. Interestingly, A. thaliana accessions display distinct growth patterns under these conditions, suggesting the possibility of using this variation as a tool to identify the molecular mechanisms that modulate root behavior in response to their mechanical environment. We have used the Cvi/Ler recombinant inbred line population to identify quantitative trait loci that contribute to root skewing on tilted hard agar surfaces. A combination of fine mapping for one of these QTL and microarray analysis of expression differences between Cvi and Ler root tips identifies a region on chromosome 2 as contributing to root skewing on tilted surfaces, potentially by modulating cell wall composition.Healthy roots take on an architecture that securely anchors the plant in soil and allows for dynamic growth toward adequate water and nutrients. The heterogeneous nature of soil leads to gradients in elements that the plant may need to acquire or avoid, and obstacles such as rocks must be bypassed to continue a downward trajectory. These environmental inputs combine with intrinsic developmental cues to determine root growth behavior. Understanding the genetics behind primary root elongation and how it is affected by various environmental stimuli may help in the breeding of crops better suited to their local soil conditions. A common way to observe root growth behavior is to germinate seedlings on a hard agar surface in a petri dish. The root is more easily observed than it would be in a soil environment, and the hard surface provides an obstacle as the roots grow along it, similar to that which a rock may present to a root in its natural environment. Also, if the plate is tilted back, the root tip will attempt to grow downward along the gravity vector. However, the hard medium is impenetrable, therefore, gravitropism will press the root tip against the agar causing stronger touch stimulus. The combined effect of gravity and touch stimuli on the root tip, along with other surface-derived stimuli and intrinsic cell machinery, cause characteristic root growth behaviors under these conditions (Okada and Shimura 1990; Rutherford and Masson 1996, Simmons et al. 1996). One such behavior is root skewing or slanting, whereby roots tend to deviate their growth progressively away from the gravity vector, always in the same direction (typically rightward, when viewed from the back of the plate, through the agar). Rightward skewing is often accompanied by a left-handed rotation of the root tip about its axis, visible as a left-handed rotation of the epidermal cell files. The degree of skewing varies in wild-type roots of Arabidopsis thaliana, with some accessions showing little or none and others displaying a distinct rightward skew on tilted surfaces (Simmons et al.1995; Rutherford and Masson 1996). Mutants have been discovered that have enhanced right skew or a pronounced leftward skew, the latter of which has never been seen in a wild type A. thaliana accession. Often, these skewing mutants display epidermal cell file rotations (CFR), the degree of which correlates with the level of skewing. The handedness of the CFR also correlates with the direction of skewing: left- handed CFR for rightward skewing and right-handed CFR for leftward skewing (Rutherford and Masson 1996; Furutani et al. 2000; Whittington et al. 2001; Sedbrook et al. 2002; Thitamadee et al. 2002; Yuen et al. 2003; Ishida et al. 2007; Korolev et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2007; Bisgrove et al. 2008; Nakamura and Hashimoto 2009). However, this correlation between CFR, and level of skewing is not observed in all mutants. For instance, the spr2 mutant has a strong helical growth phenotype, yet its epidermal cell file rotation remains wild-type (Furutani et al. 2000). Many skewing mutants also have abnormal cortical microtubule arrays. In wild-type A. thaliana interphase cells in the epidermal and lateral cap layers of the root elongation zone, cortical microtubules are arranged mostly in a transverse orientation. This arrangement correlates with the cells in this region expanding anisotropically, in a direction perpendicular to the transverse arrays (reviewed in Harrison et al. 2008). When the cells approach the shootward portion of the elongation zone (as defined in Baskin et al. 2010), the cortical arrays will briefly shift to oblique right-handed helical arrangements. A left-handed cell file rotation is often visible at this region of the root, corresponding to the right-handed arrays (Okada and Shimura, 1990; Rutherford and Masson, 1996). As the cells continue to the maturation zone, the arrays shift again, this time to form a mostly longitudinal network. Finally, the microtubules become disorganized as the cell stops elongating (Sugimoto et al. 2000). Several skewing mutants have cortical microtubule arrays that fall into helical patterns before reaching the basal side of the elongation zone, the handedness of which correlates to the handedness of the skewing. As with CFR correlations, not all skewing mutants have altered cortical microtubule arrays, including spr2 as well as eb1 and spr1 (Furutani et al. 2000; Sedbrook et al. 2004; Bisgrove et al. 2008). Furthermore, altered arrays in root slanting mutants are not always found in the form of helical patterns. In some cases, arrays are simply disorganized (Bichet et al. 2001; Whittington et al. 2001; Burk and Ye 2002; Webb et al. 2002; Bouquin et al., 2003). Most skewing mutants found to date have changes in tubulin genes or in genes that produce microtubule-associated proteins. These studies have shown that changes in the structure of \xce\xb1-, \xce\xb2-, and \xce\xb3- tubulin subunits can affect microtubule assembly and cause helical root growth behavior, often accompanied by abnormal helical microtubule arrays (Thitamadee et al. 2002; Pastuglia et al. 2006; Ishida et al. 2007; Buschmann et al. 2009). Also, changes in proteins that regulate microtubule polymerization, bundling, and severing can alter the organization and dynamic instability of microtubules and lead to changes in root skewing (reviewed in Sedbrook and Kaloriti 2008; Wasteneys and Ambrose 2009). A few skewing mutants have been discovered that do not directly affect microtubules, but instead are predicted to have an impact on cell wall composition or signaling cascades that contribute to proper anisotropic cell expansion during root growth (Sedbrook et al. 2002; Hu et al. 2003; Yuen et al. 2005). In addition to skewing, roots may exhibit waving behavior when grown on hard surfaces. This behavior is common to many plants exposed to tilted hard surfaces and has been studied by several scientists over the years, including Charles Darwin (reviewed in Vaughn et al. 2010; Darwin and Darwin 1880). In this complex manner of growth, the root tip changes direction at regular intervals as it elongates on the surface, producing a sinusoidal wave pattern along the root\xe2\x80\x99s length. The waving pattern may include alternating left- and right-handed epidermal cell file rotation, at least under some conditions (Buer et al. 2003). Several models have been proposed to explain wavy growth, but in general it is agreed to be a consequence of gravitropism, thigmotropism, intrinsic cellular programs, and possibly other stimuli. The behavior may be important for roots trying to navigate through various soil microenvironments (Okada and Shimura 1990; Simmons et al.1995; Rutherford and Masson 1996; Migliaccio and Piconese 2001; Buer et al. 2003; Thompson and Holbrook 2004). As with skewing, mutants have been identified that display altered waving behavior. Studies of these mutants have highlighted the importance of signaling by the hormones auxin and ethylene as well as other molecules like small peptides in regulating the behavior (reviewed in Migliaccio and Piconese 2001; Oliva and Dunand, 2007). While mutants have been helpful in elucidating the genetics behind the root growth behaviors on hard surfaces, our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these complex growth responses remain rudimentary. Another way to gain new insights into root growth patterns is to use the natural variation that exists among members of plant species. Variation among the A. thaliana accessions Columbia, Landsberg erecta, and Wassilewskija for skewing has already been noted (Simmons et al. 1996). Also, we know that defined genetic backgrounds modify waving because in at least one case the same mutant allele (spr1/sku6) results in distinct phenotypes when introgressed into different genetic backgrounds (Sedbrook et al. 2004). In this study, we used a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population created from the A. thaliana accessions Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) (Alonso-Blanco et al. 1998) for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of root growth behaviors on agar surfaces. Our results suggest that a region on chromosome 2 is contributing the most to the difference in skewing between these accessions, although other loci are also implicated. No loci in the candidate region have previously been associated with root skewing. We also performed a microarray analysis using Cvi and Ler root tips from seedlings grown on tilted hard agar to identify genes with differing expression between these accessions in genomic locations that overlap with the QTL, leading to interesting candidate loci between 9.3 and 11.2 Mb on chromosome 2.'","b'Plant root systems must grow in a manner that is dictated by endogenous genetic pathways, yet sensitive to environmental input. This allows them to provide the plant with water and nutrients while navigating a heterogeneous soil environment filled with obstacles, toxins, and pests. Gravity and touch, which constitute important cues for roots growing in soil, have been shown to modulate root architecture by altering growth patterns. This is illustrated by Arabidopsis thaliana roots growing on tilted hard agar surfaces. Under these conditions, the roots are exposed to both gravity and touch stimulation. Consequently, they tend to skew their growth away from the vertical and wave along the surface. This complex growth behavior is believed to help roots avoid obstacles in nature. Interestingly, A. thaliana accessions display distinct growth patterns under these conditions, suggesting the possibility of using this variation as a tool to identify the molecular mechanisms that modulate root behavior in response to their mechanical environment. We have used the Cvi/Ler recombinant inbred line population to identify quantitative trait loci that contribute to root skewing on tilted hard agar surfaces. A combination of fine mapping for one of these QTL and microarray analysis of expression differences between Cvi and Ler root tips identifies a region on chromosome 2 as contributing to root skewing on tilted surfaces, potentially by modulating cell wall composition. Healthy roots take on an architecture that securely anchors the plant in soil and allows for dynamic growth toward adequate water and nutrients. The heterogeneous nature of soil leads to gradients in elements that the plant may need to acquire or avoid, and obstacles such as rocks must be bypassed to continue a downward trajectory. These environmental inputs combine with intrinsic developmental cues to determine root growth behavior. Understanding the genetics behind primary root elongation and how it is affected by various environmental stimuli may help in the breeding of crops better suited to their local soil conditions. A common way to observe root growth behavior is to germinate seedlings on a hard agar surface in a petri dish. The root is more easily observed than it would be in a soil environment, and the hard surface provides an obstacle as the roots grow along it, similar to that which a rock may present to a root in its natural environment. Also, if the plate is tilted back, the root tip will attempt to grow downward along the gravity vector. However, the hard medium is impenetrable, therefore, gravitropism will press the root tip against the agar causing stronger touch stimulus. The combined effect of gravity and touch stimuli on the root tip, along with other surface-derived stimuli and intrinsic cell machinery, cause characteristic root growth behaviors under these conditions (Okada and Shimura 1990; Rutherford and Masson 1996, Simmons et al. 1996). One such behavior is root skewing or slanting, whereby roots tend to deviate their growth progressively away from the gravity vector, always in the same direction (typically rightward, when viewed from the back of the plate, through the agar). Rightward skewing is often accompanied by a left-handed rotation of the root tip about its axis, visible as a left-handed rotation of the epidermal cell files. The degree of skewing varies in wild-type roots of Arabidopsis thaliana, with some accessions showing little or none and others displaying a distinct rightward skew on tilted surfaces (Simmons et al.1995; Rutherford and Masson 1996). Mutants have been discovered that have enhanced right skew or a pronounced leftward skew, the latter of which has never been seen in a wild type A. thaliana accession. Often, these skewing mutants display epidermal cell file rotations (CFR), the degree of which correlates with the level of skewing. The handedness of the CFR also correlates with the direction of skewing: left- handed CFR for rightward skewing and right-handed CFR for leftward skewing (Rutherford and Masson 1996; Furutani et al. 2000; Whittington et al. 2001; Sedbrook et al. 2002; Thitamadee et al. 2002; Yuen et al. 2003; Ishida et al. 2007; Korolev et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2007; Bisgrove et al. 2008; Nakamura and Hashimoto 2009). However, this correlation between CFR, and level of skewing is not observed in all mutants. For instance, the spr2 mutant has a strong helical growth phenotype, yet its epidermal cell file rotation remains wild-type (Furutani et al. 2000). Many skewing mutants also have abnormal cortical microtubule arrays. In wild-type A. thaliana interphase cells in the epidermal and lateral cap layers of the root elongation zone, cortical microtubules are arranged mostly in a transverse orientation. This arrangement correlates with the cells in this region expanding anisotropically, in a direction perpendicular to the transverse arrays (reviewed in Harrison et al. 2008). When the cells approach the shootward portion of the elongation zone (as defined in Baskin et al. 2010), the cortical arrays will briefly shift to oblique right-handed helical arrangements. A left-handed cell file rotation is often visible at this region of the root, corresponding to the right-handed arrays (Okada and Shimura, 1990; Rutherford and Masson, 1996). As the cells continue to the maturation zone, the arrays shift again, this time to form a mostly longitudinal network. Finally, the microtubules become disorganized as the cell stops elongating (Sugimoto et al. 2000). Several skewing mutants have cortical microtubule arrays that fall into helical patterns before reaching the basal side of the elongation zone, the handedness of which correlates to the handedness of the skewing. As with CFR correlations, not all skewing mutants have altered cortical microtubule arrays, including spr2 as well as eb1 and spr1 (Furutani et al. 2000; Sedbrook et al. 2004; Bisgrove et al. 2008). Furthermore, altered arrays in root slanting mutants are not always found in the form of helical patterns. In some cases, arrays are simply disorganized (Bichet et al. 2001; Whittington et al. 2001; Burk and Ye 2002; Webb et al. 2002; Bouquin et al., 2003). Most skewing mutants found to date have changes in tubulin genes or in genes that produce microtubule-associated proteins. These studies have shown that changes in the structure of \xce\xb1-, \xce\xb2-, and \xce\xb3- tubulin subunits can affect microtubule assembly and cause helical root growth behavior, often accompanied by abnormal helical microtubule arrays (Thitamadee et al. 2002; Pastuglia et al. 2006; Ishida et al. 2007; Buschmann et al. 2009). Also, changes in proteins that regulate microtubule polymerization, bundling, and severing can alter the organization and dynamic instability of microtubules and lead to changes in root skewing (reviewed in Sedbrook and Kaloriti 2008; Wasteneys and Ambrose 2009). A few skewing mutants have been discovered that do not directly affect microtubules, but instead are predicted to have an impact on cell wall composition or signaling cascades that contribute to proper anisotropic cell expansion during root growth (Sedbrook et al. 2002; Hu et al. 2003; Yuen et al. 2005).

Another way to gain new insights into root growth patterns is to use the natural variation that exists among members of plant species. Variation among the A. thaliana accessions Columbia, Landsberg erecta, and Wassilewskija for skewing has already been noted (Simmons et al. 1996). Also, we know that defined genetic backgrounds modify waving because in at least one case the same mutant allele (spr1/sku6) results in distinct phenotypes when introgressed into different genetic backgrounds (Sedbrook et al. 2004). In this study, we used a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population created from the A. thaliana accessions Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) (Alonso-Blanco et al. 1998) for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of root growth behaviors on agar surfaces. Our results suggest that a region on chromosome 2 is contributing the most to the difference in skewing between these accessions, although other loci are also implicated. No loci in the candidate region have previously been associated with root skewing. We also performed a microarray analysis using Cvi and Ler root tips from seedlings grown on tilted hard agar to identify genes with differing expression between these accessions in genomic locations that overlap with the QTL, leading to interesting candidate loci between 9.3 and 11.2 Mb on chromosome 2. QTL analysis was carried out with the following stocks from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, Columbus, OH): Cvi-1 (CS8580), Ler-2 (CS8581), and Cvi/Ler recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (CS22000). This population consists of 162 inbred lines that were genotyped at 293 marker loci (Alonso-Blanco et al. 1998). Ten plants per RIL plus multiple Cvi and Ler plants were propagated side by side in a soil composed of Jiffy mix and vermiculite (4:1 volumetric ratio), using a 22\xc2\xb0C growth room with a 16/8-hr light/dark cycle, to bulk seeds for analysis. Light was provided by cool-white fluorescent bulbs at a fluence rate of 35-50 \xc2\xb5mol\xe2\x8b\x85m\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x8b\x85s\xe2\x88\x921. Seed stocks used in fine mapping include near isogenic lines (NILs) HGI2.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 provided by Julin Maloof (University of California\xe2\x80\x93Davis, Davis, CA; derived from the LIGHT2 NIL in Borevitz et al. 2002). The DOG NILs, first used in studies of delay of germination (hence DOG), were provided by Leonie Bentsink (Wageningen University, Wageningen, Netherlands; Alonso-Blanco et al. 2003). The NILs LCN2-4, -6, -7, -8, and -9 and LCN4-6 and -7 (Keurentjes et al. 2007) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (Nottingham, UK; N17079, N17081, N17082, N17083, N17084, N17115, and N17116). The seeds for Figure 1 were obtained from Christopher Schwartz (University of Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x93Madison, Madison, WI; Sy-0) and the ABRC (Bay-0/CS57923, Bs-1/CS6627, Col/CS60000, Est-1/CS1151, Ha-0/CS1218, Kyoto/CS3964, Mr-0/CS1373, No-O/CS1394, Sha/CS57924). For all experiments, the genotypes to be compared were planted in the growth room at the same time and harvested on or near the same day. Natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana root growth behaviors. Representative seedlings from a variety of A. thaliana accessions that were grown on tilted hard agar plates. View is from the back of the plate, through the agar. A 1/2 strength LSPS medium (LSP04-1LT; Caisson Labs, North Logan, UT) was supplemented with 1.5% agar type E (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and poured into square petri dishes to form a hard medium mostly impenetrable to A. thaliana roots. Seeds were surface sterilized with 20% bleach + 0.01% SDS solution then rinsed four times with water. The seeds were sewn on the surface of the medium, and plates were sealed with micropore tape (3M; St. Paul, MN; #1530-0). Seeds were stratified on the plates for 4-6 days at 4\xc2\xb0C, wrapped in two layers of aluminum foil, to overcome the dormancy phenotype of Cvi. Plates were then placed in a vertical orientation in either a Conviron TC16 growth chamber (Conviron, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) for QTL trial 1, or in an Enconair AC60 growth chamber (Enconair, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) for all other trials. The temperature was set at 22\xc2\xb0C in both chambers. Light was provided by cool white fluorescent tubes at a fluence rate of 45-50 \xc2\xb5mol\xe2\x8b\x85m\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x8b\x85s\xe2\x88\x921 in the Conviron chamber (QTL Trial 1), and 80-125 \xc2\xb5mol\xe2\x8b\x85m\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x8b\x85s\xe2\x88\x921 in the Enconair chamber (all other assays), following a 16/8-hr light/dark cycle. Seedlings were grown under these conditions for 3 days. Then, the locations of the root tips of all germinated seedlings were marked with a black felt-tip marker on the back of the plate, and the plates were tilted back at a 30\xc2\xb0 angle. After 2 days of growth at the 30\xc2\xb0 tilt, images were taken of the roots through the medium from the back of the plates with a digital camera. NIH Image (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) version 1.62 was used to determine the following parameters as diagrammed in Figure 2: L, Ly, Lx, Lc, and the angle B. These measurements are used to compute the primary root\xe2\x80\x99s length (L), vertical growth index (VGI), horizontal growth index (HGI), angle of displacement of the root tip (B), and root straightness (Lc/L) (Grabov et al. 2005). Length is measured by tracing the root with the \xe2\x80\x9csegmented line\xe2\x80\x9d tool from the black felt-tip markerline along the root to the root tip. VGI is the ratio of the displacement of the root tip along the y axis, Ly, divided by L. This parameter takes into account the total length of the root and modifies it based on its vertical displacement. A root whose growth depended solely on gravity but was impeded by the agar would be expected to grow straight down along the tilted agar. VGI is part of a description of the deviation of the root from this gravitropic null hypothesis of growth. HGI is the ratio of the displacement of the root tip along the x axis, Lx, divided by L. HGI specifically addresses the amount of skewing (horizontal displacement) undergone by the root. A measurement of the arccosine of angle of overall root tip displacement, B, is taken by dividing Ly by Lc. Straightness is measured by the ratio of the chord that forms a straight line between the black mark at the start of the measurement to the root tip, Lc, divided by L. The more a root is waving and deviating from the path of Lc, the lower the straightness value. However, it should be noted that a root growth path that is meandering away and then returning to Lc will have a lower straightness ratio even if it does not have a regular waving pattern. Together, these measurements give a quantifiable way to measure root morphology on the agar surface (Grabov et al. 2005). Calculations of the means for each of these traits were done using Microsoft Excel. Analysis of variance of the RILs was used to quantify and compare variance between and within RILs. Broad sense heritability (H2) was calculated by dividing the latter by the former [(variance within RILs)/(variance between RILs)]. Measurements taken of seedlings (after Grabov et al. 2005). Measurements were started at the black felt-tip marker line indicating the position of the root tip on the back of the plate after 3 days of vertical growth. After 2 more days of growth at a 30\xc2\xb0 tilt and image capture, a line was traced along each root from the black mark to the tip to get primary root length (L). Then, a line was drawn directly from the black mark to the root tip to get the chord of growth, Lc. Dividing Lc by L gives an indication of the root\xe2\x80\x99s straightness along its growth trajectory. Angle B is calculated as the angle of root tip\xe2\x80\x99s displacement from the vertical, with the vertical being 0\xc2\xb0 and increasing to 90\xc2\xb0 as you move counterclockwise to the right. The trigonometric relationships between Lc and angle B allow the calculation of the Ly and Lx portions of the right triangle. Ly in a ratio with L gives the quantity known as vertical growth index (VGI), and similarly Lx divided by L gives horizontal growth index (HGI), an indication of root skewing. The seed plating for the three QTL trials varied between trial 1 and trials 2/3. For QTL trial 1, each RIL was represented by one plate that contained three rows of five seeds each of the particular RIL, flanked with two Cvi seeds on one side and two Ler seeds on the other. The plates were positioned in the Conviron TC16 chamber and exposed to the wave-assay conditions described above. For QTL trials 2 and 3, nine seeds of the particular RIL or parental control line were placed in one row near the top of the plate. These trials were performed in the Enconair AC60 chamber, also as described above. Plate arrangement was randomized in the growth chamber. For all trials, photographs were taken on day 5, and the roots were measured with NIH Image version 1.62. It should be noted that only the top two rows of seedlings were used for QTL analysis in trial 1 as the growth parameters of Cvi and Ler were found to be significantly different for the top and middle rows vs. the bottom row (P < 0.01), possibly due to lower light intensity on the bottoms of the plate. Means for each trait along with genotypic data (Alonso-Blanco et al. 1998) were entered for QTL analysis into WinQTL Cartographer version 2.5 (http://statgen.ncsu.edu/qtlcart/WQTLCart.htm; Wang et al. 2010) and the R/qtl package (Broman et al. 2003) in R (http://www.r-project.org). For WinQTL Cartographer, maps were created using the Kosambi map function (Kosambi 1944). During composite interval mapping, the model incorporated a 0.5 step rate with a 1.0-cM window size and 10 control markers. LOD thresholds were determined by 1000 permutations (Doerge and Churchill 1996) for each of the traits. In R/qtl, the function \xe2\x80\x9cscanone\xe2\x80\x9d was used for interval mapping, and \xe2\x80\x9cscantwo\xe2\x80\x9d was used to generate the two-dimensional plots. Significance levels for each trait at the additive and epistatic levels were determined by 10,000 permutations implementing the EM algorithm for HGI and straightness, and 1000 permutations for VGI, angle B, and length. The \xe2\x80\x9cscantwo\xe2\x80\x9d output was plotted such that the additive model for a trait is below the diagonal, and the epistatic or interaction model is above it. Seed plating for the phenotyping of NILs, various heterozygotes, and the mapping population was done in the same manner as QTL trials 2 and 3. All statistical tests were performed in Microsoft Excel. Primer design for fine mapping on chromosome 2 (supporting information, Table S4) was based on multiple sources including sequences provided by Julin Maloof (University of California\xe2\x80\x93Davis), polymorphisms listed on TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org), polymorphisms described by Monsanto/CEREON between Columbia and Landsberg erecta (Jander et al. 2002), and polymorphic region predictions on POLYMORPH among the accessions Columbia, Burren, and Tsu (http://polymorph.weigelworld.org/; Clark et al. 2007; Zeller et al. 2008). Three biological repeats with two processing replicates each were plated for the wave assay for the following lines: Cvi, Ler, and HGI2.1. Each replicate consisted of two rows of 60 seeds per row over five plates for a total of \xe2\x88\xbc600 seedlings per replicate. The seeds on the plates were stratified for 8 days, then placed in a 22\xc2\xb0C, 16/8-hr light/dark growth chamber for our standard wave assay. On the fifth day, approximately 7 mm of root tip was harvested for each seedling and pooled for each replicate. The order of sample collection was randomized. The root tips were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at \xe2\x88\x9280\xc2\xb0C until the time of RNA extraction. Frozen tissue was ground using a shaker with 2 ml eppendorf tube holder attachments and one 5-mm stainless steel bead (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per tube, shaken for 30 sec at 20 beats per second. RNA extraction of the ground tissue was carried out with the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA yields were 19\xe2\x80\x9332.5 \xce\xbcg, quantified on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE). One of the above technical replicates, consisting of three biological repeats each of Cvi, Ler, and HGI2.1, was used for microarray hybridization. The hybridization was carried out by the Gene Expression facility at the University of Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x93Madison. RNA integrity was verified with the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Biotin-labeled cDNA was generated using the MessageAmp II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). For each sample, the labeled cDNA was hybridized overnight on an ATH1 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) in an AFX HybOven 480 (Affymetrix). Post processing was done on an automated Fluidics 450 Station (Affymetrix), and the chips were scanned with the GC 3000 G7 scanner (Affymetrix). The scanned images were preprocessed with the AFX Expression Console software. Primary data are publicly available at Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI; accession number GSE28275). Quality of microarray hybridization was determined using the Affymetrix MAS5 algorithm. Expression differences were analyzed using ArrayStar 3 (DNAStar, Madison, WI). The data were preprocessed using RMA and a quantile normalization method. For statistical comparisons of expression levels, the Student\xe2\x80\x99s t-test option was employed with a FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg correction) multiple testing correction algorithm. From the output, expression differences between the samples being compared were requested at 90%, 95%, or 99% confidence levels. When grown on tilted hard agar during the wave assay (see Materials and Methods), different A. thaliana accessions show a variety of root skewing and waving phenotypes (Vaughn et al. 2010; Figure 1). The accessions Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) were chosen for the QTL mapping study because of their distinctive root morphologies on the wave assay, and because a genotyped RIL population was available for them at the time we initiated these experiments. Cvi has a strong skew to the right (viewed from the back of the plate) and no structured pattern of waving, whereas Ler has a weaker right skew and a more regular pattern of waving. Although the skewing and waving differences between Cvi and Ler are qualitatively obvious, we needed to be able to reliably quantify the traits for the QTL study. For skewing, we used both the angle of deviation of the root tip from the vertical and a ratio known as horizontal growth index (HGI) (Grabov et al. 2005; Figure 2; Materials and Methods). The greater the angle or the greater the HGI, the greater the skew of the root to the right. We found these two measurements to be highly correlated (R2 = 0.93), and in this study we will predominantly use HGI as the indicator of root skew. Along with length and HGI, we also calculated vertical growth index (VGI) and the straightness of the root along the chord of growth (Lc/L) (Figure 2; Materials and Methods). Straightness is a rough measure of root waving since the more a root waves, the less direct its path along the axis of growth, Lc, which lowers the Lc/L ratio. The differences between Cvi and Ler for HGI and straightness on the wave assay are highly significant (Figure 3, A, B, E, and F). Cvi roots skew more strongly than Ler as indicated by HGI, and they grow straighter along their paths as indicated by a higher Lc/L value. To get an idea of the dominance of the alleles contributing to skewing and waving in Cvi and Ler, crosses were made to create heterozygotes. For skewing, the F1 seedlings from Ler \xc3\x97 Cvi display a mean root HGI that is intermediate to both parent lines and significantly different from both (Figure 3, C and E). The reciprocal cross of Cvi \xc3\x97 Ler produces seedlings with a mean HGI that is significantly greater than both Ler and the Ler \xc3\x97 Cvi F1\xe2\x80\x99s, but statistically similar to the Cvi parent (Figure 3, D and E). This indicates that maternal effects may contribute to some of the large skew diplayed by Cvi roots on hard surfaces. For straightness, both F1 crosses result in an Lc/L ratio that is intermediate to and significantly different from both parents (Figure 3F). The Cvi \xc3\x97 Ler cross produces a Lc/L ratio that is higher than the Ler \xc3\x97 Cvi F1\xe2\x80\x99s at a P = 0.02 level, so maternal effects may be contributing to this trait as well. HGI and straightness phenotypes for Ler, Cvi, and F1 progeny of crosses between Cvi and Ler. Representative roots for each genotype grown on the wave assay are shown in panels A\xe2\x80\x93D. The means for each genotype for horizontal growth index (HGI) and straightness (Lc/L) are shown in panels E and F. Statistically significant differences between genotypes are represented by distinct letter symbols in the corresponding graph bars (P < 0.05, pairwise t-test). Bars are \xc2\xb1 SE. 41 to 77 seedlings of each type were measured. White bar = 5 mm. Differences between Cvi and Ler for various root growth behavior parameters, particularly those describing skew and straightness, made them good candidates for a QTL study on these traits. The Cvi/Ler recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was subjected to the wave assay for three trials. Of the available 162 RILs, 149, 153, and 156 individuals were used in trials 1, 2, and 3, respectively, due to poor germination of some of the lines. Measurements made on the seedling roots include root length, HGI, VGI, angle B, and straightness. For each of these phenotypes, RIL means showed transgression with respect to parental means, and broad sense heritabilities ranged from 0.29 to 0.62 (Figure 4, A and D; Figure S1; Table S1). Both of these factors indicate the population is well-suited to QTL mapping for these traits. QTL analysis of skewing and straightness in the Cvi/Ler RIL population. (A, D) Histograms of RIL means over the three QTL trials for HGI and Lc/L, respectively. The color-coded arrows indicate the means for the Cvi and Ler parents for each trial; (B, E) Composite interval mapping (CIM) analysis over three trials for HGI (B) and Lc/L (E). The top portion of the graph gives the LOD score across the five chromosomes of A. thaliana. LOD significance thresholds determined by 1000 permutations for each trial are shown as horizontal lines across the graphs. 2-LOD intervals for significant QTL peaks are black bars beneath the peaks. The bottom graph is an indication of the additive value toward the phenotype of each genomic region with respect to the Ler allele. In panels A, B, D, and E, trial 1 is represented in red, trial 2 in black, and trial 3 in blue. (C, F) Two-dimensional QTL scans for HGI (C) and Lc/L (F). Plots are for trial 2. The x- and y-axes represent positions along the five A. thaliana chromosomes. The region of the plot below the diagonal gives the additive QTL model, while the region above the diagonal shows epistatic interaction analysis. Heat map LOD significance thresholds were determined by 10000 permutations. The black arrow on the left LOD scale is the significance threshold for the epistatic portion of the plot, and the arrow on the right side is the threshold for the additive part. The phenotype information we compiled from these measurements was paired with the genotype information already generated by Alonso-Blanco et al. (1998) to create QTL maps. Using composite interval mapping, significant QTL peaks were found for all traits measured (Figure 4, B and E; Figure S1, Table S2). Many of the QTL were consistently significant in all three trials. Two-dimensional (2D) scans were also performed on the traits for all three trials. As a whole, the 2D scans were relatively consistent from trial to trial for the additive portion, and consistent with the composite interval maps. The epistatic interaction portions of the graphs were more variable among the three trials. 2D scans for trial 2 for all the traits are presented here (Figure 4, C and F; Figure S1) as well as the 2D scans for trials 1 and 3 (Figure S2 and Figure S3, respectively). Because the maternal effects may be contributing to the values of some of the traits as seen in the F1 crosses of Cvi and Ler, we also evaluated the means of the traits for each of the three trials with respect to RIL cytoplasm donor. 117 of the RILs of the Cvi/Ler population were created using Cvi as the maternal parent, and 45 RILs have Ler as the maternal parent (Alonso-Blanco et al. 1998). None of the traits are significantly different with respect to cytoplasm for trials 1 and 2. However, in trial 3, straightness, length, and vertical growth index all showed significant differences with respect to cytoplasm donor (Figure S4). It is surprising that HGI showed no significant differences with respect to cytoplasm in the RILs considering Cvi and Ler reciprocal heterozygotes had shown a possible maternal effect for this trait (Figure 3). We decided to focus on fine mapping the QTL for HGI due to our interest in skewing and the insights mutant studies have given us into the involvement of microtubule dynamics and cell wall composition, among others, in modulating this behavior. For HGI, all three trials predicted significant QTL in the same positions on chromosomes 2, 4, and 5 (Figure 4B). In particular, the locus centered at 40 cM on chromosome 2 was a good candidate for fine mapping due to its reproducibility over all three trials, a relatively large predicted phenotypic effect accounting for 16%\xe2\x80\x9320% of the phenotypic difference between Cvi and Ler (Table S2), and the fact that no known tubulin or microtubule-associated proteins resided in the predicted 2-LOD interval. The additive effects map shown at the bottom of the QTL-map graph (Figure 4B) indicates that having a Ler allele in this region lowers HGI value (i.e., lessens skew). A series of NILs was used to analyze the effects of Cvi segments on skewing in the three HGI QTL regions on chromosomes 2, 4, and 5. The NILs have Cvi segments of variable lengths introgressed into the area of interest in an otherwise Ler background. For the QTL at the end of chromosome 4, LCN4-6 is weakly significant for greater skew than Ler (P = 0.05) as would be predicted if its Cvi introgression overlaps with the causative locus. However, LCN4-7 (Keurentjes et al. 2007) did not show a skew different from that of Ler (Figure S5). This result may narrow the candidate interval for this QTL. However, it will be difficult to further map the causative locus because its effect on skewing is barely above significance threshold. For the QTL centered around position 78-80 on chromosome 5, some the DOG17 NILs (Alonso-Blanco et al. 2003) were found to be significantly different from Ler for HGI and several of the other measured traits (Table S3). This would be predicted as all of the traits measured over three trials had significant QTL peaks for this region of chromosome 5 (Figure 4, B and E; Figure S1), and for some epistatic interactions are predicted to affect some of these traits (Figure 4C; Figure S2, B, D, and E; Figure S3, B and E). This region seems to be a very complex contributor to root growth behavior, and further dissection is needed to narrow the regions contributing to the phenotypes and their relative additive and interactive effects. For the chromosome 2 HGI QTL, NILs HGI2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 (derived from LIGHT2 in Borevitz et al. 2002) and LCN lines 2-4, 2-6, 2-7, 2-8, and 2-9 (Keurentjes et al. 2007) were analyzed. All lines have Cvi chromosome 2 segments of various lengths introgressed into an otherwise Ler background (Figure 5C).

N2-7 were significantly greater than Ler over several trials (Figure 5, A and B). These three lines therefore contain a segment of Cvi able to significantly increase skew over Ler values, as predicted by the additive effect chart (Figure 4B). However, the three NILs have HGI values significantly lower than Cvi, indicating other regions of the genome are factors in Cvi\xe2\x80\x99s large skewing value, including some of the QTL identified in this study. In two out of five trials with the LCN lines, LCN2-9\xe2\x80\x99s skew was significantly greater than Ler (P = 0.05 and P = 0.02; data not shown). Skewing phenotypes of chromosome 2 NILs and fine mapping. (A, B) HGI means for two sets of chromosome 2 NILs. At least 30 seedlings per genotype were analyzed. *Significantly different skew from Ler (P < 0.01); **highly significant (P < 0.0001). Bars are \xc2\xb1 SE. (C) Schematic of the fine mapping of the NILs for chromosome 2. White bars are confirmed Ler chromosomal regions, black are Cvi, and gray is where the breakpoint is undetermined. The parallel dashed lines across the chromosomes flank the probable region of a QTL for skewing. We developed insertion-deletion and CAPs primers identifying polymorphisms between Cvi and Ler on Chromosome 2 (Table S4 and Table S5) and used them to define the breakpoints between introgressed Cvi and Ler segments in these NILs. The combination of this genotypic data with the phenotypic observations for HGI of the NILs indicate the causative QTL is located between 9.3 and 11.2 Mb (schematic in Figure 5C). To further break down this interval, HGI2.1 and HGI2.2 were back-crossed into Ler as the first step to creating a mapping population. We took this opportunity to look at HGI in the progeny of this cross, as well as the reciprocal. The phenotype of both F1s is intermediate to and significantly different from both parents, indicating the QTL in this region is semidominant (Figure 6). In this case, the cross direction does not appear to influence the HGI value of the F1. Some of the heterozygotes from the Ler \xc3\x97 HGI2.1 and Ler \xc3\x97 HGI2.2 back-crosses were selfed to generate a mapping population of over 1300 individuals with multiple recombination events in the region of interest. However, fine mapping with the F2 lines has been difficult, leading us to believe the region is more complex than first indicated by the QTL maps. The three NILs that continually show a greater skew than Ler over multiple trials all have very large Cvi introgression segments. When that segment is broken up in the mapping population within the candidate region, some lines are found to have significantly greater skew than Ler, but less so than HGI2.1 or 2.2. This could mean that another part of the Cvi introgression is necessary for the full effect, and the two loci act in an additive manner. When separated, skew is lessened and more subject to environmental variance. The second region may lie in the introgression segment of LCN2-9 since it sometimes has a significantly greater HGI value than Ler. If the second locus is contained in the LCN2-9 introgression, it would likely be toward the distal end where the LCN2-8 and LCN2-9 introgressions no longer overlap, because LCN2-8 never produced an HGI value significantly greater than Ler. Work is underway to map the predicted causative locus in the region between 9.3 and 11.2 Mb. Phenotypes of Ler, HGI2.1, and F1 progeny from crosses between Ler and HGI2.1. (A\xe2\x80\x93D) Representative roots for each genotype grown on the wave assay. (E) Means for each genotype for HGI. Statistically significant differences between genotypes are represented by distinct letter symbols in the corresponding graph bars (P < 0.05, pairwise t-test). Bars are \xc2\xb1 SE. 28 to 93 seedlings of each type were measured. White bar = 5 mm. Because many QTL mapped to date have been due to changes in gene regulatory regions (for review, see Alonso-Blanco et al. 2009), we decided to look at gene expression differences in Cvi and Ler roots subjected to the wave assay. The combination of the microarray data and the QTL data could narrow the pool of candidate genes. We also included HGI2.1 in the analysis. If the locus/loci causing increased skew from chromosome 2 were due to changes in expression, than HGI2.1 should also have those changes compared to Ler. For each of the three genotypes, Cvi, Ler, and HGI2.1, 3 biological replicates of about 600 pooled root tips each were hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays. Linear correlations within replicates ranged from 0.90 to 0.91 for Cvi, 0.93 for Ler, and 0.92 for HGI2.1. At the 95% confidence interval, 699 probe sets showed differential expression between Cvi and Ler (Table S6). Of these sets, nine fell in the interval on chromosome 2 between 9.3 and 11.2 Mb, with a twofold or more change in expression level between the accessions (Table 1). We observed a great deal of variation in the root growth behaviors of A. thaliana accessions on hard agar surfaces. One of the most noticeable behaviors was seen in the accession Cvi, which had the greatest rightward skew of all the lines that were assayed. The TAIR website (www.arabidopsis.org) documents that this accession was first collected growing on a \xe2\x80\x9crocky wall with moss.\xe2\x80\x9d It may be that the skewing pattern its root takes along the hard agar surface reflects an adaptation to this type of soil environment where the root must grow over long spans of rocks for periods of time. Our goal was to use natural genetic variation to find regions of the genome that contribute to root growth behaviors on hard surfaces in Arabidopsis thaliana. The accessions Cvi and Ler differ in both skewing and waving, and so were good candidates for use in a QTL study to try and determine the genetic contributors to these differences. Through QTL mapping with the Cvi/Ler RIL population, we have pinpointed several chromosomal regions predicted to modify root skewing and waving behaviors, as well as root length. A QTL for skewing on chromosome 2 is being pursued by fine mapping and expression analysis of the candidate interval. For the traits we studied, many of the QTL were repeatable over three trials. QTL that did not appear in all studies are more likely to be subject to environmental and experimental variances, or are simply false positives. The differences could also be due to maternal effects that are affected by environmental conditions. Our results indicate there may be a cytoplasmic component to some of the traits we evaluated. Root skewing differed between reciprocal heterozygotes of Cvi and Ler. Using Cvi as the female led to significantly greater skewing than that seen in crosses with Ler as the female parent. In the QTL trials, only trial 3 showed any significant differences for trait means with respect to RIL cytoplasm donor. Because three traits were affected by maternal lineage in this trial, but not in the others, it may be that the experimental conditions of trial 3 were such that they exposed environmentally responsive maternal contributors to root behaviors. We focused our efforts on characterizing the loci contributing to the difference in root skewing, in particular a region centered near 40 cM on chromosome 2. With the help of two sets of NILs, the candidate region has been narrowed to the area between 9.3 and 11.2 Mb. All of the NILs have Ler cytoplasm, so there should be no maternal effects on skewing between them and Ler. This was seen in reciprocal crosses between Ler and HGI2.1. Further fine mapping of the candidate region is underway. From the over 1300-line mapping population, we have identified 143 F3 lines that have a crossover in this interval (between markers LMV 166/167 and LMV 176/177; see Table S4) and should help us further locate genes that contribute to this QTL. Preliminary studies of this region indicate the possibility of multiple loci contributing to the QTL, acting in an additive fashion. We have looked at the wave assay phenotypes of several mapping population lines with Cvi introgressions of various lengths, broken down from the HGI2.1 introgression. Lines with nonoverlapping segments of Cvi in both the proximal and distal portions of the introgression have shown significantly greater HGI than Ler. Also, the lines with a proximal or distal segment allowing for skew greater than Ler usually skew significantly less the HGI2.1, indicating both segments are needed for the greater HGI seen in HGI2.1. The hypothesis that multiple regions on chromosome 2 are contributing to greater skew over Ler is also supported by the data from NIL2-7 and 2-9. As mentioned in results, LCN2-7 consistently showed a greater skew than Ler over five trials, and LCN2-9 had a significantly greater skew than Ler in two of these trials. So, along with the region between 9.3 and 11.2 Mb, a more distal segment on chromosome 2 that is contained in the Cvi introgression of LCN2-9, but not LCN2-8, appears to be contributing additively to root skewing on surfaces. There are several cases described in plants where multiple changes in a gene region contribute to a particular QTL, for example the tb1 promoter region in maize (Clark et al. 2006) and others involving combinations of promoter and coding region changes (for review, see Alonso-Blanco et al. 2009). In this case, the loci seem to be further apart, involving a region encompassing more than just a single gene and its regulatory sequences. We hope to utilize the mapping population to separate and quantify the effects of the each QTL contributor, if possible. A microarray study using root tips from Cvi, Ler, and the NIL HGI2.1 predicted 699 expression differences between Cvi and Ler. It should be noted that the probes on the ATH1 GeneChip (Affymetrix) are based on Columbia sequence, so probe-binding differences could also be due to polymorphisms changing hybridization efficiency. This may be helpful to identify polymorphisms within regions between the accessions. In the candidate region for the chromosome 2 QTL, nine genes are predicted to be differentially expressed. There are 541 annotated genes in the region between 9.3 and 11.2 Mb, and, to our knowledge, none of them have been described previously as contributing to root skewing behavior. However, the region does contain a few genes related to known skew effectors, including a SKU5-similar gene, SKS16, and an extra large G protein XLG1. Both sku5 and the G protein mutants xlg3 and agb1 have skewing phenotypes (Sedbrook et al. 2002, Pandey et al. 2008). The wave assay for several sks16 T-DNA insertion lines did not show any discernable skewing phenotype (data not shown), and xlg1 does not have a skewing phenotype as a single mutant (Pandey et al. 2008). From our microarray study, the most interesting candidates are the adjacent loci At2g23400 and At2g23410. Probe sets associated with these loci displayed higher hybridization signals with root tip RNA derived from Ler than Cvi and HGI2.1. These genes encode cis-prenyltransferase enzymes (Cunillera et al. 2000), which are part of the dolichol and dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis pathway (Grabi\xc3\xb1ska and Palamarczky 2002). At2g23410 has confirmed cis-prenyltransferase activity, and At2g23400 is predicted to have activity by sequence identity (Cunillera et al. 2000). From studies in yeast, the reaction catalyzed by cis-prenyltranferase commits the cell to dolichol biosynthesis (Adair and Cafmeyer 1987). One branch of this pathway produces dolichyl-phosphate-mannose, which is used for the GPI-anchoring of proteins, among other things (reviewed in Burda and Aebi, 1999). GPI serves as a membrane anchor for a variety of cell wall\xe2\x80\x93associated proteins. One such GPI-anchored protein is SKU5. One of the A. thaliana cis-prenyltransferases, LEW1 (At1g11755), is predicted to glycosylate SKU5 (Zhang et al. 2008). When the SKU5 coding region is mutated such that no protein is produced, seedlings exhibit an enhanced skewing over the wild-type (Sedbrook et al. 2002). SKU5 has been proposed to contribute to enzymatic reactions at the cell wall, and this could possibly affect the changes in cell wall composition when root cells are undergoing cell expansion. COBRA, another GPI-anchored protein, affects the patterning of cell wall microfibrils (Roudier et al. 2005). Mutant cob seedlings have defective anisotropic cell expansion and increased root skewing on hard surfaces (Benfey et al. 1993; Schindelman et al. 2001, Roudier et al. 2005). There is growing evidence that cortical microtubule arrays and cell wall microfibrils must act in concert to produce normal anisotropic cell expansion patterns (Paredez et al. 2006; Paredez et al. 2010). If Cvi is producing less of or altered forms of two cis-prenyltransferases, this could be affecting the amount of GPI donors available for proteins that should be anchored to interact with the cell wall. This change in cell wall composition would manifest itself in the root as an increase in root skewing to the right. To begin the analysis of changes that may exist between Cvi and Ler at the cis-prenyltransferase loci, we used POLYMORPH (http://polymorph-clark20.weigelworld.org/; Ossowski et al., personal communication; Clark et al. 2007; Zeller et al. 2008). The output predicts many polymorphisms throughout the At2g23400 gene and at the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of At2g23410. It also predicts polymorphic regions within the At2g23400 gene, including one amino acid substitution, between Ler and Columbia or Cvi (Figure S6). It should be cautioned here that the Affymetrix ATH1 microarray contains probes for only 376 of the 591 annotated genes present on the QTL interval we mapped on chromosome 2. Therefore, it is also possible that other, yet unidentified genes within that interval are differentially expressed between Cvi an Ler root tips, including additional potentially interesting candidates for this QTL. Further mapping and transgenic-rescue experiments will be needed to address this possibility. This study has shown that natural variation can be harnessed to give us new information on A. thaliana root skewing and waving behaviors. A region on chromosome 2 between 9.3 and 11.2 Mb, which has no characterized skewing mutants, contributes to greater rightward skewing on tilted hard agar plates in Cvi compared to Ler. Further experiments are underway to characterize the causative locus or loci, and preliminary analyses indicate two genes involved in dolichol/dolichyl biosynthesis may be contributing to the skewing difference, possibly by changing cell wall composition. The use of natural genetic variation to gain a greater understanding of how roots respond to gravity, touch, and other tropic stimuli may benefit us in the breeding of plants more suited to particular soil environments. As we try to produce high-yielding crops in diverse conditions, our knowledge of root growth behaviors and their modulation by external cues can help us in the endeavor.

Utilizing genetic data from existing translocation studies in soybean, we identified the chromosomes and approximate breakpoints involved in five translocation lines.Domesticated soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) is a major crop species and the target of substantial investment of resources toward development of genetic and molecular maps, including the recently completed soybean genome sequencing project (Schmutz et al. 2010). However, the study of both classical and molecular cytogenetics of soybean has been relatively difficult and thus slower to develop. Very few large-scale structural aberrations have been characterized in soybean chromosomes (reviewed by Chung and Singh 2008): a few chromosomal inversion lines have been identified (reviewed by Palmer et al. 2000), and only seven accessions are known to involve the exchange of fragments between nonhomologous chromosomes (Palmer and Kilen 1987; Sellner, 1990; Mahama et al. 1999). The difficulty in characterizing even large-scale chromosomal aberrations in soybean can be attributed to their relatively large number (2n = 40; Veatch 1934), small size (\xe2\x88\xbc2 \xc2\xb5m), and morphological homogeneity (Ahmad et al. 1984; Singh and Hymowitz 1988). The inability to directly distinguish between different soybean chromosomes has meant that aberrations had to be characterized primarily by genetics, in combination with cytogenetics, to detect alterations in patterns of meiotic chromosome pairing. The best characterized reciprocal translocation line in soybean is Glycine soja P.I. 101404B, originally identified by Williams (Williams 1948) and genetically characterized by Palmer and Heer (1984). One breakpoint was positioned with respect to genetic markers on one of the two chromosomes involved (Sadanaga and Grindeland 1984; Mahama and Palmer 2003), chromosome 13 (Cregan et al. 1999; Cregan et al. 2001). This translocation appears to predominate in Chinese G. soja accessions (Palmer et al. 1987) and is indistinguishable from the exchange characterized in G. soja P.I. 464890B (Findley et al. 2010, discussed below). The ability to rapidly and definitively address chromosome structure in soybean is now possible due to the development of a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based karyotyping system (Findley et al. 2010), which utilizes genetically anchored bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs; Schmutz et al. 2010) and variation in genomic repeats to identify each soybean chromosome. Using these tools, the translocation in G. soja P.I. 464890B was determined to involve the reciprocal exchange of a (>17.9 Mb) segment of chromosome 13 with a \xe2\x88\xbc4.2 Mb segment of chromosome 11 (Findley et al. 2010). That study was the first detailed structural analysis of any soybean chromosome rearrangement in which both the chromosomes involved and breakpoints were defined. Fortunately, the inability to directly identify translocation chromosomes has not precluded determining whether a given soybean accession contains them, because the presence of rearranged chromosomes can be detected through their interaction with their nonrearranged (normal) counterparts in meiosis. In soybean, such interaction has been detected directly, through chromosome pairing patterns in meiosis in heterozygous chromosome translocation plants (e.g., Singh and Hymowitz 1988; Mahama et al. 1999), or indirectly, through analysis of pollen or ovule abortion in heterozygous chromosome translocation plants (e.g., Palmer et al. 1987). Such heterozygous soybean plants have about 50% pollen and ovule sterility (Palmer and Heer 1984). This is typical of a large number of plants that have equally frequent alternate and adjacent chromosome segregation (Burnham 1962; Endrizzi 1974). Soybean (2n = 40) normally forms 20 bivalents in metaphase I of meiosis (Veatch 1934; Singh and Hymowitz 1988). In F1 plants heterozygous for a reciprocal translocation, in addition to 18 bivalents, interaction between the normal and rearranged chromosomes can generate a single chain, or ring of four (the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x98\x894\xe2\x80\x9d conformation) chromosomes (Mahama et al. 1999). These aberrant, homology-based associations are thus diagnostic in confirming suspected translocations. The power of meiotic cytogenetic analysis also can be harnessed to determine whether a particular chromosome is rearranged in two different reciprocal translocation lines (i.e. whether one or both exchange chromosomes are shared between two different lines, each containing a pair of reciprocally-exchanged chromosomes). For example, if line A has a translocation between chromosomes 1 and 2, and line B has a translocation between chromosomes 2 and 3, in meiosis of transheterozygous F1 plants, chains or rings of six chromosomes (\xe2\x98\x896 conformation) will form (Burnham 1962). The presence of a \xe2\x98\x896 conformation in meiosis in F1 progeny generated from two different reciprocal translocation lines was a key diagnostic criterion in the analysis several soybean translocation lines (Mahama et al. 1999). Through meiotic chromosome interaction studies, combined with pollen/ovule sterility analyses in translocation combinations, Mahama et al. (1999) determined which of the seven extant soybean translocation lines had particular translocation chromosomes in common. Percentage pollen abortion, ovule abortion, and reduction in seed set were higher in F1 plants from crosses among homozygous translocated lines (a greater number of interchanged chromosomes) than from crosses between homozygous translocation lines (only two nonhomologous interchanged chromosomes) (Mahama et al. 1999). A similar inverse relationship in Pisum was reported by Gottschalk (1978). Despite the power of this approach, the translocation chromosomes could not be determined in these lines because the identities of the aberrant chromosomes themselves were unknown. FISH-based soybean karyotyping (Findley et al. 2010) has enabled us to capitalize on genetic interaction data to characterize the remaining uncharacterized translocation lines described in (Mahama et al. 1999). In the present study, we focused on the following six soybean translocation lines: Clark T/T, renamed here as translocation line-1 (TL-1), which has the translocation chromosomes from Glycine soja P.I. 101404B introgressed into G. max cv. Clark; P.I. 189866 (TL-2), a naturally occurring translocation in an accession of Glycine gracilis Skvortz. (Skvortzow 1927), which is a weedy form of soybean from Northeast China (Broich and Palmer 1980; Shoemaker et al. 1986; Chen and Nelson 2004); KS175-7-3 (TL-3), KS172-11-3 (TL-4) and KS171-31-2 (TL-5), were each identified from fast-neutron irradiated G. max populations; and finally, L75-2083-4 (TL-6), a spontaneous translocation identified in progeny of a cross between G. max cultivars (Sadanaga and Newhouse 1982; Palmer and Kilen 1987; Sellner 1990; Mahama et al. 1999). Our analysis of these translocation lines involved sequential unraveling of the relationships detected in the cytological analysis of meiotic chromosome structures formed in plants transheterozygous for these various chromosomes.'","b'Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) is a major crop species and, therefore, a major target of genomic and genetic research.

Our analysis of these translocation lines involved sequential unraveling of the relationships detected in the cytological analysis of meiotic chromosome structures formed in plants transheterozygous for these various chromosomes. Sample preparation, FISH experiments, and image processing were performed precisely as described in Findley et al. (2010). The Cent-Gm repeat-based FISH cocktail is based on differential chromosome painting with a cocktail of fluorophore-tagged oligonucleotides whose sequences target four variants of Cent-Gm, the soybean centromeric repeat (Vahedian et al. 1995; Swaminathan et al. 2007; Gill et al., 2009; Findley et al. 2010). The cocktail used in Figures 3\xe2\x80\x935 utilized the following fluorophore-conjugated oligonucleotide probes (amount per slide): CY5-CentGm-2-M (7.5 ng), fluorescein-CentGm-2-E (20 ng), Texas red-615-CentGm-1-AF (0.01 ng), fluorescein-CentGm-1-G (20 ng), and CY5-SB86-C (20 ng). A fluorescein-SB86-C oligonucleotide (10 ng) was used for FISH in Figure 2, panels D and H. Images in Figure 4, panels K-L, utilized two fluorophore-conjugated Cent-Gm oligonucleotide probes (amount per slide): fluorescein-CentGm-2-E (10 ng) plus fluorescein-CentGm-1-G (10 ng) (see Findley et al. 2010 for oligonucleotide sequences). For all FISH and 4\xe2\x80\x99,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) images, chromosomes presented in pairs (e.g. Figure 3, panels H3 and H4) were obtained from a single image of a single chromosome spread that contained both chromosome types. Exceptions were the following images that only required single chromosome types, which were obtained individually: Figures 2D; 2H; 3C; 4, C and F; 4, D and G; 4, K1\xe2\x80\x93K10; 4, L1\xe2\x80\x93L10; 5E3; 5F3; 5, G3\xe2\x80\x93G6; 5K3; 5L4; and 5, M5\xe2\x80\x93M6. Seeds germinated for isolation of root-tip chromosomes from lines characterized in the present study were derived from plants homozygous for their respective translocations. Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv W82 (G. max W82) was used as control. As described in (Schmutz et al. 2010), homeologous sequences exist for the majority of regions from which BAC probes are derived; therefore, secondary hybridization signals are also frequently detectable in FISH images (Findley et al. 2010). However, these secondary hybridization signals are as a rule less bright, and thus distinguishable from primary signals. The hybridization signals for BAC probes in the \xe2\x80\x9ctester\xe2\x80\x9d set developed for individual chromosome identification (Findley et al. 2010) are well characterized. Additional BAC probes for breakpoint mapping studies were used in combination with well-characterized BACs, thereby ensuring proper chromosome identification. The CS mutant was found in a cross of cv. SRF350 Pike in 1976 by Carol Schoener, a graduate student with Dr. W.R. Fehr at Iowa State University at Ames, Iowa. P.I. 189866 is a plant introduction from northeastern China identified as G. gracilis Skvortzov. It is homozygous for a chromosome translocation (X. Delannay and R.G. Palmer, unpublished results). Fertile plants in entry A04-19 (CS mutant line) segregating fertile and sterile plants were used as female parent in manual cross-pollinations with A04-152 (PI189866). The F1 seed was advanced to the F2 generation at the University of Puerto Rico/Iowa State University soybean nursery near Isabela, Puerto Rico, as entry 4. All F1 plants were heterozygous for the chromosome translocation and exhibited about 50% pollen sterility and reduced seed set. The F1 plants were single-plant threshed. The F2 seed were planted at the Bruner Farm near Ames, Iowa in summer 2005. Two F2 families (A05-187 and A05-188) segregated for the chromosome translocation and for the CS sterile that were used for the mapping study. Mature flower buds were collected from each plant separately and placed into vials containing 70% (v/v) ethanol. The anthers were squashed and pollen dispersed in a drop of 1% (v/v) I2KI solution (Jensen 1962). Plants were classified as fertile, about 50% pollen sterile, or male sterile by observations of pollen grain stain intensity at 100\xc3\x97 magnification. At maturity, F2 plants were single-plant threshed. The F2:3 progenies were grown at the Bruner Farm in 2006. Approximately 50 to 60 seeds per progeny row were tractor planted in 3-m-long rows, spaced 0.7 m apart. Progeny rows were classified for segregation of the CS sterile mutant and the semisterility of the heterozygous chromosome translocation. The genotype of each individual F2 plant was rationalized based upon the segregation pattern of its F2:3 progeny row. Ten grams of young trifoliates were collected from each F2 plant and stored in individual plastic bags and freeze-dried for 48 to 72 hr. Dry leaves were transferred to 15 mL sterile propylene tubes, ground to powder using glass beads, and kept at \xe2\x88\x9280\xc2\xb0C until DNA extraction. The protocol for DNA extractions of Kato and Palmer (2004) was followed. PCR reactions were performed under one of two conditions. In one set of reactions, 30 \xc2\xb5l reactions contained 1X Reaction Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 25\xc2\xb0C), 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100; Promega), 0.15 mM each dNTP, 1.75 mM MgCl2, 1.7 ng/\xc2\xb5l genomic DNA, 0.15 \xc2\xb5M forward primer, 0.15 \xc2\xb5M reverse primer, and 0.1 U Taq polymerase (Promega). DNA was amplified for 32 cycles with denaturation at 94\xc2\xb0C for 45 sec, annealing at 47\xc2\xb0C for 45 sec, and extension at 68\xc2\xb0C for 45 sec. In the other set of reactions, 20 \xc2\xb5l reactions contained 1X Thermopol Reaction Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.8 at 25\xc2\xb0C; New England Biolabs), 0.20 mM each dNTP, 2.5 ng/\xc2\xb5l genomic DNA, 0.5 \xc2\xb5M forward primer, 0.5 \xc2\xb5M reverse primer, and 0.025 U/\xc2\xb5l Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs). DNA initially was denatured at 95\xc2\xb0C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95\xc2\xb0C for 30 sec, annealing at 45\xc2\xb0C for 30 sec, and extension at 68\xc2\xb0C for 30 sec, and a final extension step at 68\xc2\xb0C for 7 min. A PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research) was used for all reactions. PCR amplicons were analyzed on 3%\xe2\x80\x935% High Resolution Blend agarose (Amresco) containing 0.20 \xc2\xb5g/\xc2\xb5l ethidium bromide in 1X TBE buffer (0.089 M Tris base, 0.089 M boric acid, and 2 mM ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid). Gels were run at a constant 80-100 V for 1.5-4 hr and visualized using UV-transillumination. Amplicons from F2 plants were noted as having either a parental or nonparental genotype. Linkage groups (including pseudo-linkage groups) were determined using QuadMap (Durrant et al. 2006) and MapMaker 3.0 (Lander et al. 1987). MapMaker 3.0 was further used to determine marker order and distances. Graphical representations of the maps were generated by MapChart 2.1 (Voorrips 2002). TL-2 was reported as a homozygous chromosome translocation line by Delannay et al. (1982). A cross of cv. Minsoy (PI27890) x CS mutant was used to molecularly map the CS mutant with SSRs to Classical Genetic Linkage Group 3 (i.e., CGLG3; Pappas and Palmer, unpublished results). CGLG3 corresponds to Molecular Linkage group D1a (Cregan et al. 1999) and the pseudomolecule for G. max chromosome 1 (Gm01) (Schmutz et al. 2010). The CS locus was previously found to be linked to the translocation breakpoint in the TL-2 line (Mahama and Palmer 2003). While this information identified the involvement of chromosome 1 in the translocation, the identity of the other chromosome had to be determined by other means. To identify SSR markers that could be used for molecular mapping, the TL-2 line and CS mutant were screened for polymorphisms at several SSR loci on each chromosome (data not shown). These results allowed for the identification of Glycine gracilis (Gg) linkage groups between markers on Gg01 and Gg08. PCR amplification of polymorphic SSR markers from Gg01 and Gg08 (supporting information, Table S1) was performed on genomic DNA from 174 F2 progeny. Several SSR markers from Gg01 and Gg08 were found to be linked. Initial analysis involved evaluating linkage groups using the program QuadMap (Durrant et al. 2006), which identifies linkage groups in lines with heterozygous translocations. QuadMap was expected to identify four linkage groups, each corresponding to chromosome segments on either side of the translocation breakpoints in the TL-2 line; however, QuadMap was unable to tease apart the pseudolinkage groups, including linkage of several SSR markers from the short arms of Gg01 and Gg08. The inability of QuadMap to identify the translocated segments of TL-2 prevented localization of the translocation breakpoint using molecular mapping alone, as several different maps with similar LOD scores could be generated in MapMaker. To correctly identify the region of the translocation breakpoints in Gg01 and Gg08 (Figure 1), it was necessary to use information about centromere association supplied from the FISH experiments (described below). We generated maps that show linkage of the long arm markers from chromosomes one and eight with a distance of \xe2\x88\xbc19 cM between the two closest SSRs (Figure 1, right). Perhaps most striking was the close linkage between Satt_482 and Satt_333 from the short arms of chromosome one and eight, respectively (Figure 1, left). A 1.5-cM distance between these two SSRs reflects their pericentromeric locations on the same segment. Genetic linkage maps of Gg01 and Gg08 from G. gracilis. SSR markers from Gg01 are in gray; SSR markers from Gg08 are in black. Several markers from the short arms of Gg01 and Gg08 are closely linked. Using information about centromere association from the FISH analysis, all short arm markers from Gg01 and Gg08 were mapped to the same chromosome (left map) as were all long arms markers (right map). Map distances are shown in centiMorgans (cM). Based on both cytology (Figure 2D1; Findley et al. 2010) and genome sequence assembly (Schmutz et al. 2010), Gm01 is a nearly acrocentric chromosome, whose short arm (Gm01-SA) and long arm (Gm01-LA) correspond to the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends, respectively, of the corresponding pseudomolecule (see Figure 2A). In metaphase chromosome spreads of TL-2 (data not shown), a single chromosome pair appeared aberrantly large (Figure 2H1). To determine whether this chromosome was related to chromosome 1 (Gg01) in TL-2 (Glycine gracilis) and to investigate its structure, we used two Gm01-specific FISH probes. This first was a Gm01 pseudomolecule-derived BAC (Gm08-BAC-E; Table S2) that hybridizes to the distal end of Gm01-LA in G. max W82 (Figure 2D1). The second was an oligonucleotide-based probe targeting an 86-basepair genomic repeat (SB86) that uniquely hybridizes to a centromere-proximal position on Gm01-LA (Figure 2D1; Findley et al. 2010). In TL-2, both probes hybridized to the same arm of the aberrant chromosome, suggesting that much of the Gm01-LA-homologous segment was intact in this accession (Figure 2H1). However, the opposite chromosome arm was much longer in TL-2 in comparison to the Gm01-SA (Figure 2, D1 and H1). FISH-based characterization of translocation line TL-2. (A) Diagram of Gm01 and Gm08 in G. max W82. Numbers indicate positions (in bp or Mb) in the pseudomolecule of each chromosome. For Gm01, the short arm (\xe2\x80\x9cSA\xe2\x80\x9d) is comprised of the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end (bp \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9d) through the centromere region (at \xe2\x88\xbc16.6 Mb); the long arm (\xe2\x80\x9cLA\xe2\x80\x9d) extends from the centromere to the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end (at 55.9 Mb in the pseudomolecule). For Gm08, the long arm (\xe2\x80\x9cLA\xe2\x80\x9d) is comprised of the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end (bp \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9d) through the centromere region (at \xe2\x88\xbc28.8 Mb); the short arm (\xe2\x80\x9cSA\xe2\x80\x9d) extends from the centromere to the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end (at 47.0 Mb). The yellow shading depicts the approximate extent of high-repeat content sequence that defines pericentromeric chromatin. The paired red dots indicate positions of BAC probes used in mapping experiments (representative FISH images are shown; see Table S2 for complete series). The blue triangles indicate the approximate breakpoint positions for TL-2; the gray outlines represent chromosome structure unaffected by the translocation. The blue shading indicates the chromosome sections that the BACs were mapped relative to in (D\xe2\x80\x93K). (B) Model of the TL-2 translocation chromosomes. Gg08 (Glycine gracilis chromosome 8) is comprised of sequences homologous to Gm08-LA, the Gm08 centromere, and the Gm01-LA; Gg01 is comprised of sequences homologous to Gm01-SA, the Gm01 centromere and the Gm01-SA. (C) Data summary of the probe sets used in FISH for G. max W82 (D\xe2\x80\x93G) and TL-2 (H\xe2\x80\x93K).

The arrowhead indicates the aberrantly large chromosome arm associated with the Gm01-LA-homologous probes in the mutant. The DAPI signal in (D1) and (H1) is inverted to black to accentuate chromosome structure. In the G. max W82 BAC mapping control experiments (E\xe2\x80\x93G), the upper panels are diagrams of the FISH data (middle panels), and corresponding DAPI-stained chromosomes (lower panels). In the TL-2 BAC mapping experiments (I\xe2\x80\x93K), the lower panels are diagrams of the FISH data (uppermost panels), and corresponding DAPI-stained chromosomes (middle panels). In (E\xe2\x80\x93G) and (I\xe2\x80\x93K), three FISH probe hybridization signals are detected: the BAC probe tested (e.g., Gm01-BAC-A= \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d in diagrams, with red hybridization signal, indicated by arrowhead), a Gm01-LA marker (\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d in diagrams, indicating the SB86 repeat probe, with blue hybridization signal) and a Gm08-SA marker (\xe2\x80\x9c7\xe2\x80\x9d in diagrams, indicating Gm08-BAC-7, with green hybridization signal). (E and I) The Gm01-SA probes (Gm01-BAC-A, -B, and -C) hybridized to Gm01-SA in G. max W82 (E1, E3, and E5, respectively), but to the arm opposite the Gm08-SA-homologous arm in TL-2 (I2, I4, and I6, respectively). (F and J) The Gm08-LA probes (Gm08-BAC-1, -2, and -3) hybridized to Gm08-LA in G. max W82 (F2, F4, and F6, respectively), but to the arm opposite the Gm01-LA-homologous arm in TL-2 (J1, J3, and J5, respectively). (G and K) The Gm08-SA probes (Gm08-BAC-4, -5, and -6) hybridized to Gm08-SA in G. max W82 (G2, G4, and G6, respectively), and also to the Gm08-SA-homologous arm in TL-2 (K2, K4, and K6, respectively). The high hybridization background of the red probes used in the experiments in (E5), (I5), (G1), and (K1) obscures the blue SB86 hybridization signal, which more evident when the blue channel is examined individually. The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (H1) is valid for FISH and chromosome panels (D1). The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (K6) is valid for (E\xe2\x80\x93G) and (I\xe2\x80\x93K). Having confirmed the involvement of chromosome 1 in the TL-2 translocation, we sought to characterize the segment juxtaposed to the Gm01-LA-homologous segment in this accession by utilizing the collection of chromosome-assigned BAC probes developed for FISH-based karyotyping of G. max and G. soja (Findley et al. 2010). To test for a novel association of other chromosome sequences with the Gm01-LA-homologous segment in TL-2, we screened one or two BAC probes derived from each Gm chromosome by FISH. Of the 24 (of 40 possible) chromosome termini probed by these BACs, only the BAC derived from the distal end of the Gm08-LA (BAC GM_WBb0096N20; Table S2, line 31) hybridized to the chromosome containing the SB86 repeat probe target (data not shown; see Figure 2, J1, J3, and J5 for equivalent localization patterns). Thus, in TL-2, a segment homologous to Gm08-LA is associated with a chromosome segment homologous to Gm01-LA. To determine whether the translocation is reciprocal, we used positioned BAC clones (Figure 2, A and C and Table S2) to assess associations between chromosome segments homologous to Gm01-SA, Gm01-LA, Gm08-LA, and Gm08-SA in TL-2. Having determined that much of the Gm01-LA-homologous region was intact in TL-2, we tested whether sequences corresponding to Gm01-SA are associated with the segment homologous to Gm01-LA. While all G. max chromosomes are characterized by large pericentromeric regions defined by a high content of repetitive DNA elements (Lin et al. 2005; Schmutz et al. 2010), Gm01 has an unusually extended high-repeat region (Figure 2A), which significantly constrained BAC probe selection. We tested eight Gm01-SA BACs (including Gm01-BAC-A through -C, Table S2; Figure 2C) in combination with two other probes: SB86 and a Gm08-SA terminal BAC (Gm08-BAC-7). In G. max W82, each of the Gm01-SA-derived BACs hybridized to Gm01-SA (Figure 2, E1, E3, and E5). In contrast, in TL-2, each of these probes hybridized to the arm opposite to the one hybridizing to Gm08-BAC-7 (Figure 2, I2, I4, and I6), thus indicating a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 1 and 8 in TL-2 in which the Gg01-SA is associated with the Gg08-SA, and the Gg01-LA is associated with the Gg08-LA. To determine the extent of Gm08-LA sequences associated with the Gm01-LA-homologous segment, we tested 15 Gm08-LA-derived BACs, (Figure 2, A and C and Table S2). In W82, these BACs hybridized to Gm08-LA at expected positions (Figure 2, F2, F4, and F6, diagrammed in Figure 2C and data not shown). In contrast, in TL-2, each of these probes hybridized to the chromosome arm opposite to the one hybridizing to the SB86 probe (Figure 2, J1, J3, and J5, diagrammed in Figure 2C and data not shown). Thus, in TL-2, the majority of the segment homologous to Gm08-LA is associated with the chromosome segment homologous to Gm01-LA, thereby explaining the greater overall length of the aberrant chromosome in this line. Finally, we determined the extent of Gm08-SA homologous sequences that were associated with the Gm01-SA-related fragment in TL-2. We tested eight BACs (including Gm08-BAC-4 through -7, Figure 2C, and Table S2) spanning Gm08-SA. In G. max W82, each of these BACs hybridized to as expected (Figure 2, G2, G4, and G6 and data not shown). Similarly, each Gm08-SA probe hybridized to the chromosome arm targeted by the Gm08-SA-terminal probe (Gm08-BAC-7) in TL-2 (Figure 2, K2, K4, and K6 and data not shown). Therefore, most Gm08-SA-homologous sequences are associated with the tested Gm01-SA-homologous sequences in TL-2. These experiments indicate a reciprocal translocation in TL-2 between chromosome 1 and chromosome 8 in which a segment homologous to Gm01-SA is associated with a segment homologous to Gm08-SA; whereas a segment homologous to Gm08-LA is associated with a segment homologous to Gm01-LA, resulting in the two chromosome forms shown in Figure 1 and 2B. More precise definition of the translocation breakpoints in chromosomes 1 and 8 was not possible using BAC clones, due to the high repeat content of the pericentromeric regions. However, we could identify translocation chromosomes based on their centromere labeling, because chromosomes in numerous G. soja and G. max lines share similar coloration/intensity of Cent-Gm cocktail hybridization (Findley et al. 2010 and unpublished observations). Using this approach (data not shown), we found that the Gm01-SA-BAC signals to be associated with a chromosome whose centromere color (aqua) resembled Gm01, suggesting that one breakpoint of the translocation (relative to G. max) occurred on the Gm01-LA (Figure 2A), resulting in the chromosome that we designate Gg01 (Glycine gracilis chromosome 1). However, the centromere color of the second translocation chromosome was not similar to either Gm08 or Gm01, suggesting that the centromere repeats of Gg08 are divergent. Molecular mapping of SSR markers supports breakpoints near the centromeres of both Gg01 and Gg08, with the close linkage of Satt482 (from chromosome 1) and Satt333 (from chromosome 8) being particularly striking (\xe2\x88\xbc1 cM apart; Figure 1). TL-4 formed the \xe2\x98\x896 conformation in translocation heterozygotes with TL-1; because TL-1 involves a translocation between Gm11 and Gm13 (Findley et al. 2010), it seemed likely that TL-4 would involve a translocation in one of these two chromosomes. Our strategy for characterizing this and other translocations involved three steps: first, assessment of overall chromosome morphology by examining the mutant karyotype; second, identification of candidate translocation chromosomes using the Cent-Gm cocktail in combination with chromosome-specific BAC probes; and finally, translocation chromosome verification and breakpoint estimation using positioned BAC probes (Schmutz et al. 2010). TL-4 chromosome spreads (Figure 3B) revealed two aberrant chromosome pairs: one that was much longer than typical soybean chromosomes (Figure 3B, arrowheads; enlarged chromosome in panel E), and a second, much shorter satellite chromosome (Figure 3B, arrows; enlarged chromosome in panel D). Cent-Gm cocktail hybridization (Figure 3A, arrowheads; enlarged chromosome in panel F) indicated that the shorter chromosome was likely a truncated form of Gm13; whereas the blue-green color of the larger chromosome centromere (Figure 3A, arrows; enlarged in panel G) suggested that it might be a modified form of Gm02, Gm04, Gm10, or Gm17. FISH with paired, chromosome-specific, terminal-position BAC probes for Gm02, Gm10, and Gm17 labeled opposite termini of single chromosome pairs with more typical morphology, indicating that these chromosomes were intact in TL-4 (data not shown). In contrast, the Gm04 terminal BAC probes (Table S2 and Figure 3H4), both labeled the aberrantly large TL-4 chromosome (Figure 3H6). The signal for the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 Gm04 BAC (labeled \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9d in Figure 3, H1, H2, and K1) labeled near a chromosome terminus in TL-4 (Figure 3H6, red signal, indicated by arrow), as it did in G. max W82 (Figure 3H4, red signal, indicated by arrow), indicating that the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of TL-4 Gm04 was intact. In contrast, the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 Gm04 BAC (labeled \xe2\x80\x9c2\xe2\x80\x9d in Figure 3, H1, H2, and K1) hybridized internally within the aberrantly long arm, suggesting a distal addition to an otherwise intact Gm04 in this mutant.

(Row K) Translocation model for TL-4. (K1) A segment of Gm13 containing at least those sequences corresponding to Gm13-BAC-A through Gm13-BAC-C translocated (blue shading with arrow) to the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of Gm04, resulting in the TL-4 chromosome forms shown in (K2). (K3) Additional TL-4 FISH image with the most centromere-proximal Gm13 probe, Gm13-BAC-A (labeled \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2), which hybridized internally within longer arm of the large chromosome (red hybridization signal in K6, indicated by arrow), close to the position of Gm04-BAC-2 (labeled \xe2\x80\x9c2\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2) on the long arm of the same chromosome (green hybridization signal in K6, indicated by arrowhead). In columns H1\xe2\x80\x93K1, the diagram for Gm04 is inverted so that the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the chromosome (labeled \xe2\x80\x9cLO\xe2\x80\x9d) is on the bottom, whereas the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end (labeled \xe2\x80\x9cHI\xe2\x80\x9d) is on the top. Unless otherwise indicated in this way in subsequent figures, the top of a chromosome corresponds to the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the corresponding pseudomolecule. The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (B) is also valid for (A). The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (G) is valid for (C\xe2\x80\x93G). The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (J6) is valid for (H\xe2\x80\x93K).

Panels (I) and (K) are diagrammatic summaries of the FISH experiments performed in (K-L) using a series of Gm13-LA BAC probes (Gm13-BAC-1 through -11; see Table S2). (K1\xe2\x80\x93K10) The upper, middle, and lower panels are the chromosome diagram, FISH signal, and DAPI signal, respectively, for G. max W82 Gm13. The chromosome in each FISH panel has signal derived from three probes: a single tested Gm13-LA BAC (red hybridization signal, indicated in the K1 FISH panel by the arrow), plus Gm13-BAC-11 (green, chromosome-terminal hybridization signal, indicated in the K1 FISH panel by the arrowhead) and the Cent-Gm cocktail (the green, centromeric hybridization signal, indicated in the K1 FISH panel by the dot). In (K1\xe2\x80\x93K10), the Gm13 BAC probes hybridized to positions spanning from Gm13-LA-proximal (K1) to Gm13-LA-terminal (K10). (L1\xe2\x80\x93L10) The upper, middle, and lower panels are the FISH signal, DAPI signal, and the chromosome diagram, respectively, for TL-3 Gm13. The chromosome in each FISH panel has signal derived from three probes, as described for (K1\xe2\x80\x93K10). In (L1\xe2\x80\x93L10), Gm13-BAC-11 hybridized to a terminal position on the shorter arm of the aberrant Gm13 form in TL-3. (L1\xe2\x80\x93L3) Only the three most centromere-proximal Gm13-BAC probes (Gm-BAC-1 through -3) hybridized near the centromere of the longer arm of the mutant Gm13. (L4\xe2\x80\x93L10) Each of the remaining Gm13 BAC probes (Gm13-BAC-4 through -10) hybridized sequentially more distally, on the shorter arm of TL-3 Gm13. (M and N) FISH utilizing pseudomolecule-derived BAC probes to map the TL-3 translocation. The G. max W82 chromosome diagrams in each column 1 panel correspond to the G. max W82 FISH images in columns 3 and 4; the TL-3 chromosome diagrams in each column 2 panel correspond to the TL-3 FISH images in columns 5 and 6. In columns 3-6, FISH hybridization panels are shown above their corresponding DAPI-stained chromosomes. (Row M) In G. max W82 (M1), Gm05-BAC-A (labeled \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d in column 1) hybridized to one end of Gm05 (red hybridization signal in M4, indicated by arrow); Gm05-BAC-B (labeled \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d in column 1) hybridized to the opposite end of Gm05 (green hybridization signal in M4, indicated by arrowhead). In TL-3, Gm05-BAC-A (labeled \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2) hybridized to a centromere-distal position on the arm of the aberrantly small chromosome (green hybridization signal in H6, indicated by arrowhead); Gm05-BAC-B (labeled \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2) hybridized to the distal end of the longer arm of the aberrant Gm13 (red hybridization signal in (H5), indicated by arrow). (Row N) In G. max W82, Gm13-BAC-11 (labeled \xe2\x80\x9c11\xe2\x80\x9d in column 1) hybridized to the distal end of the Gm13-LA (red hybridization signal in (N3), indicated by arrow); Gm05-BAC-B (labeled \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d in column 1) hybridized to the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of Gm05 (green hybridization signal in (N4), indicated by arrowhead). In TL-3 (N2), Gm13-BAC-11 (labeled \xe2\x80\x9c11\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2) hybridized to a distal position on the shorter arm of the aberrant Gm13 (red hybridization signal in (N5), indicated by arrow); Gm04-BAC-B (labeled \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2) hybridized near the terminus of the longer arm of the same chromosome (green hybridization signal in (N5), indicated by arrowhead). (Row O) Model of the events that generated the chromosome forms in TL-3. (O1) Diagram of the normal Gm13. \xe2\x80\x9cPosition\xe2\x80\x9d indicates the position, in Mb of the central bp of a given BAC in the Gm13 pseudomolecule (e.g., Gm13-BAC-3 is at 28.6 Mb in the Gm13 pseudomolecule; see Table S2 for details); whereas \xe2\x80\x9cInterval\xe2\x80\x9d numbers represent the window in Mb between BAC probe \xe2\x80\x9cPosition\xe2\x80\x9d numbers. Thus, in the first event, a chromosome break occurred in the 2.9 Mb interval between sequences corresponding to Gm13-BAC-3 and Gm13-BAC-4, thereby releasing a \xe2\x88\xbc12.9 Mb segment of the Gm13-LA. This segment then became associated with the NOR-containing satellite arm (O2, left chromosome). The yellow arrow in (O1\xe2\x80\x93O3) indicates the polarity of the translocated Gm13-LA fragment; the blue box indicates the possibility that Gm13 may have experienced a pericentromeric inversion involving two breaks. Next, a fragment comprising most of 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of Gm05 (O2, right chromosome) was translocated to the broken end of the Gm13-LA to generate the chromosome forms in O3. The gray arrow in (O2 and O3) indicates the polarity of the translocated Gm05 fragment. The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (A) is also valid for (B). The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (G) is valid for (C\xe2\x80\x93H). The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (K10) is valid for (K\xe2\x80\x93L). The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (N6) is valid for (M) and (N). Due to the short arm length of the satellite chromosome in TL-4 (compare Figure 3D [TL-4] with panel C [G. max W82]), we hypothesized that a fragment of Gm13-LA might be translocated to Gm04 in this line. Indeed, Gm13-BAC-C (Table S2, line 3), which hybridizes near the terminus of Gm13-LA in G. max (Figure 3I3), hybridized to the terminus of the longer arm of the aberrant Gm04 in TL-4 (Figure 3I6). This result both confirmed the involvement of Gm13 in the translocation and indicated the polarity of the segment translocated; specifically, the Gm13-LA terminus now represents the terminus of Gm04-LA in TL-4. To determine how much of the Gm13-LA was translocated onto Gm04 in TL-4, we used Gm13-LA BAC probes (Findley et al. 2010). Gm13-BAC-B represents the most centromere-proximal BAC of a continuous series of BACs that validated the genome sequence assembly of Gm13-LA (Figure 3, J1 and J3; Findley et al. 2010). In TL-4, this BAC also hybridized to the longer arm of the mutant Gm04, near to the Gm04 3\xe2\x80\xb2 terminal probe (Figure 3, J2 and J6). Finally, although not contiguous with the other Gm13 BAC probes, Gm13-BAC-A is one of the most 5\xe2\x80\xb2 terminal BACs available for the Gm13 pseudomolecule; in TL-4, this probe also hybridized very near to the signal for Gm04-BAC-2, on the longer arm of the mutant Gm04 (Figure 3K6). Altogether, our FISH mapping suggests a model (Figure 3, K1 and K2) for a translocation between Gm13 and Gm04 in which a large fragment (>17 Mb) of Gm13 has translocated to the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 terminus of Gm04 in TL-4. Because the most terminal Gm04 BAC tested (Gm04-BAC-2) is positioned at 44.1 Mb of the 49.2 Mb G. max W82 pseudomolecule, and also due to the lack of more centromere-proximal Gm13-LA probes, our analysis does not rule out the possibility of a reciprocal translocation in which a small fragment of Gm04 was transferred to the truncated TL-4 Gm13-LA. Because TL-3 formed the \xe2\x98\x896 conformation in translocation heterozygote combinations with either TL-1 (which involves Gm13 and Gm11; Findley et al. 2010) or TL-4 (which involves Gm13 and Gm04, discussed above), it seemed likely that TL-3 would have a rearranged Gm13. TL-3 had two aberrant chromosomes: one that was truncated at or near to a centromere, so that it appeared to contain only single chromosome arms (Figure 4B, arrowheads; enlarged in Figure 4E), and second that was longer than any other (Figure 4B, arrows; enlarged in Figure 4D). Furthermore, because a normal Gm13, with its characteristic NOR-containing knob (Figure 4C), was not evident in TL-3 chromosome spreads, we hypothesized that this large chromosome was an aberrant form of Gm13. We confirmed this in FISH performed using the Cent-Gm cocktail supplemented with an 18S-rDNA probe (Figure 4A). The centromere color (pale green) of the large chromosome was typical of Gm13 in other G. max cultivars (Figure 4A; enlargement not shown). More definitively, the central, low-intensity DAPI-stained region of the chromosome was targeted by the rDNA probe (Figure 4, D and G; compare to W82 in Figure 4, C and F), indicating that it was the NOR. Thus, the larger aberrant chromosome in TL-3 was a rearranged form of Gm13. To assess the chromosome structure of the TL-3 Gm13, we tested a series of BACs (see Table S2) that span most of Gm13-LA at intervals of \xe2\x88\xbc1 Mb. These probes are shown diagrammatically for G. max W82 in Figure 4, I and K (upper), and by FISH in Figure 4, K1\xe2\x80\x93K10 (middle). The first three, most centromere-proximal probes hybridized to proximal positions along the longer arm of TL-3 Gm13 (Figure 4, L1\xe2\x80\x93L3), as they do in G. max W82 (Figure 4, K1\xe2\x80\x93K3). This preservation of colinearity of probe targets: (NOR)/(centromere)/(Gm13-BACs1-3) in TL-3 indicates a normal chromosome structure around the centromere of the aberrant Gm13 (Figure 4O, blue boxed regions). In contrast, each of the remaining Gm13-LA probes hybridized to the opposite, shorter chromosome arm of TL-3 Gm13 (Figure 4, L4\xe2\x80\x93L10). The fact that Gm13-BAC-4 hybridized closest to the centromere, and Gm13-BAC-11 nearest to the terminus (Figure 4L4) of the shorter arm suggests that an otherwise intact Gm13-LA fragment was broken (between sequences corresponding to Gm13-BAC-3 and -BAC-4) and transposed to the NOR-containing chromosome arm in TL-3 (Figure 4O2). An alternative explanation to account for this novel arrangement would be an inversion (involving two chromosome breaks) of the chromosome region surrounding the Gm13 centromere. The continuity of the NOR signal in the mutant requires that one (the 5\xe2\x80\xb2) break of the inversion would have had to occur in the small knob region at the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 terminus of Gm13. Because the identity of the chromosome segment distal to the point at which Gm13-BAC-3 hybridized in TL-3 Gm13 (Figure 4, L3 and O2) was not resolved by the above analysis, we hypothesized that it might represent the missing arm of the aberrantly small chromosome in the mutant karyotype (Figure 4, B and E). The bright orange centromere labeling of the small chromosome (Figure 4, A and H) indicated that it could be a form of Gm05, or possibly Gm02 or Gm16, each of which is painted orange by the Cent-Gm probe cocktail in multiple G. max and G. soja accessions (Findley et al. 2010, and data not shown). BAC probes derived from near the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end (Gm05-BAC-A) and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end (Gm05-BAC-B) of the Gm05, which label opposite ends of W82 Gm05 (Figure 4M4), hybridized to two different chromosomes in TL-3. Gm05-BAC-A hybridized to the aberrantly small chromosome (Figure 4M6); whereas Gm05-BAC-B hybridized to the longer arm of the aberrant Gm13 (Figure 4M5). The fact that the Gm05-BAC-A\xe2\x80\x93hybridizing chromosome arm, corresponding to the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the Gm05 pseudomolecule, is still associated with the centromere in the mutant indicates that this chromosome was broken on the opposite arm, but close to the Gm05 centromere. Translocation of this Gm05 fragment to a rearranged Gm13 thus accounts for the longer Gm13 arm in TL-3. The orientation of the fragment in Gm13 is indicated by hybridization of the Gm05-BAC-B probe; this probe hybridizes to the distal end of the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of a normal Gm05, but hybridized to the distal end of the TL-3 Gm13-LA. This hypothesis was confirmed using Gm13-BAC-11 in combination with Gm05-BAC-B, BACs that represent 3\xe2\x80\xb2 positions in their respective chromosomes in G. max W82 (Figure 4, N3 and N4), but opposite ends of Gm13 in TL-3 (Figure 4N5). Collectively, these data are consistent with a two-step translocation model (Figure 4, O1\xe2\x80\x93O3). In the first step, a distal fragment of Gm13-LA was transposed to the end of the NOR-containing Gm13-SA. In the second step, most of the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 arm of Gm05 was transposed to the remaining Gm13-LA, resulting in the chromosome forms shown in Figure 4O3. TL-5 formed the \xe2\x98\x896 conformation and exhibited partial pollen sterility in translocation heterozygotes with TL-2, a translocation that we determined (above) involves Gm01 and Gm08. An aberration in one of these two chromosomes was thus likely in TL-5. TL-5 had two aberrant chromosomes: an aberrantly small pair (Figure 5A, arrow; enlarged in Figure 5C) and an aberrantly large pair (Figure 5A, arrowhead; enlarged in Figure 5C). FISH mapping with Gm01 terminal BACs indicated Gm01 to be intact in TL-5 (data not shown). In contrast, Gm08 terminal probes, Gm08-BAC-A (Gm08-LA, Gm08 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end) and Gm08-BAC-E (Gm08-SA, Gm08 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end), did not hybridize to a single TL-5 chromosome (compare Figure 5, E5 and E6 with Figure 5E3). In TL-5, Gm08-BAC-A hybridized near the terminus of the long arm of the aberrantly large chromosome; whereas Gm08-BAC-E hybridized to the longer arm of the aberrantly short chromosome. This indicates the involvement of Gm08 (and not Gm01) in the TL-5 translocation and also accounts for the two aberrant chromosome forms.

This centromere color of this chromosome indicates that it is a rearranged Gm08. Conversely, the Gm08-LA\xe2\x80\xb2 probe (Gm08-BAC-A, labeled \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2, right) hybridized (G6) to the chromosome arm opposite to the one with the Gm02-5\xe2\x80\xb2 probe signal (Gm02-BAC-1, labeled \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2, right).

(Row K) In G. max W82, Gm02-5\xe2\x80\xb2 BAC probe (Gm02-BAC-A, labeled \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d in column 1; red signal, indicated by arrow in K3) and Gm02-3\xe2\x80\xb2 BAC probe (Gm02-BAC-B, labeled \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d in column 1; green signal, indicated by arrowhead in K3) hybridized to opposite ends of Gm02. In TL-6, the two Gm02-BAC probes hybridized to two different chromosomes.

(Row L) In G. max W82 (L4), Gm11-LA BAC probe (Gm11-BAC-1, labeled \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9d in column 1; green signal, indicated by arrowhead in L4) and Gm11-SA BAC probe (Gm11-BAC-2, labeled \xe2\x80\x9c2\xe2\x80\x9d in column 1; red signal, indicated by arrow in L4) hybridized to opposite ends of Gm11. In TL-6, the two Gm11-BAC probes hybridized to two different chromosomes. Gm11-BAC-1 (labeled \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2) hybridized to a chromosome with an orange centromere (green hybridization signal in (L5), indicated by the arrowhead); Gm11-BAC-2 (labeled \xe2\x80\x9c2\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2) hybridized to a chromosome with a dark green centromere (red hybridization signal in (L6), indicated by the arrowhead). (Row M) In TL-6, the Gm02-5\xe2\x80\xb2 probe (Gm02-BAC-A, labeled \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2, left) hybridized (M5) to the chromosome arm opposite to the one with the Gm11-LA probe signal (Gm11-BAC-1, labeled \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2, left). This centromere color of this chromosome indicates that it is a rearranged Gm02. Conversely, the Gm11-SA\xe2\x80\xb2 probe (Gm11-BAC-2, labeled \xe2\x80\x9c2\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2, right) hybridized (M6) to the chromosome arm opposite to the one with the Gm02-3\xe2\x80\xb2 probe signal (Gm02-BAC-B, labeled \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d in column 2, right). This centromere color of this chromosome indicates that it is a rearranged Gm11. (Row N) Translocation model for TL-6. (N1) A segment of 3\xe2\x80\xb2 Gm02 containing sequences corresponding to Gm02-BAC-B was reciprocally exchanged with a segment of Gm11-LA, resulting in the TL-6 chromosome forms shown in (N2). The yellow and gray arrows in all diagrams indicate the presumed, but unverified polarity. In addition, the gray hatching in all TL-6 chromosome diagrams indicates the uncertainty regarding chromosome break positions. The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (A) is also valid for (B). The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (C) is also valid for (D). The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (I) is valid for (J). The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (E6) is valid for (E\xe2\x80\x93G). The 2-\xc2\xb5m scale bar in (M6) is valid for (K\xe2\x80\x93M). To characterize Gm08 in TL-5 and to identify its translocation partner, we examined the mutant karyotype using the two Gm08 BACs in combination with the Cent-Gm cocktail (Figure 5B). The Gm08-BAC-E probe hybridized to a chromosome with a yellow-green labeled centromere (Figure 5D), a color typical of Gm08 in other G. max cultivars (Findley et al. 2010). This result indicated that the smaller chromosome in the TL-5 karyotype is Gm08, because the Gm08 centromere is still associated with the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of Gm08 in the mutant, and also that the breakpoint was on the opposite arm. We then determined how much of the Gm08-LA was translocated to the aberrantly large chromosome using BACs derived from Gm08-LA positions 11.0,14.9, and 23.3 Mb. When tested individually in G. max W82, each of these probes hybridized only to the Gm08-LA (data not shown); when used in combination, 5-6 distinct hybridization signals are detectable on Gm08-LA (Figure 5F3). FISH in TL-5 also produced 5-6 spots, which were restricted to the long arm of the aberrantly large chromosome (Figure 5F6). Hybridization of Gm08-BAC-A near the terminus of the long arm of the large chromosome (Figure 5D) indicates that the fragment containing the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of Gm08-LA represents the chromosome terminus. Because the TL-5 Gm08-SA is intact (due to contiguity between the Gm08-SA probe hybridization and the Gm08 centromere), and also that a large proportion of Gm08-LA is translocated in the mutant, we next determined the identity of the Gm08 translocation partner. The Cent-Gm cocktail painting of the aberrantly large, Gm08-LA-containing chromosome was bright orange (Figure 5D), a color typical for Gm02, or possibly Gm05 or Gm16. We first assessed the structure of TL-5 Gm02 using BAC probes Gm02-BAC-1 and Gm02-BAC-2, which are derived from 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 Gm02 positions, respectively (Findley et al. 2010, Table S2 and data not shown). In G. max W82, these probes hybridized to opposite ends of Gm02 (Figure 5G4). In TL-5, the signals for these BACs hybridized to two different chromosomes: the aberrantly large chromosome and the aberrantly small Gm08. Specifically, the Gm02-BAC-1 signal hybridized to the short arm of the aberrantly large chromosome (Figure 5G6); whereas Gm02-BAC-2 hybridized to the shorter arm of the mutant Gm08 (Figure 5G5). Thus, the translocation partner for Gm08 in TL-5 is Gm02, and furthermore, the translocation is reciprocal. Despite the short length of the truncated Gm08-LA in TL-5, Gm02-BAC-1, which is derived from the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of Gm02, still hybridized to the truncated Gm08 (Figure 5G5). Due to its small size, however, we did not assess the polarity of the translocated Gm02 fragment. Overall, our analysis is consistent with the translocation model shown in Figure 5, H1 and H2, in which a large fragment of Gm08-LA is reciprocally exchanged with a fragment of the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of Gm02. Because TL-6 formed the \xe2\x98\x896 conformation with TL-5, candidate TL-6 translocation chromosomes included Gm02 or Gm08. However, the overall karyotype of TL-6 (Figure 5I) revealed no obvious aberrations, so we relied on FISH with the Cent-Gm cocktail and BAC probes to characterize the mutant. We first tested terminal BAC clones: Gm02-BAC-A and Gm02-BAC-B, which are derived from 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 Gm02 positions, respectively (Figure 5K3 and Table S2). In TL-6, Gm02-BAC-A hybridized to a chromosome with a bright orange-labeled centromere (Figure 5, J and K5), which is typical for G. max Gm02; this also suggested that the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of Gm02 was still associated the Gm02 centromere in the mutant. In contrast, Gm02-BAC-B hybridized to a dark green centromere-containing chromosome (Figure 5K6), which might be Gm11. We therefore assessed the structure of Gm11 in TL-6 using 5\xe2\x80\xb2 pseudomolecule-positioned Gm11-BAC-1 in combination with 3\xe2\x80\xb2 pseudomolecule-positioned Gm11-BAC-2. In G. max W82, these two probes label opposite ends of Gm11 (Figure 5L4). In contrast, in TL-6, the two BACs hybridized to two different chromosomes: Gm11-BAC-2 was associated with the dark green centromere (Figure 5L6), but the Gm11-BAC-2 signal was associated with the aberrant Gm02 (Figure 5L5). Thus, a fragment of Gm11-LA was translocated to the 5-end of Gm02, but the Gm11-SA was still associated with the Gm11 centromere. To verify this, we simultaneously probed the mutant with Gm02- and Gm08-derived BACs (Figure 5, M5 and M6). Indeed, the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 Gm11-derived signal (Gm11-BAC-1) was associated with the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 Gm02-derived signal (Gm02-BAC-A) on a chromosome with an orange centromere (Figure 5M5). Conversely, the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 Gm11-derived signal (Gm11-BAC-2) was associated with 3\xe2\x80\xb2 Gm02-derived signal (Gm02-BAC-B) on a chromosome with dark green centromere (Figure 5M6). These data suggest a model (Figure 5, N1 and N2) for a reciprocal translocation in TL-6 between Gm02 and Gm11, in which a section of the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end-associated Gm02 arm has exchanged with a section of 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end-associated Gm11-LA. A simple but effective FISH-based karyotyping cocktail in combination with genetically anchored, pseudomolecule-derived BACs has enabled us to rapidly characterize five soybean translocations. In the process, we validated all previously detected genetic interactions between elements of a translocation interaction network (Mahama et al., 1999). Critical to this effort was the prior characterization of two elements of the network, TL-1 and TL-2. At the start of our study, we knew that TL-1 involved an exchange between chromosomes 11 and 13 (Palmer and Heer 1984; Mahama et al. 2003; Findley et al. 2010); we also knew that TL-2 involved a rearrangement in chromosome 1 (Gg01; Pappas and Palmer, unpublished results). The sequential identification of individual translocation chromosomes in these and subsequent examined lines permitted us to characterize all translocation chromosomes in the network. For TL-2, FISH-based karyotyping verified the involvement of Gg01 and identified its translocation partner, Gg08. We also determined the involvement of both chromosomes using molecular mapping of SSRs; however, identifying the chromosomal breakpoints using this method was not possible. Pseudo-linkage groups identified by MapMaker included the linkage of the short arm SSRs of both Gg01 and Gg08 (Figure 1), in support of the FISH data. While QuadMap uses an algorithm for assessing linkage groups in lines containing heterozygous translocations (Livingstone et al. 2000; Durrant et al. 2006), it was unable to identify the translocated segments in TL-2. To use molecular mapping and QuadMap to locate the translocation breakpoints, it may be necessary to use a recombinant inbred line of TL-2. Although SSR analysis has long been an important tool for constructing genetic linkage maps (Akkaya et al. 1992; Cregan et al. 1999) and assessing soybean cultivars (Diwan and Cregan 1997), its usefulness in identifying the translocation breakpoints in the TL-2 line is limited. Considering the time and money required to produce a population for mapping, screening SSR loci for polymorphisms, and assessing SSR genotypes, obtaining a plethora of alternative linkage maps identifying several different possible translocation breakpoints can be frustrating. Our FISH analysis of TL-2 circumvented the need for growing a mapping population and facilitated the unambiguous identification of chromosomal segments involved in the TL-2 translocation. The involvement of chromosomes homologous to Gm01 and Gm08 validated the observed lack of genetic interaction of TL-2 with TL-1, TL-3, and TL-4 (Mahama et al., 1999), none of which involve Gm01 or Gm08, and enabled our subsequent identification of the translocation chromosomes in TL-2 interacting lines TL-5 and TL-6. Genetic interaction of TL-5 with TL-2 (Gg01 and Gg08) permitted identification of the first TL-5 translocation chromosome (Gm08, not Gm01); the second (Gm02) was identified through Cent-Gm\xe2\x80\x93based FISH karyotyping. Of the fast-neutron mutants studied, TL-5 appears to be the only one involving a simple reciprocal translocation. The chromosomes identified (Gm02 and Gm08) also validated genetic and cytological data (Mahama et al. 1999), which suggested that TL-5 shared a translocation chromosome (Gm08) with TL-2 (Gm08 and Gm01), but not with TL-1 (Gm13 and Gm11), TL-3 (Gm13 and Gm05) or TL-4 (Gm13 and Gm04). For TL-4, genetic interaction with TL-1 (involving Gm11 and Gm13) permitted identification of the first translocation chromosome (Gm13, and not Gm11); the second (Gm04) was identified through Cent-Gm\xe2\x80\x93based FISH karyotyping. The involvement of Gm13 in the translocation also validated the genetic interaction of TL-4 with TL-3 (below), which also involves Gm13, as well as the lack of interaction (Mahama et al., 1999) with any of the other translocation lines studied (none of which involve Gm04). The genetic interaction (Mahama et al., 1999) of TL-3 with TL-1 (Gm11 and Gm13) also permitted identification of the first translocation chromosome (Gm13, not Gm11); the second chromosome (Gm05) was identified through Cent-Gm\xe2\x80\x93based FISH karyotyping. This analysis validated the lack of genetic interaction of TL-3 with TL-2, TL-5, and TL-6 (Mahama et al., 1999), none of which involve either Gm05 or Gm13. Because TL-3 chromosomes were derived from fast-neutron\xe2\x80\x93bombarded plants, the (minimally) two chromosome breaks (one in Gm13 and one in Gm05) required for this translocation are likely to have occurred simultaneously in the same cell, followed by the action of nonhomologous end-joining repair mechanisms that generated the chromosome forms in TL-3. Of the translocations studied by (Mahama et al. 1999), TL-6, genetically interacted with only one other line, TL-5. Thus, characterization of TL-6 required the prior, sequential characterization of the mutants (translocation chromosomes): TL-5 (Gm08 and Gm02) and TL-2 (Gm08 and Gm01). As demonstrated by these experiments, molecular cytogenetics represents a powerful complement to both classical genetics and genomics. Mitotic and meiotic chromosome FISH continues to be invaluable in genome sequencing efforts. FISH played important roles, for example, in the Solanaceae Genome Project, both in the direction of sequencing efforts, through BAC-based anchoring of contigs (e.g., Stack et al. 2009), a critical step development of minimal tiling path of BACs in development of chromosome pseudomolecules, and in the detection and closure of numerous and significant gaps, in even euchromatic regions of large genomes (e.g., Szinay et al. 2008; Peters et al. 2009). BAC-based FISH can also facilitate integration of molecular marker-based genetic maps with physical maps, because the technique can readily validate (or dispute) chromosome models (e.g., De Lorenzi et al. 2010), which can be weak in domains high in genomic repeat, or in regions with a low density of molecular markers (reviewed in Szinay et al. 2008). The availability of soybean-based karyotyping resources, including anchored BACs (Schmutz et al. 2010) and a repeat-based karyotyping cocktail (Findley et al. 2010) should facilitate the numerous array-based comparative genomic hybridization studies currently underway in soybean. For example, in the analysis of fast-neutron mutagenesis and TILLING (targeted induced local lesions in genomes) populations, FISH can validate deletions and trace the fate (integrity and locations) of duplicated sequences. Soybean-based FISH tools, particularly BACs, due to their potential for significant cross-species hybridization, may also be useful in comparative studies (e.g., Mcclean et al. 2010) of related Glycine species (e.g., wild perennial Glycine species), which may not be sequenced in the near future. Numerous soybean genome resequencing efforts are underway, including those targeting the diversity (Nichols et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2008) in soybean\xe2\x80\x99s wild progenitor, Glycine soja. However, because large-scale chromosome rearrangements may not be easily detectable by genome resequencing (e.g., Kim et al. 2010), FISH-based cytogenetics will undoubtedly maintain its importance by its ability to rapidly assess chromosome structure in the largely uncharacterized wild soybean germplasm collections.

Using standard quantitative genetic methods for deriving breeding values, population variances, and covariances between relatives, we demonstrate that although these approaches are equivalent under Mendelian expression, this equivalence is lost when genomic imprinting is acting. Imprinting introduces both parent-of-origin-dependent and generation-dependent effects that result in differences in the way additive and dominance effects are defined for the various approaches. Further, imprinting creates a covariance between additive and dominance terms absent under Mendelian expression, but the expression for this covariance cannot be derived using a number of the standard approaches for defining additive and dominance terms. Inbreeding also generates such a covariance, and we demonstrate that a modified method for partitioning variances can easily accommodate both inbreeding and imprinting. As with inbreeding, the concept of breeding values has no useful meaning for an imprinted trait. Finally, we derive the expression for the response to selection under imprinting, and conclude that the response to selection for an imprinted trait cannot be predicted from the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation, even when there is no dominance.A gene is imprinted when its level of expression is dependent on the sex of the parent from which it was inherited. For example, insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) is expressed only from the paternal allele in most fetal tissues of eutherian and marsupial mammals, while the maternally inherited allele is inactivated (DeChiara et al. 1991; O\xe2\x80\x99Neill et al. 2000). More generally, imprinting results in nonequivalence of reciprocal heterozygotes, where inheriting an A1 allele from one\xe2\x80\x99s mother and an A2 allele from one\xe2\x80\x99s father gives a different phenotype, on average, than the reverse inheritance pattern. Complex processes of epigenetic regulation are necessary for the repression of one allele while the other is expressed. These processes include allele-specific modifications such as differential DNA methylation, chromatin structure and histone packing, and differences in replication timing of the maternally and paternally inherited genomes (Rand and Cedar 2003). Approximately 234 imprinted genes have been identified in mammals, including 68 in humans, and many of these genes are thought to be involved in traits such as growth and development (Morison et al. 2005). A publication predicting imprinted genes based on sequence characteristics suggests that imprinted loci in the human genome number as high as 156 (Luedi et al. 2007). Recent years have seen an increasing number of statistical methods developed that aim to identify imprinting in quantitative traits. Using QTL mapping, for example, imprinting has been suggested for quantitative traits as diverse as carcass composition, growth, coat color and reproductive traits (de Koning et al. 2001; de Koning et al. 2000; Hager et al. 2009; Hirooka et al. 2001; Knott et al. 1998; Lee et al. 2003; Milan et al. 2002; Quintanilla et al. 2002; Rattink et al. 2000), while general mixed models have demonstrated the involvement of imprinting in traits such as milk yield, litter size, and growth (de Vries et al. 1994; Engellandt and Tier 2002; Essl and Voith 2002; Kaiser et al. 1998; Schaeffer et al. 1989; Stella et al. 2003; Tier and Solkner 1993). The inclusion of imprinting effects in these genetic methods highlights the significance of imprinting to a range of economically important livestock production traits and to human health and disease, as well as the importance of understanding the effect imprinting may have on traditional approaches to modeling quantitative genetic traits. Quantitative traits may be influenced by many genes, the environment, and any number of interactions between them, and models for these traits are correspondingly complex. Nevertheless, we here employ a one-locus, two-allele quantitative genetic model to demonstrate the differences in a number of standard approaches for theoretically defining breeding values, genotypic variance and covariances between relatives. In doing so, we show that genomic imprinting may have a significant effect on the assumptions made in these most minimal models, and is therefore likely to also influence more complex models involving many alleles and multiple genetic loci. We also compare the effects of imprinting and inbreeding on quantitative genetic parameters and predict the response to selection for an imprinted trait.

The table is ordered alphabetically and split into Roman letters, Greek letters, equation simplifications, and subscripts and superscripts. We here present an overview of a number of approaches for deriving quantitative genetic models for imprinting at one locus. Such models are the basis for many quantitative genetic approaches for dissecting genetic and environmental effects in quantitative traits. Following the approach of Spencer (2002), consider an autosomal diallelic locus subject to imprinting, with alleles A1 and A2 at frequency p1 and p2 (= 1 \xe2\x88\x92 p1) respectively in the population. Note that the population under consideration is static, without selection, migration or mutation operating. Assume that on some suitable scale, the genotypic value (Gij for genotype AiAj) of A1A1 homozygotes is 0 and A2A2 homozygotes is 2a. Assuming no maternal effects, writing the maternally inherited allele first, A2A1 heterozygotes have genotypic value a(1+k1) and A1A2 heterozygotes have value a(1+k2), following the notation of Santure and Spencer (2006) (Figure 1). Genotypic values (Gij) for genotypes AiAj under genomic imprinting. In general, imprinting is thought of as complete inactivation of one allele dependent on parental origin, corresponding to k1 = \xe2\x88\x921 and k2 = 1 (complete silencing of the maternal allele), or k1 = 1 and k2 = \xe2\x88\x921 (complete silencing of the paternal allele). More recently, however, imprinting has been treated as a quantitative trait, which implies that maternal or paternal alleles may only be partially inactivated (see, e.g., Naumova and Croteau 2004; Sandovici et al. 2005; Sandovici et al. 2003), and k1 and k2 may take any values in the range [\xe2\x88\x921,1]. Note that if k1 = k2 = 0 then the trait is purely additive, and both reciprocal heterozygotes have a genotypic value midway between the homozygotes. If k1 and k2 are equal but of opposite sign (for example, k1 = \xe2\x88\x921 and k2 = 1, giving complete maternal inactivation) then the locus is subject only to imprinting. However, in the most general case, where k1 and k2 take any values in the range [\xe2\x88\x921,1], we might consider that both imprinting and dominance are acting on the locus, as the mean genotypic value of heterozygotes is not the mean of the homozygotes. With the help of Figure 1, the mean genotypic value over the population is (1)and the total genetic variance is (2)where (3)and (4)(Spencer 2002). We follow a number of approaches in calculating breeding values, components of variance and covariances between relatives. Doing so illustrates that various assumptions made in these approaches are not valid in the presence of imprinting. Five approaches are outlined in the Appendix, and the results of their partitioning breeding values, the corresponding calculation of variances and covariances, and the derivation of covariances between relatives are shown in Tables 2\xe2\x80\x934. In the absence of imprinting, all of these approaches give identical breeding values, variance components, and covariances between relatives. The expressions for these terms in the absence of imprinting are obtained by setting k1 = k2 = k. Importantly, it can be seen that it is only by modifying the least squares regression approach (Approach 2b) can the sex-specific additive and dominance values derived by Spencer (2002) be recovered (Santure and Spencer 2006). The other three approaches (Approaches 2a, 3a, and 3b) fail to incorporate sex effects, and give incorrect results when partitioning the variance components and calculating covariances between relatives. An interesting aspect of the above variance decompositions is the similarity between inbreeding and imprinting, as inbreeding also introduces a covariance between additive and dominance effects (Harris 1964) that may not be partitioned if an incorrect method is used. To investigate this similarity, we incorporate inbreeding into Approach 2b. We represent an inbred population by dividing the population into two groups: a group that represents the expected Hardy-Weinberg proportions, comprising an overall proportion of (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92 f), and a completely homozygous group with no heterozygotes, comprising a proportion f of the population. Thus genotypic frequencies for A1A1, A2A1 and A1A2, and A2A2 genotypes are   each and , respectively. Now the overall population mean incorporating both inbreeding (I) and imprinting is When there is no inbreeding, f = 0, the population is in Hardy-Weinberg proportions, and the mean reduces to  as expected. With no imprinting, the mean reduces to . We assume that the inbreeding coefficient f is stable across generations, so the proportion of heterozygotes does not change. As in Approach 2b, male and female additive and dominance deviations may be calculated separately (Santure and Spencer 2006). For example, the additive effect of inheriting an A1 allele maternally isThe remaining additive effects are Breeding values and dominance deviations may be calculated as in Approach 2b. The total variance for an inbred population with imprinting iswhere  is the total genetic variance for the case of imprinting only (2). When there is complete inbreeding (f = 1), the total variance is (6)and for no inbreeding (f = 0), we recover. (7)The total variance may also be rewritten as (8)and for the case of no imprinting (k1 = k2 = k), the total genetic variance becomes (9)(Harris, 1964), where, (10)and Comparing equations (6) and (7), we can see that in the absence of imprinting and dominance (k1 = k2 = f = 0), the total variance for an inbred population is twice that of an outbred population (k1 = k2 = 0, f = 1), and indeed the effect of inbreeding is linear; an inbreeding coefficient of  yields a total variance  times the variance with no inbreeding. However, for dominance but no imprinting (9), the effect of increasing inbreeding is nonlinear; the population variance may increase or decrease relative to an outbred population depending on the allele frequencies and the value of the dominance coefficient. A similar effect is evident with imprinting; if there is no dominance (i.e., k1 = \xe2\x88\x92k2), the population variance linearly increases with increasing inbreeding, while with both dominance and imprinting  the population variance is a quadratic function of f. Thus, it is dominance but not imprinting which determines the relationship of the population variance with increasing inbreeding. For a highly selfing species, the degree of imprinting may have a large effect on the total population variance. For example, consider a population with  and . Setting k1 = \xe2\x88\x92k2 (imprinting, no dominance), the total variance is 0.20 for  and 0.25 for . Interestingly, the effect of imprinting becomes less pronounced as inbreeding levels increase; for , the total variance increases from 0.18 for  to 0.25 for , while for  the variance increases from 0.23 for  to 0.25 for . The female and male additive variances are (11)and (12)where  and  are the female and male additive variances calculated from Approaches 1 and 2b (Table 3). The female and male dominance variances are (13)and (14)where  is the dominance variance (Approaches 1 and 2b, Table 3). Interestingly, and unlike the pure imprinting case, the dominance variance is different for males and females. The female and male covariances between additive and dominance terms are (15)and (16)where  and  are the female and male covariances between additive and dominance effects (Approaches 1 and 2b, Table 3). When there is no imprinting, the female and male covariances reduce to the same value: Considering that  we can see that  and hence the covariance is strictly negative under inbreeding alone. Recall that under imprinting aloneand(Table 3). Now we may rearrange  to give , so thatand hence , so the average of male and female covariances under inbreeding is also strictly negative. However, if k1 and k2 are of opposite sign, then one of  or  may be positive. Thus, although both imprinting and inbreeding introduce a covariance between additive and dominance effects, it is only the presence of imprinting that allows the covariance in one sex to be positive. Imprinting can therefore have a significant effect on the total genetic variance and on the sex-specific components of variance of an inbred population. We follow the approach of Heywood (2005) to investigate the response of an imprinted quantitative trait to natural selection. To include selection, let the absolute fitness of parent genotype AiAj be  and define the relative fitness wij as  where (18)is the mean fitness. Following Heywood (2005), we consider the special case with the linear fitness function , which gives . We denote mean offspring genotypic values after selection as . We can now write the change in mean trait value from the parent to the offspring generation (the response to selection;  as (19)where , the selection differential, is the covariance between parent relative fitness and genotypic value,  is the change in mean trait value from parent to offspring, and the expectation is taken over parents (Heywood 2005; Price 1970; Price 1972). Heywood (2005) defines  as the mean genotypic value of offspring from parent AiAj before selection, then sets  and, after some algebra, restates (19) as (20)or, alternatively, (21)(Heywood 2005). We now apply this approach to an imprinted quantitative trait. As usual, we need to define both male (paternal) and female (maternal) terms. The absolute fitnesses of the four genotypes areand Relative fitnesses are shown in Table 5, along with the frequency of each genotype and average values of offspring before and after selection. Note that the population mean, variances and covariances  are the same as derived for Approaches 1 and 2b (Table 3). Now the allele frequencies after selection are (23)and For both female and male parents, the mean genotypic value of offspring before selection is equal to the mean genotypic value: The mean values of offspring after selection for female and male parents are: The difference between male and female offspring means after selection is (27)which is zero when there is no imprinting (k1 = k2 = k). This result clearly demonstrates the difference between female and male parents in their effect on offspring means. We derive the full set of covariances and expectations required for equations (20) and (21) in the Appendix. Now, the response to selection is (28)where (29)and It is clear, therefore, that the response to selection is the same for males and females, and is, as expected, related to the population variances and covariances in addition to the selection coefficient t. In the absence of imprinting k1 = k2 = k, , where , and , and our total response to selection becomes (31)(Heywood 2005) whereand How does the magnitude of the response to selection compare to what we would predict if imprinting is ignored, and reciprocal heterozygotes are assumed to have the same genotypic value? Substituting  into (31), we find that the expression for the response to selection is identical to the full expression derived with separate k1 and k2 terms (28). This suggests that even if imprinting is acting, the predicted response to selection is the same whether calculated using separate genotypic values, or using the average of the genotypic values for the two reciprocal heterozygotes. If k1 = \xe2\x88\x92k2 so there is imprinting but no dominance (as the mean heterozygote genotypic value is midway between the homozygote genotypic values; ), expressions (28) and (31) become The response to selection according to the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation is (33)where the narrow sense heritability, h2, is the ratio between the additive and total genetic variance and  as previously. For the case of imprinting, we can see that the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation (34)is only equal to the response to selection (28)when the dominance variance and the male and female covariances between the additive and dominance terms are zero, which requires k1 = k2 = 0. For the case of no imprinting, the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation becomes (35)and is equal to the response to selection (31) when . Therefore, we can see the well-known result that the response to selection and the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation are equal only when the dominance variance is zero, and hence the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation only predicts the response to selection in the absence of dominance, whether the locus is imprinted or not. The difference between the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation (34) and the predicted response to selection (28) is a function dependent on a, t, k1, k2 and p1 (= 1 \xe2\x88\x92 p2). For a dominant trait with no imprinting  the true response to selection (31) is strictly less than that predicted by the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation (35). Similarly, if k1 = \xe2\x88\x92k2 so there is imprinting but no dominance (as the mean heterozygote genotypic value is midway between the homozygote genotypic values), the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation becomes (36)while the true response to selection is Comparing equations (36) and (37), we can see that the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation again overestimates the response to selection for the special case of imprinting but no dominance. For the case of complete inactivation of the maternal or paternal allele , the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation predicts a response double that of the true response. If we include both imprinting and dominance, and let , t = 1, ,  and , the response to selection (28) is also generally less than that predicted by the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation. However, it is interesting to note that if the difference between k1 and k2 is less than , then the predicted response to selection may be the same as or slightly more than that predicted by the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation. Therefore, very small differences in the genotypic values of reciprocal heterozygotes may result in the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation underestimating the response to selection. These results contrast with the derivation of de Vries et al. (1994), who from the covariance of parents and offspring predicted the response to selection for an imprinted trait as (38)where  is defined as the variance due to imprinted genes. We have demonstrated that a simple one-locus two-allele model of genomic imprinting produces large differences in predictions for additive (Table 2) and dominance terms from a number of standard approaches for partitioning the genotypic value of an individual. These approaches are equivalent in the absence of imprinting under standard Mendelian expression (where heterozygotes have equivalent genotypic values and hence k1 = k2). Although all approaches give identical total genetic variance, there are differences in the partitioning of the genetic variance into additive, dominance and covariance terms (Table 3). The major differences in the approaches arise due to differences in how breeding values and additive effects are defined. Approaches 1 and 2b incorporate both sex- and generation-dependent terms, and breeding values are equivalent for these approaches (Table 2). However, Approaches 2a and the regression methods (Approaches 3a and 3b) are unable to partition separate male and female terms. Consider how breeding values are calculated for the different approaches. Approach 1 defines breeding values in terms of allelic contribution to offspring, and breeding values are the same for reciprocal heterozygotes. Genotypic values in Approach 2b are defined in terms of the male or female effect they pass on to offspring, and so include the same sex-specific generation effect as Approach 1. Breeding values are consequently equivalent for reciprocal heterozygotes. The single regression Approach 3a similarly forces genotypic equivalence for the predicted value of reciprocal heterozygotes. In contrast, the other two approaches define breeding values in terms of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s own genotype and the parental origin of alleles in that genotype. As a consequence of imprinting, the parental origin of these alleles has an effect on the genotypic value of individuals and hence reciprocal heterozygotes have different breeding values (Table 2). Under standard Mendelian expression, breeding values are expected to be equivalent whether defined as the sum of additive allelic effects (Approaches 2 and 3) or from the means of offspring (Approach 1). However, differences have been noted where alleles in the population are not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Ewens 1979), in relation to populations with nonrandom mating and inbreeding (Falconer 1985; Fisher 1941; Templeton 1987), and as a result of population subdivision (Goodnight 2000). Genomic imprinting represents a distinct phenomenon causing differences in the definition of additive effects between the approaches we have investigated. The difference of these approaches in predicted breeding values mirrors the conclusion of Falconer (1985), who found that, \xe2\x80\x9cthe concept of breeding value [has] no useful meaning when mating is not random.\xe2\x80\x9d In addition, genomic imprinting introduces a covariance between breeding values and dominance deviations (Spencer 2002). This covariance between additive and dominance effects has only been noted previously when a population is inbred (Harris 1964). In comparing these approaches, we assumed that Approach 1 gives us \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect\xe2\x80\x9d values for population parameters. Approach 1 is the most time-intensive method for partitioning genetic variance because it requires derivation of mating tables to give offspring mean values. However, this approach does allow separate calculation of male and female variances and covariances, which is of great value when considering offspring-parent and halfsib covariances in real populations. Approach 2a was able to retrieve the additive variance, but the true additive-by-dominance covariance was included in the expression for the dominance variance. By defining additive terms specific to male and female inheritance, we were able to \xe2\x80\x9crescue\xe2\x80\x9d this method to include separate breeding values and dominance deviations, and their corresponding variances, for the two sexes (Approach 2b). Of particular note is that Approach 2b was the only approach able to recover the Approach 1 covariance between additive and dominance effects. Defining separate male and female dominance terms  and  includes a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneration\xe2\x80\x9d effect that is not accounted for in Approaches 2a and 3. Approach 1 is based on calculating breeding values and dominance deviations that relate to the following generation because we use offspring means in their calculation. The equivalence of Approach 1 with Approach 2b is a reassurance that defining separate male and female dominance terms is an appropriate measure to include a sex and generation effect in this approach. A closer investigation of Approaches 1 and 2b is presented for a model including maternal genetic effects and genomic imprinting (Santure and Spencer 2006). It is well known that parental effects may have a significant effect on the phenotype of offspring. It is important for methods to include such effects, but it is not easy to imagine how the linear regression models (Approaches 3a and 3b) could be extended to allow for parental effects such as imprinting and maternal genetic effects. It is interesting to assess how different these approaches are in their estimation of variance and covariance components. The numerical examples in Table 6 contrast genetic variance components and resemblances between relatives for the different approaches for two scenarios, one where alleles are largely paternally inactivated, and one where maternally inherited alleles are largely inactivated. We assume that phenotypic (and hence genotypic) values range from 0 to 1 . We can see that, as one would expect, paternal inactivation increases the covariance between mothers and offspring and half sibs sharing a mother, relative to fathers and offspring and half sibs sharing a father respectively (and vice versa) (from the correct expressions using Approaches 1 and 2b). Approach 3a underestimates the true additive variance, while Approaches 2a, 3a, and 3b all underestimate the dominance variance. As discussed previously, Approaches 2a, 3a, and 3b are not able to calculate the covariance between additive and dominance effects (Table 6). This covariance between breeding values and dominance deviations is included in the expressions for resemblance between parents and offspring and full sibs and is likely to play a large role in identifying quantitative traits that are influenced by imprinted loci (Spencer 2002). By using Approach 2b, we were able to extend the imprinting model to include inbreeding. As previously noted, inbreeding also creates differences in how breeding values are defined (see Falconer 1985) and creates a covariance between additive and dominance effects that is not present in a randomly mating population (Harris 1964). Interestingly, we have demonstrated that in the presence of both inbreeding and imprinting, the dominance variance is different for males and females. The covariance between additive and dominance terms is strictly negative under inbreeding alone, and is on average negative when averaged over males and females under imprinting alone. However, it is only imprinting that allows the covariance in one sex to be positive. The sex-based differences introduced by imprinting represent an important difference between the effects of inbreeding and imprinting on the derivation of quantitative genetic models. Finally, we derived the full expression for the response to selection of an imprinted trait. For an imprinted trait, the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation generally overestimates the true response to selection, a result well established when a trait is known to exhibit dominance. Excitingly, we have demonstrated that even in the absence of dominance, where on average reciprocal heterozygotes have a genotypic value midway between the two homozygotes, the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation does not predict the true response to selection. This result has very great significance for predicting the reaction to selection in natural populations\xe2\x80\x94if heterozygotes are not distinguished and we only measure additive variance, we are very likely to overestimate the expected change in mean trait values between generations. Detecting genomic imprinting of a quantitative trait using, for example, covariances between relatives, is likely to be difficult given the large sampling variance of such covariances and the possibility of maternal effects increasing the covariance of offspring with their mothers (Santure and Spencer 2006; Spencer 2002). However, the derivations above do suggest that a number of different quantities may provide indicators for the influence of imprinting, such that if one approach lacks power to distinguish imprinting from nonimprinting, another avenue may provide fruitful. For example, 1) large differences in the covariance of offspring with their mothers compared to fathers (particularly if the covariance with fathers is greater), 2) the existence of a non-zero covariance between additive effects and dominance deviations (particularly if there is a difference in sign between male and female covariances), and 3) a smaller than expected response to selection based on the breeder\xe2\x80\x99s equation (particularly when there is little evidence for dominance) all provide good evidence for the influence of genomic imprinting on a quantitative trait. A large range of methods is presently available for assessing the role of imprinting in complex and quantitative traits. These methods follow the broad spectrum of genetic approaches for dissecting complex traits, from general mixed models, use of covariances between relatives and identification of parent of origin effects in phenotype inheritance for traits without genotypic information available; to the marker-based approaches of linkage mapping, association studies and QTL mapping. A number of these approaches utilize variance component estimation, resemblances between relatives or differences in the phenotypic values of heterozygotes; quantities discussed in this manuscript. Such approaches are invaluable in the dissection of quantitative traits, and we encourage researchers to employ an approach that can successfully incorporate genomic imprinting into a model of the quantitative trait of interest.

A.W.S. was the recipient of a Bright Future Enterprise Doctoral Scholarship, supported by Livestock Improvement Corporation, the New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology and the Tertiary Education Commission. This approach is based on using the genotypic values of parents and offspring to calculate genotypic deviations, population breeding values and dominance deviations, components of variance, and covariances between relatives. The genotypic deviation of a genotype is the difference between its genotypic value (Gij) and the population mean . The breeding value is defined as twice the difference between the mean genotypic value of the class\xe2\x80\x99s offspring and the population mean, and can be derived separately for males and females (Spencer 2002). The dominance deviation for a genotypic class is the difference between the genotypic deviation and the breeding value. The genetic variance of the population is the variance of the genotypic deviations, male and female additive genetic variances are the respective variances of their breeding values and the male and female dominance genetic variances are the variances of the male and female dominance deviations (Spencer 2002). Resemblances between relatives are calculated from first principles with the help of a mating table. Based on a general least squares approach to calculate population breeding values, dominance deviations, components of variance and covariances between relatives. The genotypic value Gij for genotype AiAj is the sum of the population mean  plus additive  and dominance  effects: where  is the average additive effect of inheriting an Ai allele from the mother,  is the average effect of inheriting an Aj allele from the father and  is the remaining dominance term (also see Santure and Spencer 2006). Note that here \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d represents either of an A1 or A2 allele in the genotype. Breeding values are defined as the sum of additive effects of alleles for each genotype, for example the breeding value of the A1A2 genotype is . The additive variance is the variance of the additive allelic effects, while the dominance variance is the variance of the dominance deviations. By definition, the covariance between additive allelic and dominance effects is zero. In the absence of separate female and male variances, we follow Fisher (1918) and define the covariances between relatives as sums of additive and dominance variances. Approach 2a (above, and in Santure and Spencer 2006) calculated total additive and dominance effects and did not allow separate calculation of female and male additive and dominance variances as was possible in Approach 1. By treating individuals as parents in terms of the alleles that they will pass onto offspring in the next generation, we can red",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fine the genotypic value of an individual as the sum of additive effects inherited by its offspring, plus the population mean and a sex-specific dominance deviation (Santure and Spencer 2006). In using these definitions, we partition the additive and dominance terms into those specific to male and female inheritance. Now the partitioning of the genotypic value becomes different for males and females: where the extra subscript on  indicates female (f) and male (m) dominance effects, defined as and Male and female breeding values are then defined as the sum of male and female additive effects; The male and female additive genetic variances are the variances of male and female additive effects, dominance genetic variances are the variances of the dominance deviations, and the covariance between dominance deviations and breeding values is similarly calculated separately for males and females. Covariances between relatives are then calculated following Spencer (2002) as sums of additive, dominance and covariance terms. An alternative approach is to follow a regression method, expressing the genotypic value Gij of the AiAj genotype using least squares regression (Fisher 1918): based on the relationship between the number of copies of the A2 allele in the genotype and the genotypic value, we may define Gij as the sum of a predicted regression value  and a residual error corresponding to a dominance deviation . The predicted regression value may be further decomposed into the mean of the genotypes  plus additive effects , where additive effects are linear terms dependent on the number of A1 and A2 alleles in the genotype (N1 and N2 = (2 \xe2\x88\x92 N1) respectively), so that Breeding values, dominance terms, variances, and covariances are calculated as in Approach 2a. By definition, the covariance between additive and dominance terms is zero. Alternatively, we may extend to a multiple regression approach to dissect the genotypic value into additive and dominance components. Using matrix notation, we can express the genotypic value as where Gij is the matrix of genotypic values, X is an incidence matrix,  is the vector of the intercept () and the two parental partial regression coefficients  and and  is the vector of dominance effects: The terms  and  may then be estimated using a generalized least squares approach, so that where is the matrix of genotypic frequencies. Additive effects for each genotype are defined as the difference between the genotypic value and the sum of the population mean and dominance effect. Breeding values, dominance terms, variances and covariances are calculated as in Approach 2a. By definition, the covariance between additive and dominance terms is zero. We here derive the full set of covariances and expectations which, in addition to equations (22)\xe2\x80\x93(26), are required to describe the response to selection of an imprinted trait [equations (20) and (21)]. The covariances between genotypic values before and after selection areand The covariance between selection coefficients and genotypic values after selection are Thus, although the mean values of offspring after selection for female and male parents differ, the relationship between selection coefficients and the difference in genotypic values before and after selection are the same for the offspring of female and male parents. Other covariances are shown below Now we can find the components of the response to selection. Recalling equations (20) and (21), the components of equation (20) for females are (39) (40) (41) (42) (43)and similarly, the components of (20) for males are Interestingly,  \xe2\x80\x94the covariance between selection coefficients and the change in mean genetic value before and after selection\xe2\x80\x94is the same for offspring of male and female parents. Then we find that the male and female sum of equation (20) components are (49)where (50)and Hence For equation (21), the extra terms we need to define are  for males and females, and : (52) (53)and (54)and as expected, the sum of equation (21) components for females and males is Communicating editor: Mark Johnston This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Unported License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium," provided the original work is properly cited.'""","['Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand', '‡National Research Centre for Growth and Development, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand', 'Department of Zoology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand']","['Corresponding author: Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S10 2TN, United Kingdom.\u2003']","['breeder’s equation', 'correlations between relatives', 'breeding value', 'additive effect', 'parental effect']",['asanture@gmail.com'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"['Anne Kloimwieder', 'Fred Winston']","July 11, 2011.",A Screen for Germination Mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"b'Spore germination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a process in which a quiescent cell begins to divide. During germination, the cell undergoes dramatic changes in cell wall and membrane composition, as well as in gene expression. To understand germination in greater detail, we screened the S. cerevisiae deletion set for germination mutants. Our results identified two genes, TRF4 and ERG6, that are required for normal germination on solid media. TRF4 is a member of the TRAMP complex that, together with the exosome, degrades RNA polymerase II transcripts. ERG6 encodes a key step in ergosterol biosynthesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate the complex nature of germination and two genes important in the process.In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, unfavorable growth conditions, specifically the absence of nitrogen and the presence of a nonfermentable carbon source, trigger MATa/MAT\xce\xb1 diploid cells to undergo meiosis, forming a tetrad with four spores. During meiosis, extensive changes in transcription and histone modifications occur (Chu et al. 1998; Govin et al. 2010a; Govin et al. 2010b; Krishnamoorthy et al. 2006; Primig et al. 2000). Furthermore, a special spore cell wall is formed as cells go through meiosis (reviewed in Neiman 2005). Beginning in meiosis II, the prospore membrane begins to form from a collection of vesicles that flatten out to form a double membrane. The sites of prospore membrane formation are the four meiotic spindle pole bodies, which nucleate microtubules during the first meiotic division. As meiosis II proceeds, so does spore formation, as the prospore membranes expand to enclose each new haploid nucleus. After nuclear division is complete, the prospore membrane closes and spore wall synthesis begins between the two layers of the prospore membrane. The spore cell wall has two inner layers, composed mainly of mannan and beta-glucan, and two outer layers, composed mainly of chitosan and dityrosine. This is in contrast to the vegetative cell wall, which contains only two layers, composed mainly of beta-glucan and mannan. The spore cell wall, especially the two outer layers, provides protection against adverse conditions. Spores are largely transcriptionally and translationally inert until the return to favorable growth conditions, when they undergo germination and resume vegetative growth (Brengues et al. 2002; Joseph-Strauss et al. 2007). In S. cerevisiae very little is known about germination, although it is clearly an important developmental process. The ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway has been shown to be important for germination in S. cerevisiae (Herman and Rine 1997), and a recent study showed that the transcription factor Ume6 is also required for germination in S. cerevisiae (Strich et al. 2010). Germination has also been studied in other fungi, such as Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa. These studies have also implicated the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (Osherov and May 2001; Truesdell et al. 1999), the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway (Bruno et al. 1996), and the Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated signaling pathway (Kim et al. 1998; Shaw and Hoch 2000). The transcriptional program that occurs in S. cerevisiae during germination can be divided into two stages: first, spores respond to glucose, and second, they respond to other nutritional components, such as amino acids (Joseph-Strauss et al. 2007). Gene expression during germination shares many characteristics with exit from other resting states, such as stationary phase. Like these states, germination requires large transcriptional changes in the cell, with about one-sixth of the genome undergoing transcriptional changes (Joseph-Strauss et al. 2007). Some of these changes in gene expression include the induction of genes associated with protein translation such as rRNA processing genes and ribosomal proteins and the repression of genes associated with the absence of an optimal carbon source such as proteasome and stress genes (Joseph-Strauss et al. 2007; Martinez et al. 2004; Radonjic et al. 2005). Given the importance of germination, we wanted to identify genes required for this process. To do this, we screened the S. cerevisiae deletion set for germination mutants. Our results identified two genes, TRF4 and ERG6. TRF4 encodes a member of the TRAMP complex that, together with the exosome, degrades RNA polymerase II transcripts (Lacava et al. 2005). ERG6 encodes a step of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. Ergosterol is a sterol that plays an important role in membrane fluidity (Valachovic et al. 2006). For both mutants, significant germination defects are observed on solid media but not in liquid media. Taken together, our results suggest that multiple functions are likely required for germination and these respond to specific environmental conditions.'","b'Spore germination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a process in which a quiescent cell begins to divide.

Taken together, our results suggest that multiple functions are likely required for germination and these respond to specific environmental conditions. Except when otherwise noted, all S. cerevisiae strains (Table 1) are derivatives of an S288C strain with three single nucleotide polymorphisms from the SK1 background, in the genes MKT1 and TAO3, and in the promoter region of RME1, that increase sporulation of S288C to near SK1 levels (Deutschbauer and Davis 2005). This strain background will be referred to as SK288C. Capital letters denote wild type genes, lowercase letters denote mutant alleles, and \xce\x94 indicates a complete open reading frame deletion. To create erg6\xce\x94::KanMX and the other deletion alleles in SK288C background, PCR-mediated disruption of the entire open reading frame was used (Goldstein and Mccusker 1999; Sikorski and Hieter 1989). Deletions were initially made in diploids to create a heterozygote, followed by sporulation to recover haploid deletion mutants, and mating of the haploid segregants to obtain homozygous deletions. All deletions were confirmed by PCR. The SK1 alleles in the SK288C strains were confirmed by sequencing. Media and basic yeast techniques have been described previously (Rose et al. 1990). YPD medium (Rose et al. 1990) was the standard rich medium used in the germination and growth tests. A collection of diploid yeast strains containing homozygous deletions of every nonessential gene (Giaever et al. 2002) was screened for defects in germination or sporulation by screening for strains unable to produce viable cells after meiosis and exposure to ether. The collection was spotted onto YPD plates, allowed to grow for 2 days at 30\xc2\xb0C, scored for growth, and replica plated onto 1% potassium acetate sporulation plates. After 7 days, the sporulation plates were lightly replica plated to YPD and immediately treated with ether vapors. To treat cells with ether vapors, open plates were placed face down over liquid ether in a sealed container for 40 min. This treatment killed all vegetative cells, leaving only spores, which are ether resistant. Plates were then grown at room temperature for 3 days and scored for growth. Strains with wild-type growth initially and severely reduced growth after ether treatment were identified as candidate sporulation or germination mutants. The screen was performed three times. Mutants that were identified in at least two of three screens (supporting information, Table S1) were selected for further analysis. To focus on germination, those candidates that had been previously identified as meiotic or sporulation mutants were eliminated from further analysis (Deutschbauer et al. 2002; Enyenihi and Saunders 2003; Marston et al. 2004; Rabitsch et al. 2001). Next, the remaining candidates were tested for their ability to sporulate. To do this, candidates were inoculated into 1 ml of YPD medium and grown to saturation overnight. The next day, 9 ml of YP-Acetate (YPA) medium was added and cultures were again grown overnight to saturation. The cultures were pelleted at 4000 rpm, washed with 10 ml dH2O, and then inoculated into 10 ml of 0.3% potassium acetate sporulation medium and allowed to sporulate for 7 days. After 7 days the number of tetrads was counted to assess sporulation levels. Candidates with greater than 7% tetrads in the culture were dissected to test for a potential germination defect. Candidates were determined to have a putative germination defect if there was no or little growth of tetrads after 2 days at 30\xc2\xb0C, as compared to wild-type. Cells were inoculated and grown to saturation overnight. The next day, cells were diluted and grown to approximately 2 \xc3\x97 106 cells/ml in YPD medium. Then, for at least four generations, cell number was determined each hour using a hemacytometer. Cells were in the logarithmic phase for the entire time course. Doubling times were calculated using linear regression with a semi-log plot. Yeast strains were first sporulated as follows. Strains were purified on YPD plates, and single colonies were inoculated into 1 ml of YPD medium and grown to saturation overnight. These cultures were then used to inoculate 10 ml of YPA medium. Cultures were again allowed to grow to saturation overnight. Cultures in YPA medium were pelleted at 4,000 rpm for 5 min at 4\xc2\xb0C, washed with 10 ml dH2O, and inoculated into 10 ml of 0.3% potassium acetate sporulation medium. After 2 days, sporulation cultures were checked for tetrads. Cultures with greater than 90% sporulation were then counted and 2 \xc3\x97 107 cells were pelleted for 2 min at 3000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded and 50 \xce\xbcl of 0.5 mg/ml zymolyase in 1M sorbitol was added. After 30 min at room temperature, 100 \xce\xbcl of 0.5% Triton-X was added and spores were mixed using a vortex. This cell suspension was then added to 2 ml of YPD to create a final cell concentration of 1 \xc3\x97 107 cells/ml. Cells were monitored each hour for at least 6 hr. At each time point, the number of budding cells was counted as a measure of germination. At least 100 cells were counted at each time point. Ten microliters of sporulation culture was added to 50 \xc2\xb5l of 0.5 mg/ml zymolyase in 1 M sorbitol and left at room temperature for 10 min. One milliliter of dH2O was added, and 20 \xc2\xb5l of this cell suspension was plated in a line on a YPD plate. Wild-type spores and mutant spores were plated on the same plate directly next to one another. Ten tetrads were then dissected for each. These spores were then checked every 30 min for at least 12 hr beginning at 4 hr. The initial time when the bud could first be discerned was recorded as the time to germination. The cells were then followed for two subsequent cell divisions, again counting the time to bud as one complete cell cycle. After each cell division the cells were separated from each other by micromanipulation and moved to a new location on the plate to allow identification of the mother and daughter of each division. Spores were purified by gradient centrifugation using a previously described method (Rockmill et al. 1991). For each purification, a single colony from a YPD plate was used to inoculate 10 ml of YPD liquid which was grown to saturation overnight. Each 10 ml culture was then used to inoculate 200 ml of YPA medium (10 ml into 200 ml) and this culture was grown to saturation overnight. The YPA culture was centrifuged in a Jouan CT 4 22 in a swing out rotor at 4000 rpm for 5 min at 4\xc2\xb0C, the cell pellet was washed with 200 ml dH2O, and the washed cells were used to inoculate 400 ml of 0.3% potassium acetate sporulation medium. After 2 days, each sporulation culture was checked for tetrads. Cultures with greater than 90% sporulation were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm. Per gram of cells, 5 ml of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 2 \xce\xbcl concentrated mercaptoethanol, and 0.8 mg of 0.5 mg/ml zymolyase in 1 M sorbitol were added and cultures were shaken at 30\xc2\xb0C, 190 rpm for 4 hr, dissociating tetrads into single spores. After 4 hr, 5 ml of 0.5% Triton-X were added per gram. Spores were then washed three times with 5 ml 0.5% Triton-X, pelleted each time for 5 min at 4000 rpm. After washes, the resulting pellet was resuspended in 2-3 ml of 0.5% Triton-X to generate a spore suspension of no greater than 5 ml. Percoll gradients were prepared by layering from the bottom 9 ml of each of the following four mixtures in 40 ml Sorvall tubes: (1) 8 ml Percoll, 1 ml 0.5% Triton-X, 1 ml 2.5 M sucrose; (2) 7 ml Percoll, 2 ml 0.5% Triton-X, 1 ml 2.5 M sucrose; (3) 6 ml percoll, 3 ml 0.5% Triton-X, 1 ml 2.5 M sucrose; and (4) 5 ml Percoll, 4 ml 0.5% Triton-X, 1 ml 2.5 M sucrose. On top of this gradient, 1.5 ml of the spore suspension was layered. These gradients were then spun at 10,000 rpm at 4\xc2\xb0C for 1 hr in a SA-600 rotor in a Sorvall centrifuge. After centrifugation, the top three layers, consisting of vegetative cells and debris were removed and discarded. The remaining spore layer, consisting of >99.9% spores, was then removed by pipette and washed three times with 30 ml 0.5% Triton-X. After the washes, spores were re-suspended in 5 ml 0.5% Triton-X and stored at 4\xc2\xb0C. Percoll was purchased from MP Biomedical. Purified spores were diluted to between 1-5 \xc3\x97 107 cells/ml and sonicated to disperse the spores. Two small agar pads were created by dissolving 0.1 g of low-melt agarose into 5 ml SC-complete medium and plating approximately 1 ml sandwiched between two cover slips. Then, 0.5 \xce\xbcl of wild-type or deletion mutant cells were spread on separate agar pads. These agar pads were then placed cell side down on a glass slide so that the spores were sandwiched between the glass slide and the agar. The glass slide was contained in a small dish to prevent the agar from drying out. Cells were then monitored on a Nikon TE2000 microscope with Perfect Focus, 100\xc3\x97 NA 1.4 objective at 30\xc2\xb0C for at least 12 hr by image capture every 5 min. After image capture cells were individually tracked for germination by the appearance of the first bud. Cells were also monitored for two subsequent cell divisions by bud appearance. To identify genes required for germination, we performed a screen of the S. cerevisiae diploid deletion set to identify mutants defective for this process (described in Materials and Methods). Because our screen would identify both meiosis and germination mutants, we removed from consideration any meiosis or sporulation mutants identified in previous screens (Deutschbauer et al. 2002; Enyenihi and Saunders 2003; Marston et al. 2004; Rabitsch et al. 2001). Our screen was performed three times, each time identifying an average of 77 candidates, with an overlap of approximately 56% with at least one of the other two screens. The 58 mutants identified in at least two of the three screens were included in secondary analysis (Figure 1). Results from three screens for germination mutants. A Venn diagram shows results from the three screens for germination mutants. Each of the 58 candidates was tested for sporulation and germination. Of these, twelve mutants sporulated and produced complete tetrads at a sufficient level (above 7% sporulation) to analyze possible germination defects (Table 2). Four of the twelve mutants appeared to have a germination defect: trf4\xce\x94, erg6\xce\x94, ybl083c\xce\x94, and yml013c-a\xce\x94. Of the mutants that exhibited a sporulation defect, several seemed to be functionally related in mRNA export, Cdc48 function, or ESCRTIII complex. To study the germination phenotype of each deletion in a genetic background in which sporulation occurs at a high frequency, each deletion was constructed in the SK288C strain background (see Materials and Methods). In this strain background, two of the candidates, trf4\xe2\x88\x86 and erg6\xe2\x88\x86, showed germination defects after dissection of tetrads on rich (YPD) plates. TRF4 encodes a member of the TRAMP complex, that together with the exosome, degrades RNA polymerase II transcripts (Wyers et al. 2005). ERG6 encodes a step of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway (Gaber et al. 1989). To assess the trf4\xce\x94 germination phenotype, both homozygous wild-type and trf4\xce\x94/trf4\xce\x94 diploids were sporulated and tetrads were dissected on YPD plates. Germination was assessed by comparing the growth of the wild-type and trf4\xce\x94 strains after germination and after normal vegetative growth. As can be seen in Figure 2, trf4\xce\x94 spores exhibit a growth defect compared with wild-type (Figure 2A). When vegetatively growing cells are grown on a YPD plate, the wild-type and trf4\xce\x94 strains grow at a more comparable level, although there is a mild growth impairment for trf4\xce\x94 (Figure 2B). The more severe growth defect after germination indicates that trf4\xe2\x88\x86 cells have a germination defect on solid media. Growth of trf4\xce\x94 mutants on solid media. (A) Wild-type and homozygous trf4\xce\x94 diploids were sporulated and dissected on YPD plates. Shown are the germination plates, each after 2 d of incubation at 30\xc2\xb0C. (B) Wild-type and trf4\xce\x94 haploid strains were streaked for single colonies on YPD medium and were incubated for 2 d at 30\xc2\xb0C. To assay the trf4\xce\x94 germination defect in a more quantitative fashion, germination time courses were performed in liquid YPD medium. To do this, purified spores were inoculated into liquid YPD medium and monitored over a time course of six hours. At each hour, the number of budding cells was counted as a measure of germination. Our results (Figure 3A) show that, in liquid YPD medium, germination occurred asynchronously, over approximately 3 hr for both wild-type and trf4\xce\x94 spores. Furthermore, the kinetics of appearance of budded cells was similar between the two strains, although the number of germinating trf4\xce\x94 spores was less than the number for wild-type throughout the time course, suggesting that fewer trf4\xce\x94 spores were able to germinate. We also measured the generation time for wild-type and trf4\xe2\x88\x86 mutants growing vegetatively in YPD liquid medium and found that the trf4\xce\x94 mutant had a modest growth defect (Figure 3B). From these results, we are unable to conclude that trf4\xce\x94 germination in liquid YPD medium is slower; however, trf4\xce\x94 does cause a decrease in the frequency of spores that can germinate in both liquid and solid YPD. Analysis of trf4\xce\x94 germination and growth in liquid media. (A) Wild-type and trf4\xe2\x88\x86 spores were inoculated into YPD liquid media. The number of budding cells was counted each hour as a measure of germination. Shown here is the average \xc2\xb1 SE of five experiments. (B) Wild-type and trf4\xe2\x88\x86 strains in logarithmic phase were counted every hour to determine their generation times in liquid media. Shown is the average \xc2\xb1 SE of three experiments. To further analyze trf4\xce\x94, pedigree analysis was performed to measure germination time on solid medium. In this analysis, spores were dissected to specific positions on a YPD plate. Each spore was then monitored for the time to germinate. In addition, two additional rounds of cell division were monitored. As shown in Figure 4, trf4\xce\x94 spores germinate more slowly than wild-type on YPD plates. First, compared with wild-type, many spores do not germinate at all (Figure 4A). Among the cells that do germinate, the trf4\xce\x94 mutants averaged over an hour longer than wild-type (6 hr vs. 4.7 hr; Figure 4B). In contrast to the longer time for trf4\xce\x94 spores to germinate, there was no trf4\xce\x94 growth defect observed in the subsequent generations that were monitored (Figure 4B). In fact, the trf4\xce\x94 cells appeared to divide slightly faster than wild-type. In conclusion, on YPD plates, trf4\xce\x94 mutants appear to germinate at lower frequency and more slowly than wild-type. Pedigree analysis of germination in a trf4\xce\x94 mutant. (A) Percent of nongerminating spores after tetrad analysis of wild-type and trf4\xce\x94/trf4\xce\x94 diploids. Shown are the average times \xc2\xb1 SE for three experiments. (B) Time to complete germination and initial cell divisions on solid media. Shown are the average times \xc2\xb1 SE for three experiments for germination and early cell divisions after germination. The times indicate the first detectable appearance of a bud. The second mutant that showed a germination defect was erg6\xce\x94. Because previous studies have suggested that particular auxotrophies could affect the growth of erg6\xce\x94 mutants (Boer et al. 2008; Gaber et al. 1989), all erg6\xce\x94 experiments were done with prototrophic strains. To examine the effect of an erg6\xce\x94 mutation on germination, an SK288C homozygous erg6\xce\x94 diploid was sporulated and tetrads were dissected. Our results show that erg6\xce\x94 spores exhibit a severe growth defect after dissection on YPD plates compared to a wild-type diploid (Figure 5A). Based on colony size, this defect is unlikely to be caused by poorer vegetative growth (Figure 5B). Growth of erg6\xce\x94 mutants on solid media. (A) Wild-type and homozygous erg6\xce\x94 diploids were sporulated and dissected on YPD plates. Shown are the germination plates, each after 2 d of incubation at 30\xc2\xb0C. (B) Wild-type and erg6\xce\x94 haploid strains were streaked for single colonies on YPD medium and were incubated for 2 d at 30\xc2\xb0C. To examine the effect of erg6\xce\x94 on germination in liquid YPD medium, time courses were performed using purified spores, monitoring germination by the timing of bud emergence. As shown in Figure 6A, erg6\xce\x94 spores exhibited a defect in germination, both in terms of the rate at which buds appeared and the percentage of spores that budded. To determine whether the germination defect might be related to slower growth of erg6\xce\x94 mutants, the generation time in liquid YPD was measured. Our results show that erg6\xce\x94 mutants do have a longer generation time in liquid medium (Figure 6B). The slower growth of erg6\xce\x94 in liquid YPD might account for some of the differences seen for the rate of germination, although it would not account for the lower frequency of spores that are able to germinate. Analysis of erg6\xce\x94 germination and growth in liquid media. (A) Wild-type and erg6\xe2\x88\x86 spores were inoculated into YPD liquid media. The number of budding cells was counted each hour as a measure of germination. Shown here is the average of \xc2\xb1 SE of three experiments. (B) Wild-type and erg6\xe2\x88\x86 strains in logarithmic phase were counted every hour to determine their generation times time in liquid media. Shown is the average \xc2\xb1 SE of three measurements. To gain an additional view of the germination defect in erg6\xce\x94 mutants, individual spores on SC agar were used for live cell imaging, with pictures taken every 5 min at multiple positions for both the wild-type and erg6\xce\x94 spores. Sample frames are shown in Figure 7, while a movie is shown as Figure S1. Using these images, each spore was monitored for the time to germinate. From this analysis, erg6\xce\x94 spores averaged a time to bud of 7.4 \xc2\xb1 0.77 hr, while wild-type averaged 5.4 \xc2\xb1 0.77 hr, a statistically significant difference (P = 0.0019) and greater than the vegetative growth difference as judged by colony size (Figure 5B) or by measurement of generation time (Figure 6B). Taken together, these analyses show that erg6\xe2\x88\x86 mutants exhibit a germination defect on solid media. Live cell imaging. Sample frames from live cell imaging of wild-type (A\xe2\x80\x93C, G\xe2\x80\x93J) and erg6\xce\x94 (D\xe2\x80\x93F, K\xe2\x80\x93N) cells. Time points are as follows: A and D, 2 hr; B and E, 6 hr; C and F, 8 hr; G and K, 10 hr; H and L, 12 hr; I and M, 14 hr; and J and N, 20 hr and 20 min. In this study, we screened for S. cerevisiae germination mutants, leading to the identification of two genes, TRF4 and ERG6. Both trf4\xe2\x88\x86 and erg6\xe2\x88\x86 mutants exhibit germination defects on solid media, while the results are less clear in liquid media. On solid media, the trf4\xce\x94 mutants had a lower percentage of spores able to germinate, and those that did, took significantly longer. While the erg6\xce\x94 mutant spores germinated at a frequency close to that of wild-type, they took longer and, interestingly, exhibited slower growth for at least the first two cell divisions after germination. A previous screen for germination mutants also identified trf4\xe2\x88\x86 mutants, although this screen was done in liquid media (Deutschbauer et al. 2002). There are several reasons why TRF4 might be important for germination. Trf4 is a member of the TRAMP complex, which degrades cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) (Butler 2002; Davis and Ares 2006; Wyers et al. 2005). The TRAMP complex also plays a role in degrading antisense transcripts (Camblong et al. 2007), in stimulating the degradation of spliced out introns, and in telomere maintenance (San Paolo et al. 2009). Additionally, the TRAMP complex has been shown to play a role in regulating histone levels (Reis and Campbell 2007). Thus, a trf4\xce\x94 mutation might indirectly impair germination by alterations in gene expression, including an alteration in histone levels. The role of Erg6 in maintaining proper cell membrane composition could be responsible for the germination defects seen in erg6\xe2\x88\x86 mutants. In the absence of Erg6, which catalyzes a step in ergosterol biosynthesis, cells produce zymosterol instead of ergosterol, changing the composition of the cell membrane (Bard et al. 1977). These changes result in changes in membrane fluidity and could result in changes in lipid rafts, which are important for cell signaling (Gaber et al. 1989; Sharma 2006; Valachovic et al. 2006). Changes in cell signaling could play an important role in spore germination leading to the delayed germination seen in erg6\xe2\x88\x86 mutants. We were unable to test whether the addition of exogenous ergosterol is capable of rescuing the observed defect, as S. cerevisiae is unable to take up ergosterol under aerobic conditions (Lewis et al. 1985). One intriguing result is that the germination defects for both trf4\xce\x94 and erg6\xce\x94 are more pronounced on solid than liquid media. Cells, and specifically spores, have been previously observed to behave differently on solid vs. liquid media (Piccirillo et al. 2010). Differences on solid media vs. liquid media is also the most probable reason that our screen failed to identify previously identified germination mutants as our screen was conducted on solid media while previous screens were conducted in liquid media (Deutschbauer et al. 2002; Herman and Rine 1997). Taken together, the results described here present evidence for two genes, TRF4 and ERG6, with roles in germination.

Potts']","July 11, 2011.",Genetic Variation in the Chemical Components of Eucalyptus globulus Wood,"b'Despite the ecological and economic importance of lignin and other wood chemical components, there are few studies of the natural genetic variation that exists within plant species and its adaptive significance. We used models developed from near infra-red spectroscopy to study natural genetic variation in lignin content and monomer composition (syringyl-to-guaiacyl ratio [S/G]) as well as cellulose and extractives content, using a 16-year-old field trial of an Australian tree species, Eucalyptus globulus. We sampled 2163 progenies of 467 native trees from throughout the native geographic range of the species. The narrow-sense heritability of wood chemical traits (0.25\xe2\x80\x930.44) was higher than that of growth (0.15), but less than wood density (0.51). All wood chemical traits exhibited significant broad-scale genetic differentiation (QST = 0.34\xe2\x80\x930.43) across the species range. This differentiation exceeded that detected with putatively neutral microsatellite markers (FST = 0.09), arguing that diversifying selection has shaped population differentiation in wood chemistry. There were significant genetic correlations among these wood chemical traits at the population and additive genetic levels. However, population differentiation in the S/G ratio of lignin in particular was positively correlated with latitude (R2 = 76%), which may be driven by either adaptation to climate or associated biotic factors.Forests occupy 30% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s terrestrial surface (FAO 2007) and are key terrestrial carbon stores, much of which is from wood (Sedjo 1993). Wood derived from natural and planted forests is also the basis of renewable energy and industrial production systems for products such as timber and pulp, worth more than $327 billion US in annual trade (FAO 2007). Wood is the fibrous material in the trunk of trees under the bark, which is composed of a complex mix of plant polymers. The most important quantitatively is cellulose, followed by lignin, hemicelluloses, and then extractives (Walker 2006). Cellulose fibers are deposited on cell walls along with lignin during the process of wood formation as cells expand following differentiation at the cambium (Walker 2006). Cellulose gives strength to the cell walls (Turner and Somerville 1997). Lignin supports the cellulose fibers, provides the hydrophobic surfaces in vessels essential for water conduction (Plomion et al. 2001), and also has roles in defense against wood eaters and pathogens (Coleman et al. 2008; Salmore and Hunter 2001). The evolution of lignin biosynthesis has been fundamental to the adaptation to the terrestrial environment (Weng and Chapple 2010), and the proportion of lignin in wood varies markedly between species (15%\xe2\x80\x9336%) (Zobel and Van Buijtenen 1989). Lignin is constructed of three monolignol monomers, hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S), with the proportion and location of the different monomers varying between and within species (Anterola and Lewis 2002). These monomers are synthesized in the cytoplasm, but lignin is formed when they are polymerized at the site of deposition (Lewis and Yamamoto 1990). The presence of methoxyl groups attached to the benzene ring of the lignin monomer increases the reactivity of the lignin to natural or artificial delignification agents (Pinto et al. 2002). As S has two methoxyl groups attached to the benzene ring, it has higher reactivity than G, which has only one methoxyl group. H is the least reactive having no methoxyl groups. Gymnosperm lignin is almost entirely composed of G with only a minor proportion of H and S (Alves et al. 2006; Campbell and Sederoff 1996; Godoy et al. 2007; Walker 2006), while woody angiosperms have H in trace amounts (Rencoret et al. 2008). In woody angiosperms, the ratio of S to G monomers (S/G) varies between species, provenance, and also between cell type within a tree (Pinto et al. 2002; Rodrigues et al. 1999; Rodrigues et al. 2001). Wood also contains extractives, a diverse group of nonstructural compounds that are mainly involved in chemical and physical defenses of living and dead wood (Boddy 2001). Extractives are present in sapwood, but preferentially deposited in the heartwood (Taylor et al. 2002). Resin acids predominate in the extractives of conifer heartwood, whereas a wide range of compounds occur in angiosperms, although in any one species the range is reduced (Gutierrez et al. 1999). Planted forests comprise an increasing proportion of the world\xe2\x80\x99s forests and now provide nearly half of the global wood production (FAO 2007). Short-rotation tree crops such as eucalypt plantations, are the feed stocks not only of the pulp and paper industry (Clarke 2009; Cotterill and Brolin 1997; Paues 1999), but are also seen as the basis of new industries replacing the use of fossil hydrocarbons for energy and industrial organic chemicals (Bozell 2010). In the case of pulp production, the strongest and highest quality pulp is produced by chemical delignification using powerful bases (the kraft process) leaving the cellulose fibers relatively undamaged for reconstitution as paper (Clarke 2009). Angiosperm wood with high S/G tends to be easier to delignify as per unit weight of dry wood it consumes less chemical and energy and produces higher pulp yield (Rencoret et al. 2007). Extractives may interfere with the efficiency of delignifying chemicals (Wallis et al. 1996) and also have adverse effects on the pulping process as they accumulate in industrial conduits which are costly to clean (Hillis and Sumimoto 1989). Breeding objectives for biomass crops intended for delignification could conceivably include reduced total lignin content or increased S/G (Bose et al. 2009). Conversely, other processes or products might require higher lignin content or lower S/G (Clarke 2009). Similarly, adaptation of the tree to abiotic or biotic environmental stresses may be impacted by changes in lignin content or composition, and processing objectives may or may not be aligned with requirements for plantations to be adapted to current or future environments. The extent to which breeders can directly or indirectly change wood chemical composition through selection will depend upon its quantitative genetic architecture, including the levels of additive genetic variation in the population, its heritability, and correlations between chemical components and other traits (Falconer and Mackay 1996). However, despite the economic and ecological importance of lignin and other wood chemicals, as well as decades of biotechnological research on specific genotypes (Coleman et al. 2008; Weng and Chapple 2010), the basic quantitative genetic architecture of these traits across the gene pool of any woody angiosperm species is poorly known. This has been mainly due to the high cost of measuring lignin, which has prevented the acquisition of the large sample sizes required to obtain robust and accurate genetic parameter estimates (Falconer and Mackay 1996). Quantification of wood chemical constituents is notoriously difficult, and the different methods used all have limitations (Anterola and Lewis 2002; Hatfield and Fukushima 2005). However, rapid and inexpensive near-infrared (NIR) reflectance chemometric methods have been developed that allow the prediction of chemical composition from NIR spectra (Schimleck et al. 2000; Workman 1992). NIR has been applied to large-scale studies of conifer species to estimate genetic parameters for lignin content and quality (Da Silva Perez et al. 2007), but has not been applied in large-scale studies of the genetic architecture of woody angiosperms. In this study, a large base population trial of open-pollinated Eucalyptus globulus was used to study the quantitative genetic architecture of wood chemical components (lignin, S/G, extractives, and cellulose) and their genetic correlation with traits under artificial selection (growth, wood density, and pulp yield; Stackpole et al. 2010b). Having studied the geographic variation in the wood chemicals across the geographic range of the species, we provide evidence that there is a signature of natural selection acting on these traits and discuss the potential drivers of genetic divergence.'","b'Despite the ecological and economic importance of lignin and other wood chemical components, there are few studies of the natural genetic variation that exists within plant species and its adaptive significance.

Having studied the geographic variation in the wood chemicals across the geographic range of the species, we provide evidence that there is a signature of natural selection acting on these traits and discuss the potential drivers of genetic divergence. Eucalyptus globulus Labill. (tasmanian blue gum sensu Brooker (2000), otherwise known as E. globulus ssp. globulus, Kirkpatrick,) is the main hardwood species grown in temperate Mediterranean climates across the globe (Potts et al. 2004). In its native range in south eastern Australia (Figure 1), it is often a dominant of coastal forests that typically grows 15 to 60 m tall (Williams and Potts 1996). The species is genetically diverse with geographic races showing broad-scale differences in numerous quantitative traits (Dutkowski and Potts 1999), many of which are presumably adaptive (e.g., frost tolerance; Tibbits et al. 2006; drought tolerance, Dutkowski 1995; Toro et al. 1998). Microsatellite analysis shows that contiguous races are more similar to one another than distant ones (Steane et al. 2006). E. globulus has a mixed mating system, and its open-pollinated seed contains between 65%\xe2\x80\x9389% outcrossed progenies in different populations (Mimura et al. 2009). In addition, biparental inbreeding affects between 4% and 11% of the progenies (Mimura et al. 2009). All Eucalyptus species, including E. globulus, are believed to have the same chromosome number (2n = 22) (Oudjehih and Bentouati 2006). Geographic distribution of subrace means for syringyl/guaiacyl ratio (S/G), Klason lignin, extractives and cellulose content in Eucalyptus globulus grown in a common environment field trial. The larger the circle or triangle, the more the subrace mean deviates above or below the mid range value. Subrace codes are as follows: TP - Tasman Peninsula; SET - South-eastern Tasmania; INET - Inland North-eastern Tasmania; ST - Southern Tasmania; SF - Southern Furneaux; StH - St Helens; FI - Flinders Island; KI - King Island; GF - Gippsland Foothills; NET - North-eastern Tasmania; StF - Strzelecki Foothills; WOt -Western Otways; CP - Cape Patton; EOt - Eastern Otways; FWOt - Far West Otways; StrR - Strzelecki Ranges; GCP - Gippsland Coastal Plain. The study was based on a Gunns Ltd family trial of E. globulus planted in 1989 at Latrobe in northern Tasmania (41\xc2\xb0 16\xe2\x80\x99 S, 146\xc2\xb0 27\xe2\x80\x99 E). The 570 families used in the trial were from single-tree, open-pollinated seed lots collected from a range-wide base population sampling of E. globulus. These families have been assigned to a geographic hierarchy of races, subraces and localities by Dutkowski and Potts (1999). This study focused on variation at the subrace and family levels, consistent with previous studies of this trial (Stackpole et al. 2010a,b). The trial design was a resolvable incomplete block design (Patterson and Williams 1976). The trial had five replicates, each divided into 24 incomplete blocks, each of which contained 24 families planted in two-tree plots. The trees that were alive in the trial at age 16 years were measured for diameter at breast height over bark at 1.3 m above ground level (DBH). Of these, a sample of 2163 trees was selected for wood property sampling, omitting four minor subraces (Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s Promontory Lighthouse, Mount Dromedary, Recherche Bay and Western Tasmania) (see Dutkowski and Potts 1999). Four or five individual trees were sampled from each of the 467 families that had four or more suitable candidate trees (alive and more than 10.0 cm in DBH) in the trial. In 452 families, one tree per replicate was sampled while in 12 families only two to three replicates were sampled. The number of families per subrace averaged 27, and ranged from 3 to 107 (see supporting information). Further sampling details are given in Stackpole et al. (2010a,b). Cambium to cambium wood cores were removed at 1.1 m above ground level. Each core was cut in half longitudinally and one half used to measure wood density (see Stackpole et al. 2010a) and the other half air-dried for predicting wood chemical composition (see Stackpole et al. 2010b). We used NIR spectroscopy to estimate wood chemical components as this is the only practical method for measuring the large number of samples required for detailed quantitative genetic analyses. NIR is widely used in assaying wood chemical composition in trees (Tsuchikawa 2007), including eucalypts (Schimleck et al. 2000; Raymond and Schimleck 2002). The air-dried wood was ground to pass through a 1-mm screen, and NIR spectra collected using a Bruker Optics Co. MPA (see supporting information). NIR models detailed in the supporting information were used to obtain predictions of S/G (coefficient of determination, R2 = 58.3), Klason lignin (R2 = 66.3), and extractives (R2 = 78.2%) for the 2163 trees. Validation of predictions was undertaken using chemical assays from 45 samples independent from those used to develop the model (S/G R2 = 47.0%, Klason lignin R2 = 60.0%, and extractives R2 = 83.3%). Because of the low phenotypic R2 for S/G, the genetic correlations were calculated between the NIR predictions and the 180 samples measured directly using pyrolysis, and a very high correlation was found (ra = 0.99). This means that with the averaging which occurs across families, there is a marked increase in the reliability of the NIR predictions at the genetic level over that at the individual phenotypic level (see supporting information for a more detailed explanation). Cellulose content (validation R2 = 85.0%) and pulp yield (validation R2 = 82.0%) for the same trees was obtained in a similar manner (see Stackpole et al. 2010b). Depending upon trait, the number of individuals for which wood property data were available ranged from 2140 to 2163 due to missing values (Table 1). Following the approach described in Stackpole et al. (2010b), a mixed model was fitted to the data from all the races used in the study. Replicate was fitted as a fixed effect, incomplete block and family within-subrace terms fitted as random effects, and subrace fitted as a fixed effect except in the bivariate analyses used to estimate subrace and family correlations. Univariate and bivariate models were fitted with ASReml (Gilmour et al. 2001). The effect of the wood chemical traits on survival were tested through calculation of the genetic correlation between the wood chemical and the whole trial survival data (0 = dead, 1 = alive) at age 16 years following the approach of Chambers et al. (1996). In addition to the analyses and tests described in Stackpole et al. (2010a,b), quantitative genetic divergence between subraces was also assessed using QST; which was calculated following Latta (1998) and Yang et al. (1996) as:where \xcf\x832subrace is the restricted maximum likelihood estimate of the between subrace variance component, and \xcf\x832add(subrace) is the estimate of the pooled within-subrace additive genetic variance. \xcf\x832add(subrace) was calculated from the family within subrace variance component, \xcf\x832family(subrace) (Stackpole et al. 2010b) using a coefficient of relatedness (r) of 0.4 for the open-pollinated families. Narrow-sense heritabilities (h2op), the coefficient of additive genetic variance (CVa), the coefficient of subrace genetic variance (CVs), subrace genetic correlations, and additive within subrace genetic correlations were calculated as detailed in Stackpole et al. (2010b). It should be noted that we expect that the genetic parameters for the chemical traits are likely to be underestimated as the error of NIR prediction is essentially included in the error variance and this would decrease heritability. The standard errors of QST and h2op were calculated with ASReml using an expanded Taylor series (Gilmour et al. 2001). For each trait a one-tailed likelihood ratio test was used to test whether QST was greater than the FST derived from putatively neutral microsatellite markers. QST is the quantitative genetic equivalent to the molecular measure of population divergence FST. If FST is measured using selectively neutral markers, then FST is the measure of the genetic differentiation among populations due to random drift or mutation (Latta 1998). If QST is significantly higher than FST, then this is evidence for diversifying natural selection acting on the quantitative trait (Latta 1998; Steane et al. 2006). The FST estimates used for this comparison were based on the average racial divergence in eight microsatellite loci as published by Steane et al. (2006) (FST = 0.09). We also tested against the highest FST reported for a single microsatellite locus in this species (FST = 0.158; Astorga et al. 2004) and obtained identical results but at the 0.05 level of significance. Correlations were derived from bivariate analyses as the multivariate models with more than two traits did not converge. The difference of the subrace and additive genetic correlations from zero was tested using two-tailed log likelihood tests. The subrace means of each trait were regressed against their latitude of origin. Locality means of extractives and Klason lignin content were also regressed against wood decay reported in Poke et al. (2006) and Hamilton et al. (2007) which were in common with the present study. Highly significant (P < 0.001) levels of additive genetic variation were evident within subraces for all traits assessed (LRT of \xcf\x832family(subrace); Table 1). Diameter had the lowest h2op (0.15 \xc2\xb1 0.03) and density the highest (0.51 \xc2\xb1 0.06), with the wood chemical traits all intermediate. The h2op of the four wood chemical traits (S/G, Klason lignin, extractives and cellulose) ranged from 0.25 to 0.44, and averaged 0.34. S/G had the highest estimate (0.44 \xc2\xb1 0.06) among these wood chemical traits. Despite their relatively high heritabilities, the coefficient of additive genetic variation within subraces (CVa) for the chemical and physical wood property traits were low when compared with diameter, except for extractives (Table 1). While the h2op of pulp yield was intermediate, it had the lowest CVa of all traits assessed. Within subraces, there were strong additive genetic correlations among the wood chemical traits. Genetic variation in Klason lignin was negatively correlated with cellulose (ra = \xe2\x88\x920.90 \xc2\xb1 0.04) (Table 2), weakly negatively correlated with S/G (ra = \xe2\x88\x920.31 \xc2\xb1 0.11), and positively correlated with extractives (ra = 0.62 \xc2\xb1 0.10). The S/G was negatively genetically correlated with extractives (ra = \xe2\x88\x920.59 \xc2\xb1 0.10). The additive genetic correlations of chemical traits with growth were statistically significant (P < 0.05) but were generally low. Faster growing trees (larger diameter) had less lignin (ra = \xe2\x88\x920.38 \xc2\xb1 0.15), higher S/G (ra = 0.33 \xc2\xb1 0.124), and higher cellulose (ra = 0.45 \xc2\xb1 0.12) than slower growing trees. No significant correlation between survival and wood chemical traits was detected at either the additive genetic or subrace levels (data not shown). Additive genetic variation in density was weakly negatively correlated with that of Klason lignin (ra = \xe2\x88\x920.23 \xc2\xb1 0.11) and S/G (ra = \xe2\x88\x920.28 \xc2\xb1 0.09). Pulp yield was strongly positively correlated with cellulose (ra = 0.91 \xc2\xb1 0.02) and strongly negatively correlated with Klason lignin (ra = \xe2\x88\x920.92 \xc2\xb1 0.04). Higher pulp yield was moderately associated with higher S/G (ra = 0.47 \xc2\xb1 0.08), faster growth (diameter, ra = 0.53 \xc2\xb1 0.12) and lower extractives (ra = \xe2\x88\x920.61 \xc2\xb1 0.09). In addition to the significant additive genetic variation within subraces, there were highly significant differences between the subraces of E. globulus for all wood chemical traits as well as density, diameter, and pulp yield (Table 1). The level of differentiation between subraces for diameter was significant but low, consistent with its low heritability. The coefficient of subrace variation (CVs) ranged from 2.05 for pulp yield to an atypical high of 13.7 for extractives. When viewed relative to the additive genetic variation within populations (as measured by either QST or CVs/CVa), the level of genetic variation between subraces for all wood chemical traits was markedly higher than that observed for diameter, and even density (Table 1). QST was significantly (P < 0.001) greater than the race level divergence in neutral molecular markers measured by FST for all the wood chemical traits (Table 1). At the subrace level, the patterns of variation in the four wood chemical traits (Klason lignin, S/G, extractives and cellulose) were not independent, with all rs estimates significant (P < 0.05) and most above |0.7| in magnitude (Table 2). The subrace differences in Klason lignin were negatively correlated with S/G (rs = \xe2\x88\x920.56 \xc2\xb1 0.11) and cellulose (rs = \xe2\x88\x920.98 \xc2\xb1 0.03) and positively correlated with extractives (rs = 0.90 \xc2\xb1 0.06). Of the wood chemical traits, S/G appeared to be the most genetically independent at the subrace and additive genetic level (Table 2). The subrace variation in S/G was negatively correlated with extractives (rs = \xe2\x88\x920.78 \xc2\xb1 0.11) and positively correlated with cellulose (rs = 0.73 \xc2\xb1 0.13). The subraces showed broad-scale geographic structure in the wood chemical traits (Figure 1); as for cellulose (Stackpole et al. 2010b). The main differentiation was between the mainland and Tasmanian subraces. The linear regression of subrace means on subrace latitude of origin was significant for S/G (R2 = 76%, P < 0.001), density (R2 = 49%, P < 0.01), cellulose (R2 = 30%, P < 0.05) and extractives (R2 = 28%, P < 0.05) (Table 1), consistent with latitudinal clines in these traits to varying degrees. The strongest latitudinal cline was with S/G, which tended to increase southward (Figure 1). The highest S/G values (2.10\xe2\x80\x932.07) occurred in southeastern Tasmania and the inland northeastern Tasmania, southern Tasmania, and Tasman Peninsula subraces and, excluding the last due to small number of families sampled, their subrace means were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than all other subraces (see supporting information). The lowest subrace means (range, 1.82\xe2\x80\x931.96) were from the mainland Victorian subraces from the Otways, Strzelecki Ranges, and Gippsland. Most subraces with intermediate S/G (1.99\xe2\x80\x932.02; Figure 1) were from the Bass Strait islands (King Island, Furneaux and South Furneaux). Notable deviations from this latitudinal cline were significant differences in S/G between geographically proximal subraces in Victoria (Strzelecki Foothills 1.93 vs. Strzelecki Ranges, 1.85; Gippsland Coastal Plain, 1.82) and Tasmania (inland northeastern Tasmania 2.08 vs. northeastern Tasmania 1.96). While extractives had a higher coefficient of variation between subraces (CVs) than S/G, only a small fraction of this variation could be explained by the latitudinal cline. Extractives content was highest in the Victorian and northeastern Tasmanian subraces (range, 4.9\xe2\x80\x935.6; except for Gippsland Foothills; seesupporting information) and lowest in subraces from the south of Tasmania (3.7\xe2\x80\x934.3; Figure 1c). King Island was also notable for its low extractives (3.9). Of particular note is the significantly high extractives content in the two coastal northeastern Tasmanian races (St. Helens, 5.6; inland northeastern Tasmania, 5.5) compared with all other eastern Tasmanian subraces (3.7\xe2\x80\x934.4) as well as the subraces immediately northward on the Furneaux Islands (Southern Furneaux, 4.2; Flinders Island, 4.4; see supporting information). Klason lignin showed no significant latitudinal trend over the full geographic range (Table 1; Figure 1), even though there was a weak subrace correlation with S/G (Table 2). As with extractives, Klason lignin increased northward along the continuous distribution of E. globulus on the eastern Tasmanian seaboard (Figure 1). While the magnitude of the differences was not large, the Klason lignin of the three northern Tasmanian subraces (St. Helens, 21.3, northeastern Tasmania, 20.8; inland northeastern Tasmania, 20.8) was significantly greater than that of the south-eastern Tasmania (20.2) and southern Tasmania (19.6) subraces (see supporting information). A key finding of our study is the significant genetic variation in wood chemical composition which occurs between the subraces of E. globulus. These subraces clearly differ in Klason lignin content. The pattern of variation observed was similar to that reported by Poke et al. (2006) from a different field site in Tasmania (Pearson correlation among the nine localities in common; r = 0.7, P < 0.05), indicating relatively stable genetic differences between localities across sites. There are few forest tree studies of genetic variation in lignin content and these focus on conifers (Schutt 1958 cited in Zobel and Jett 1995; Sewell et al. 2002; Wainhouse et al. 1998). In Picea sitchensis, bark lignin content displayed a latitudinal trend, thought to be associated with resistance to pests and pathogens (Wainhouse et al. 1998). Broad-scale provenance variation in lignin content has also been demonstrated in a large-scale study of the native American grass Panicum virgatum (Casler 2005; Casler et al. 2004). No significant latitudinal trend was detected for lignin content in the present study, but one was detected for S/G. There is some evidence that this clinal decrease in S/G with decreasing latitude within E. globulus may be part of a much broader continent-wide trend that transgresses multiple eucalypt species. First, while the wood specimens for each species were derived from different sites, Rencoret et al. (2008) reported that the S/G of E. globulus (at 2.6) was higher than that of species naturally distributed to its north, viz: E. maidenii (2.0), E. nitens (2.1), and particularly E. grandis (1.9). Second, del Rio et al. (2005) reported that the S/G of E. globulus (4.9) was higher than that of the closely related but more northerly distributed E. pseudoglobulus (3.7). Third, these trends are also evident across less-related species sampled from native forest from Tasmania to Papua New Guinea (Kawamura and Bland 1967). Despite these studies using different S/G analytical procedures that can give different results, E. globulus always had higher S/G than the species distributed to its north in a given study. There is continuous molecular and morphological variation from Tasmanian E. globulus to the closely related, northerly E. bicostata and E. pseudoglobulus, and the low S/G in the mainland subraces of E. globulus is potentially reflective of their intermediate status (Jones 2009). As with S/G, there is also the possibility that extractives content between eucalypt species increase northward across the climatic gradient between 40\xc2\xb0 S and 25\xc2\xb0 S. In E. globulus, for example, in a common environment trial it was shown that the extractives content of the wood from the closely related and more northerly distributed E. bicostata (5.7 \xc2\xb1 1.2) and E. maidenii (6.7 \xc2\xb1 1.0) was higher than that of E. globulus (3.7 \xc2\xb1 1.1) (Miranda and Pereira 2001), which again could reflect an extension of the intraspecific cline observed in extractives. There are two lines of evidence to indicate that the broad-scale pattern of genetic differentiation in the various wood components of E. globulus is a result of divergent natural selection across the geographic range of the species. First, the quantitative differentiation as measured by QST is significantly greater than that of the neutral marker FST for all wood chemical components, which suggests that subrace divergence has been driven by natural (diversifying) selection (Latta 1998). Second, the broad-scale trends discussed above for S/G and extractives, and the significant associations between latitude of subrace origin and S/G, shows that the genetic differentiation parallels a broad-scale climatic/environmental gradient (Aitken 2004). The observed genetic variation in wood chemical composition may be due to an evolutionary response to abiotic or biotic stresses acting singly or simultaneously (Roelofs et al. 2008). For instance, variation in lignin content is likely to be of adaptive importance (Gonzalez-Martinez et al. 2006), as it has primary roles in stem strength (Coleman et al. 2008), maintenance of water conduction (Gindl 2001; Plomion et al. 2001; Voelker 2009; Walker 2006), and possibly defense (Blanchette 1991; Campbell and Sederoff 1996; Del R\xc3\xado et al. 2002; Coleman et al. 2008; Salmore and Hunter 2001; Schwarze et al. 2000; Syafii et al. 1988; Wainhouse and Ashburner 1996), each of which are probably affected by spatially varying selection pressures. There is also evidence that variation in S/G may similarly be of adaptive significance (Anterola and Lewis 2002; Coleman et al. 2008; Walker 2006). For example, guaiacyl is preferentially deposited in the walls of vessels (Watanabe et al. 2004; Wu et al. 1992), an arrangement that may exploit its higher hydrophobicity compared with syringyl, and is thought to confer higher hydrostatic impermeability to the vessel wall (Walker 2006). Genetically modified Populus genotypes with a higher proportion of guaiacyl have demonstrated increased resistance to breaking of the water column in the vessels (embolism) following water stress (Anterola and Lewis 2002; Coleman et al. 2008). As with lignin, wood extractives are also thought to play a role in the tree defense against pathogens (Boddy 2001; Gierlinger et al. 2004; Taylor et al. 2002). To test for a geographic relationship between decay and wood chemical composition, published mean wood decay of E. globulus at the subrace level, available from Hamilton et al. (2007), and the locality means available from Poke et al. (2006) were regressed against lignin, extractives, and S/G in the present trial. The regressions were generally not significant; however, there was a single significant negative association (R2 = 65%; P < 0.05) between extractives levels from the present study and the locality level wood decay of Poke et al. (2006). This is a reasonable correlation for traits across two different trials conducted some years apart. However, as wood decay risk is likely to be higher in wetter climates, it will be challenging to unravel the roles of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the natural patterns of genetic variation in wood chemical composition (Armbruster and Schwaegerle 1996). In addition, identifying which traits are under selection is complicated by the fact that the chemical traits are genetically correlated with each other, as well as with wood density and growth (see also Poke et al. 2006). The pulpwood breeding objective for E. globulus aims to minimize the cost of pulp production per hectare by improving growth rate, density, and pulp yield (Greaves et al. 1997). While not currently considered breeding objectives, low total lignin and high S/G (Del Rio et al. 2005; Guerra et al. 2008; Macleod 2007; Pinto et al. 2002) are linked to more efficient chemical pulping, and these traits could be used as selection traits (Clarke 2009). Our study shows that there is significant additive genetic variation in these breeding objective and wood chemical traits, indicating their potential for genetic improvement through both between and within subrace selection. Within subraces, our additive genetic correlations indicate that selecting for increased growth will result in weak correlated genetic responses in wood chemistry, both increasing cellulose and S/G and decreasing lignin content. The positive additive genetic correlation observed between diameter and cellulose (ra = 0.45) was consistent with that of Apiolaza et al. (2005) (ra = 0.61 ns) and the average correlation of ra = 0.56 for five sites of E. nitens (Hamilton and Potts 2008), but was substantially different from the negative correlations (ra -0.16 to -0.43) previously reported by Raymond et al. (2001) in E. globulus. A previous small-scale study in E. globulus did not detect a significant additive genetic correlation between growth and lignin (Poke et al. 2006). However, the significant negative genetic correlation in our study (ra = \xe2\x88\x920.38) is informative given that two quantitative trait loci (QTL) for lignin have been shown to colocate with QTL for growth in hybrid eucalypts (Kirst et al. 2004). A higher rate of lignin production was associate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 with slower growth, possibly due to competition between the traits for carbon-based products. Our results suggest that the only correlated response expected from selection for increased wood density within E. globulus subraces is a tendency for lignin and S/G to decrease. A negative phenotypic correlation between S/G and wood density was found in E. globulus by da Seca and Domingues (2006), a result that occurred at the phenotypic, additive genetic, and subrace levels in the present study. No additive genetic relationship was observed between density and extractives, similar to previous studies that also did not find a genetic (Miranda and Pereira 2002; Poke et al. 2006) or phenotypic (Ona et al. 1998) correlation. The present study also indicated that selection for increased pulp yield would result in increased cellulose content and S/G but reduced lignin and extractives content and higher S/G. The high subrace and additive genetic correlations between pulp yield and cellulose content demonstrate that they are effectively the same trait (Stackpole et al. 2010b). This is consistent with QTL studies in E. globulus, where all QTL that were identified for pulp yield colocated with cellulose QTL, although not all cellulose QTL colocated with QTL for pulp yield (Freeman et al. 2009; Thamarus et al. 2004). A significant negative genetic correlation of pulp yield and cellulose with Klason lignin has been reported previously in E. globulus (Poke et al. 2006). A negative phenotypic correlation has also been reported between Klason lignin and cellulose content (Ona et al. 1998). Such a negative relationship is expected due to the physical complementarity of cellulose and lignin in wood structure (Plomion et al. 2001). In conclusion, our large-scale study has shown significant genetic variation in wood chemical composition at two-geographic scales within the native gene pool of E. globulus. There is evidence that this variation may be an adaptive response to either biotic or abiotic factors, although unraveling the nature of this selection will be challenging due to the strong correlation among traits and potential for correlation among the environmental selection agents across the geographic range of the species. Regardless of the cause of the patterns of genetic variation, the genetic correlations observed are generally favorable for a pulp wood breeding objective. This applies both among the chemical traits themselves as well as their correlation with the main breeding objective traits of growth, wood density and pulp yield. However, a future challenge will be to determine whether breeding objectives for adaptation to specific environments (e.g., drier or high disease risk areas) will be compatible with industrial objectives for the improvement of wood properties.

8,"['Sofia Sousa-Guimarães', 'Claudio Sunkel', 'Nicolas Malmanche']","July 11, 2011.",polo Is Identified as a Suppressor of bubR1 Nondisjunction in a Deficiency Screen of the Third Chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster,"b'We have previously characterized an EMS-induced allele of the bubR1 gene (bubR1D1326N) that separates the two functions of BubR1, causing meiotic nondisjunction but retaining spindle assembly checkpoint activity during somatic cell division in Drosophila melanogaster. Using this allele, we demonstrate that bubR1 meiotic nondisjunction is dosage sensitive, occurs for both exchange and nonexchange homologous chromosomes, and is associated with decreased maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion and of the synaptonemal complex during prophase I progression. We took advantage of these features to perform a genetic screen designed to identify third chromosome deficiencies having a dominant effect on bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1 meiotic phenotypes. We tested 65 deficiencies covering 60% of the third chromosome euchromatin. Among them, we characterized 24 deficiencies having a dominant effect on bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1 meiotic phenotypes that we classified in two groups: (1) suppressor of nondisjunction and (2) enhancer of nondisjunction. Among these 24 deficiencies, our results show that deficiencies uncovering the polo locus act as suppressor of bubR1 nondisjunction by delaying meiotic prophase I progression and restoring chiasmata formation as observed by the loading of the condensin subunit SMC2. Furthermore, we identified two deficiencies inducing a lethal phenotype during embryonic development and thus affecting BubR1 kinase activity in somatic cells and one deficiency causing female sterility. Overall, our genetic screening strategy proved to be highly sensitive for the identification of modifiers of BubR1 kinase activity in both meiosis and mitosis.Mitosis is a process that results in the production of two identical daughter cells from a single cell. At metaphase-anaphase transition, the accuracy of chromosome segregation is ensured by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) that monitors microtubule-kinetochore attachment and prevents mitotic exit until all chromosomes are attached to the bipolar spindle and under tension. The Mad (mitotic arrest deficient) and Bub (budding uninhibited by benomyl) SAC components were first identified in budding yeast through genetic screens designed to isolate mutations which override the mitotic arrest in the presence of microtubule depolymerizing drugs (Hoyt et al. 1991; Li and Murray 1991). Immunolocalization studies have shown that these conserved proteins localize to kinetochores that are unattached or under reduced tension (Chen et al. 1998; Taylor et al. 1998; Logarinho et al. 2004). The SAC proteins impose a mitotic arrest by inhibiting the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) that is essential for sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit (Li and Benezra 1996; Taylor and Mckeon 1997; Bernard et al. 1998; Gorbsky et al. 1998; Basu et al. 1999). However, the Bub1-related kinase (BubR1), which displays N-terminal homology with the yeast Mad3 protein and C-terminal homology with the Bub1 kinase domain, is found only in higher eukaryotes (Taylor et al. 1998). In addition to its involvement in the SAC, BubR1 is also required for proper mitotic timing, capture, and stabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachment at prometaphase-metaphase transition (Basu et al. 1999; Ditchfield et al. 2003; Logarinho et al. 2004; Harris et al. 2005; Lampson and Kapoor 2005) and for mitotic arrest in the presence of DNA damage (Fang et al. 2006). Furthermore, BubR1 is essential to prevent early aging and infertility in mice (Baker et al. 2006; Hartman et al. 2007; Matsumoto et al. 2007). In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in the production of haploid gametes from a diploid parental cell. Meiosis involves one single round of DNA replication followed by two sequential rounds of cell division (meiosis I and meiosis II). During meiotic prophase I, homologous chromosomes undergo a complex series of modifications through pairing, synapsis, and exchange to ensure chromosome reduction and sister chromatid separation during meiosis. Nondisjunction (NDJ), the failure to properly segregate the genome during meiosis, produces haploid cells that have unbalanced genetic composition. The vast majority of meiotic segregation errors occur during meiosis in females, and the error rate increases with advancing maternal age. The frequency of missegregation in human oocytes is remarkably high (about 10% of meiosis), and this is thought to be one reason for the high rate of miscarriages (spontaneous abortions) in early stages of pregnancy (Alberts et al. 2002). In contrast to mitosis, where BubR1 has an important role in controlling the metaphase-anaphase transition, it was shown that MAD3/BubR1 has an essential and conserved function during prophase I progression in meiosis. MAD3/BubR1 is required to delay prophase I in response to nonexchange chromosomes in budding yeast (Cheslock et al. 2005). In D. melanogaster, BubR1 was shown to play an essential role during meiotic progression in both sexes and to prevent missegregation of both chiasmate and achiasmate homologous chromosomes. During oogenesis, BubR1 is also required to maintain the synaptonemal complex (SC) (Malmanche et al. 2007). In mice, BubR1-depleted oocytes have a reduced capacity to trigger essential meiotic arrest through destabilization of the APC/C inhibitor Cdh1 (Homer et al. 2009). It was also shown that overexpression of exogenous BubR1 arrests oocyte maturation during meiosis I, while dominant-negative BubR1 expression accelerates meiotic progression (Wei et al. 2010). These studies indicate an essential requirement for BubR1 function in timing the complex events taking place during meiotic prophase I progression. In D. melanogaster, we have previously characterized a bubR1 EMS allele with a point mutation in a conserved amino acid essential for its kinase activity, bubR1D1326N (Malmanche et al. 2007). Using this allele, we showed that individuals with bubR1D1326N in trans with two previously characterized alleles, bubR11 (Basu et al. 1999) and bubR1rev1 (Perez-Mongiovi et al. 2005), and with Df(2R)nap9, a deficiency uncovering bubR1, lack any of the visible phenotypes that are characteristic of a defect in mitosis and have a functional SAC. However, during meiosis, bubR1D1326N trans-heterozygotes show meiotic NDJ for the autosome and sex chromosomes, with the frequency being BubR1 dosage-dependent. We took advantage of these sensitized genetic backgrounds (Malmanche et al. 2007) to perform a genetic screening to identify third chromosome deficiencies displaying suppression or enhancement of X NDJ frequency. For this, we used the third chromosome D. melanogaster deficiency kit from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center and we tested 60% of the third chromosome euchromatin. Our results identified 18 deficiencies that suppress and 6 deficiencies that enhance X NDJ. Among the candidate genes tested, we identified Polo kinase as a strong suppressor of the NDJ phenotype and demonstrate that this effect is related to the maintenance of SC during prophase I progression. We identified one deficiency that causes female sterility and two deficiencies affecting BubR1 kinase activity during embryonic development and somatic cell cycle progression, indicating that other pathways can complement BubR1 kinase activity in an otherwise wild-type genetic background.'","b'We have previously characterized an EMS-induced allele of the bubR1 gene (bubR1D1326N) that separates the two functions of BubR1, causing meiotic nondisjunction but retaining spindle assembly checkpoint activity during somatic cell division in Drosophila melanogaster. Using this allele, we demonstrate that bubR1 meiotic nondisjunction is dosage sensitive, occurs for both exchange and nonexchange homologous chromosomes, and is associated with decreased maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion and of the synaptonemal complex during prophase I progression. We took advantage of these features to perform a genetic screen designed to identify third chromosome deficiencies having a dominant effect on bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1 meiotic phenotypes. We tested 65 deficiencies covering 60% of the third chromosome euchromatin. Among them, we characterized 24 deficiencies having a dominant effect on bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1 meiotic phenotypes that we classified in two groups: (1) suppressor of nondisjunction and (2) enhancer of nondisjunction. Among these 24 deficiencies, our results show that deficiencies uncovering the polo locus act as suppressor of bubR1 nondisjunction by delaying meiotic prophase I progression and restoring chiasmata formation as observed by the loading of the condensin subunit SMC2. Furthermore, we identified two deficiencies inducing a lethal phenotype during embryonic development and thus affecting BubR1 kinase activity in somatic cells and one deficiency causing female sterility. Overall, our genetic screening strategy proved to be highly sensitive for the identification of modifiers of BubR1 kinase activity in both meiosis and mitosis. Mitosis is a process that results in the production of two identical daughter cells from a single cell. At metaphase-anaphase transition, the accuracy of chromosome segregation is ensured by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) that monitors microtubule-kinetochore attachment and prevents mitotic exit until all chromosomes are attached to the bipolar spindle and under tension. The Mad (mitotic arrest deficient) and Bub (budding uninhibited by benomyl) SAC components were first identified in budding yeast through genetic screens designed to isolate mutations which override the mitotic arrest in the presence of microtubule depolymerizing drugs (Hoyt et al. 1991; Li and Murray 1991). Immunolocalization studies have shown that these conserved proteins localize to kinetochores that are unattached or under reduced tension (Chen et al. 1998; Taylor et al. 1998; Logarinho et al. 2004). The SAC proteins impose a mitotic arrest by inhibiting the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) that is essential for sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit (Li and Benezra 1996; Taylor and Mckeon 1997; Bernard et al. 1998; Gorbsky et al. 1998; Basu et al. 1999). However, the Bub1-related kinase (BubR1), which displays N-terminal homology with the yeast Mad3 protein and C-terminal homology with the Bub1 kinase domain, is found only in higher eukaryotes (Taylor et al. 1998). In addition to its involvement in the SAC, BubR1 is also required for proper mitotic timing, capture, and stabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachment at prometaphase-metaphase transition (Basu et al. 1999; Ditchfield et al. 2003; Logarinho et al. 2004; Harris et al. 2005; Lampson and Kapoor 2005) and for mitotic arrest in the presence of DNA damage (Fang et al. 2006). Furthermore, BubR1 is essential to prevent early aging and infertility in mice (Baker et al. 2006; Hartman et al. 2007; Matsumoto et al. 2007). In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in the production of haploid gametes from a diploid parental cell. Meiosis involves one single round of DNA replication followed by two sequential rounds of cell division (meiosis I and meiosis II). During meiotic prophase I, homologous chromosomes undergo a complex series of modifications through pairing, synapsis, and exchange to ensure chromosome reduction and sister chromatid separation during meiosis. Nondisjunction (NDJ), the failure to properly segregate the genome during meiosis, produces haploid cells that have unbalanced genetic composition. The vast majority of meiotic segregation errors occur during meiosis in females, and the error rate increases with advancing maternal age. The frequency of missegregation in human oocytes is remarkably high (about 10% of meiosis), and this is thought to be one reason for the high rate of miscarriages (spontaneous abortions) in early stages of pregnancy (Alberts et al. 2002). In contrast to mitosis, where BubR1 has an important role in controlling the metaphase-anaphase transition, it was shown that MAD3/BubR1 has an essential and conserved function during prophase I progression in meiosis. MAD3/BubR1 is required to delay prophase I in response to nonexchange chromosomes in budding yeast (Cheslock et al. 2005). In D. melanogaster, BubR1 was shown to play an essential role during meiotic progression in both sexes and to prevent missegregation of both chiasmate and achiasmate homologous chromosomes. During oogenesis, BubR1 is also required to maintain the synaptonemal complex (SC) (Malmanche et al. 2007). In mice, BubR1-depleted oocytes have a reduced capacity to trigger essential meiotic arrest through destabilization of the APC/C inhibitor Cdh1 (Homer et al. 2009). It was also shown that overexpression of exogenous BubR1 arrests oocyte maturation during meiosis I, while dominant-negative BubR1 expression accelerates meiotic progression (Wei et al. 2010). These studies indicate an essential requirement for BubR1 function in timing the complex events taking place during meiotic prophase I progression. In D. melanogaster, we have previously characterized a bubR1 EMS allele with a point mutation in a conserved amino acid essential for its kinase activity, bubR1D1326N (Malmanche et al. 2007). Using this allele, we showed that individuals with bubR1D1326N in trans with two previously characterized alleles, bubR11 (Basu et al. 1999) and bubR1rev1 (Perez-Mongiovi et al. 2005), and with Df(2R)nap9, a deficiency uncovering bubR1, lack any of the visible phenotypes that are characteristic of a defect in mitosis and have a functional SAC. However, during meiosis, bubR1D1326N trans-heterozygotes show meiotic NDJ for the autosome and sex chromosomes, with the frequency being BubR1 dosage-dependent. We took advantage of these sensitized genetic backgrounds (Malmanche et al. 2007) to perform a genetic screening to identify third chromosome deficiencies displaying suppression or enhancement of X NDJ frequency. For this, we used the third chromosome D. melanogaster deficiency kit from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center and we tested 60% of the third chromosome euchromatin. Our results identified 18 deficiencies that suppress and 6 deficiencies that enhance X NDJ. Among the candidate genes tested, we identified Polo kinase as a strong suppressor of the NDJ phenotype and demonstrate that this effect is related to the maintenance of SC during prophase I progression. We identified one deficiency that causes female sterility and two deficiencies affecting BubR1 kinase activity during embryonic development and somatic cell cycle progression, indicating that other pathways can complement BubR1 kinase activity in an otherwise wild-type genetic background. The third chromosome deficiency kit, as well as some of the mutant alleles, were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. From the 96 deficiency stocks of the third chromosome, we were able to generate and maintain 65 deficiencies in the bubR1D1326N genetic background. To test their effect on female X NDJ, bubR1rev1/bubR1D1326N;Df/+ females were crossed to C(1;Y)1, v f B/O males, and the resulting X NDJ frequency was calculated from the progeny. From this cross, regular female progeny are Bar (X/C(1;Y)1, v f B) and regular male progeny are non-Bar (X/O), exceptional female progeny are non-Bar (XX/O) and exceptional male progeny are vermilion, forked, and Bar (C(1;Y)1, v f B/O). The X NDJ frequency was calculated using the following formula: X NDJ = (2 \xc3\x97 males and females exceptional progeny)/Adjusted total progeny, with the Adjusted total progeny = (2 \xc3\x97 males and females exceptional progeny) + normal progeny. The exceptional progeny was multiplied by 2 due to the lethality associated with half of the exceptional progeny (triplo-X and nullo-X). Ovaries were dissected in cold 1\xc3\x97 PBS. Fixation was performed for 20 min in 2% EM grade formaldehyde as described in Page and Hawley (2001), followed by 2 hr permeabilization in 1\xc3\x97 PBS - 0,5% Triton X-100\xe2\x80\x9310% calf serum. Primary antibodies used were: guinea pig anti-C(3)G (Page and Hawley 2001), rat anti-SMC1 (Malmanche et al. 2007), rabbit anti-SMC2 (Savvidou et al. 2005), mouse anti-Orb (Lantz et al. 1994). The following secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000: anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 and anti-guinea pig Alexa Fluor 647. DNA was detected in 1X PBS containing 1 \xc2\xb5g/ml of DAPI. Images were obtained using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS Confocal Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg), deconvolved using Huygens Essential (version 3.0.2pl) and processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Wild-type and bubR1 mutant embryos were collected and aged at 25\xc2\xb0C. Immunodetection on embryos was performed as described in Sullivan et al. (2000). Primary antibody used was: anti-phospho H3 rabbit polyclonal, used at 1:500 (Upstate Biotechnology). Secondary antibody used was: anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 used at 1:2000 (Molecular Probes). DNA was detected in 1\xc3\x97 PBS containing 1 \xc2\xb5g/ml of DAPI. For colchicine treatment, embryos were permeabilized in n-heptane, containing 250 \xc2\xb5M colchicine in 1\xc3\x97 PBS for 30 min before fixation. Images were obtained using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS Confocal Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg), deconvolved using Huygens Essential (version 3.0.2pl) and processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0. To determine whether a specific third chromosome deficiency has an effect on bubR1 X NDJ, first we analyzed the overall variations observed in the control genotype, X/X;bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1. During the screening procedure, we performed 16 rounds of X NDJ experiments, using for each group a control with the X/X;bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1 genotype. Within these 16 controls, the X NDJ frequency ranges from 16.60% to 35.20%, allowing us to calculate an average frequency of 25.82% with a standard deviation of 4.87% (Table 1). These results indicate an inherent variability in the experimental procedure that reflects uncontrollable environmental effects, as well as sampling errors. Thus, in a first approach, we consider that a given third chromosome deficiency has an effect on bubR1 X NDJ if the frequency is below 20.95% or above 30.69% of the control values, and if the given deficiency shows the same effect when compared to the control for its specific experimental round. For that, we performed a statistical analysis using the multinomial-Poisson hierarchy model (Zeng et al. 2010) to take into account variations in sample size and sampling errors. Using these parameters, we identified 24 deficiencies that affect bubR1 X NDJ with a 95% of confidence interval. The third chromosome deficiency kit that we originally used included 96 deficiencies. From these, we were able to generate 65 stocks in the appropriate bubR1D1326N genetic background that covers 60% of the third chromosome euchromatin. As stated above, we performed 16 rounds of experiments to screen these 65 deficiencies (Table 2 and supporting information, Table S1). Using the appropriate parameters for comparison with controls (see above), we identified 6 deficiencies that enhance and 18 deficiencies that suppress the bubR1 X NDJ. We also identified one deficiency (Df(3L)ED4674) causing sterility in bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1 females and two deficiencies (Df(3L)BSC10 and Df(3R)BSC56) inducing a zygotic developmental arrest. Following the first round of screening, we performed a second round of genetic screens using overlapping deficiencies and mutant alleles of candidate genes for three deficiencies that enhance and two that suppress bubR1 X NDJ, for the deficiency that causes female sterility, and for the two deficiencies that induce an embryonic lethal phenotype. We also performed complementation tests using a number of overlapping deficiencies for the remaining enhancers and suppressors to confirm the breakpoints of the deficiencies in the stocks we established and used to test bubR1 X NDJ (Table S2). In the group of deficiencies that enhance the frequency of bubR1 X NDJ, we narrowed down to a smaller genomic region or identified candidate genes for the following deficiencies: Df(3R)D605 (97E2;98A3-4), Df(3L)Pc-2q (78C5-6;78E3-79A1), and Df(3L)BSC13 (66B12-C1;66D2-4). Because the breakpoints of some of these deficiencies have not been defined molecularly, it is likely that these regions and the genes they contain cannot be accurately defined. Df(3R)D605 (97E2;98A3-4) enhances bubR1 X NDJ by 17.19% when compared with its own matched control (Table 2). To identify a smaller genomic region, we tested four overlapping deficiencies [Df(3R)ED6255 (97D2;97F1); Df(3R)Exel6206 (97E1;97E5); Df(3R)ED6237 (97E4;97E11) and Df(3R)IR16 (97F1-2;98A)] and one deficiency covering completely Df(3R)D605 [Df(3R)ED6265 (97E2;98A7)]. Among these five deficiencies, only Df(3R)ED6265 has a similar effect as Df(3R)D605 on bubR1 X NDJ, indicating that the gene responsible for the observed enhancement lies within 98A1;98A4 genomic region (Table S3). Df(3L)Pc-2q (78C5-6;78E3-79A1) enhances bubR1 X NDJ by 18.43% when compared to its own matched control (Table 2). Within the third chromosome deficiency kit, we also tested Df(3L)ED4978 (78D5;79A2) which partially overlaps with Df(3L)Pc-2q. However, Df(3L)ED4978 suppresses bubR1 X NDJ by 6.52% when compared to its own matched control (Table 2). Thus, according to the cytogenetic map coordinates for both deficiencies, we can conclude that the enhancer gene is located in the genomic region 78C5-6;78D4, while the suppressor gene is located in the genomic region 79A1;79A2. Df(3L)BSC13 (66B12-C1;66D2-4) enhances bubR1 X NDJ by 18.24% when compared with its own matched control (Table 2). Within the third chromosome deficiency kit, we also tested Df(3L)ZP1 (66A17-20;66C1-5), which partially overlaps with Df(3L)BSC13. However, Df(3L)ZP1 suppresses bubR1 X NDJ (Table 2), suggesting that the enhancer gene should be in the region 66C6-66D4. Within this region, we identified matrimony (mtrm \xe2\x80\x93 66C11) as a candidate gene. mtrm was previously identified in a screen of the major autosomes as being haploinsufficient for achiasmate segregation in Drosophila oocytes (Harris et al. 2003). We tested a null allele of mtrm, mtrm126 (Xiang et al. 2007) in a bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1 mutant female background and observed a 13.40% increase of bubR1 X NDJ. However, mtrm126/+ females have a frequency of X NDJ of 9.45%. Thus, it is likely that the enhancement of bubR1 X NDJ observed in bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1; mtrm126/+ females is only due to an additive effect of the frequency of NDJ displayed by mtrm and bubR1 mutants alone. In the group of deficiencies that suppress the frequency of bubR1 X NDJ, we narrowed down to a smaller genomic region or identified candidate genes for the following deficiencies: Df(3R)ED5559 (86E11;87B11) and Df(3L)rdgC-co2 (77A1;77D1). Df(3R)ED5559 (86E11;87B11) completely suppresses bubR1-induced X NDJ (Table 2). To uncover the gene responsible for the full phenotypic rescue, we tested four deficiencies that overlap Df(3R)ED5559 [Df(3R)ED5516 (86D8;86E13); Df(3R)Exel8154 (86E13;86E18); Df(3R)Exel7310 (86E18;87A1) and Df(3R)ED5577 (86F9;87B13)]. Our results show that only Df(3R)ED5577 has a similar effect, suggesting that the candidate gene is within the genomic region 87A2;87B11. In this region, we identified aurora (aur) as a potential candidate gene. Aur is essential for several aspects of the cell cycle and mitotic progression (Berdnik and Knoblich 2002; Marumoto et al. 2003; Portier et al. 2007). We tested two EMS aur alleles, aur1 (hypomorphic allele) and aur87Ac-3 (null allele) (Glover et al. 1995). However, none of these alleles showed a full rescue of bubR1 X NDJ, suggesting that a different gene within the region is responsible for this effect (Table S3). Df(3L)rdgC-co2 (77A1;77D1) suppresses bubR1 X NDJ by 14.68% when compared with its own matched control (Table 2). We identified two other overlapping deficiencies that also suppress bubR1 X NDJ: Df(3L)ED4858 (76D3;77C1) and Df(3L)Exel6136 (77B2;77C6), suggesting that the gene responsible is within the genomic region 77B2;77C1 (Table 3). In this genomic region, we identified polo (77B2-77B3) as a candidate gene, so we tested three polo mutant alleles (polo1, polo2, and polo9). Our results show that all three alleles suppress bubR1 X NDJ and the level of suppression increases with stronger polo alleles (Table 3). polo1 is a weak hypomorph allele with an EMS-induced point mutation in the kinase domain and is hemizygous viable (Sunkel and Glover 1988). polo9 allele has a P-element insertion that reduces Polo levels, and is homozygous lethal at third-instar larvae (Donaldson et al. 2001). polo2 was induced by P-M hybrid dysgenesis and is consider as the strongest polo allele (C.E. Sunkel, R.E. Karess, and D.M. Glover, unpublished results). During meiosis, CDC5, the yeast polo homolog, is required to phosphorylate and remove meiotic cohesin from chromosome arms (Lee and Amon 2003), to form chiasmata (Clyne et al. 2003), to co-orient sister kinetochores and to cosegregate sister centromeres at meiosis I (Clyne et al. 2003; Lee and Amon 2003). In D. melanogaster meiosis, Polo is involved in the timing of meiotic prophase I entry, in the restriction of meiosis to the oocyte and in the initiation/maintenance of SC (Mirouse et al. 2006). At later stage, Polo is required to activate Twine, a germline-specific form of the Cdc25 phosphatase, that initiates the chain of events leading to GVBD and prometaphase I progression (Xiang et al. 2007). At meiosis II, Polo is essential to phosphorylate and remove MEI-S332, the Shugoshin homolog, and to allow sister chromatid segregation (Clarke et al. 2005). To further investigate at the molecular level the nature of the decrease in X NDJ, we first analyzed whether reducing Polo dosage in bubR1 mutant females restores in part, the meiotic prophase I phenotypes associated with the bubR1 mutation. Because BubR1 and Polo appear to have opposite effects during early stages of meiotic prophase I, with Polo controlling meiotic entry and SC assembly and BubR1 controlling meiotic prophase I progression and SC disassembly, we analyzed the nature of the SC and sister chromatid cohesion in bubR1D1326N/Df(2R)nap9;polo9/+ mutant combinations in region 3 of the germarium (Figure 1). Interestingly, while mutations in bubR1 result in premature disassembly of the SC, in the bubR1D1326N/Df(2R)nap9;polo9/+ we observed the maintenance of the SC protein, C(3)G, and the sister chromatid cohesin subunit, SMC1 (Figure 1, A and B). This suggests that decreasing Polo dosage in bubR1 mutant ovarioles delays sufficiently prophase I entry and/or progression to allow a more accurate prophase I. In addition, we investigated if a reduction of Polo dosage in bubR1 mutant females allows a higher efficiency in the specific replacement of cohesin complex by condensin complex during chiasmata formation (Yu and Koshland 2005) and SC disassembly (Ivanovska et al. 2005; Resnick et al. 2009). Thus, we analyzed the localization of SMC2 condensin subunit at stage 5-7, which corresponds to the pachytene-diplotene transition. In wild-type oocytes, condensin subunit SMC2 is gradually loaded on the bivalent to fully cover the karyosome by stage 5-7 (Figure 1C). However, in bubR1 mutant oocytes, SMC2 localizes within the nuclear space rather than being bound to the karyosome (Figure 1C). Thus, in addition to the decrease in the maintenance of the SC and of the sister chromatid cohesion, mutations in bubR1 also affect the changes in bivalent configuration at diplotene. Interestingly, decreasing Polo dosage restores condensin loading and bivalent modifications in bubR1 mutant oocytes. Taken together, these results suggest that the decreased X NDJ induced by a reduction of Polo dosage in bubR1 mutant oocytes occurs through a Polo-dependent mechanism during the initial stages of meiosis. Polo is a suppressor of bubR1 X NDJ. (A) Structure of SC in wild-type, in bubR1 mutant and in bubR1;polo mutant in region 3 of the germarium. C(3)G is in green, DNA is in blue, and Orb (as oocyte marker) is in red. Decreasing polo dosage in a bubR1 genetic background rescues the maintenance of the SC in the oocyte nucleus comparing to bubR1 mutant.

Scale bars = 10 \xce\xbcm. Df(3L)ED4674 (73B5;73E5) causes sterility in bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1 mutant females, suggesting a strong enhancement of the bubR1 meiotic phenotype. To narrow down the genomic region of interest, we tested four overlapping deficiencies [Df(3L)BSC561 (73A2;73C1); Df(3L)Exel9004 (73D1;73D5); Df(3L)Exel7253 (73D5;73E4) and Df(3L)BSC414 (73E1;74C3)]. Among these four deficiencies, our results show that only Df(3L)BSC561 causes sterility in bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1 mutant females, indicating the presence of a dosage-sensitive gene within the genomic region 73B5-73C1. Within this region, we found two potential candidate genes, Baldspot and Lasp, which have an essential function during spermatogenesis (Jung et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2008). It was previously shown that different domains of BubR1 have different functions, with the KEN box being essential for SAC activity but the kinase domain being required only for spindle formation during prometaphase (Elowe et al. 2010). Mutations in BubR1 kinase domain give rise to viable adults lacking any visible phenotype, and mutant cells are able to properly segregate their genetic material during somatic cell division (Malmanche et al. 2007; Rahmani et al. 2009). Interestingly, we identified two deficiencies that induce an embryonic lethality in the bubR1 genetic background indicating that a decrease in some components of the cell cycle network can impair cell cycle progression and zygote development in a BubR1 kinase dead context. Df(3L)BSC10 deletes the genomic region 69D4-5;69F5-7. First, we characterized the embryonic stage at which the development of bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1;Df(3L)BSC10/+ embryos fail to proceed. For this, we analyzed staged embryonic collections from 0-2 hr that were aged for 3 hr before fixation. Our results showed a developmental arrest at stage 5 that corresponds to the point when the syncytial cell cycle 13 ends and cellularization and gastrulation initiates (Figure 2A). Thus, we asked if the mutant embryos failed to undergo gastrulation due to a modified cytoskeleton network. For this, embryos were collected as before, but they were treated with colchicine prior to fixation, to depolymerize microtubules. In wild-type embryos, colchicine treatment does not affect the overall nuclear structure, and the replicated chromosomes remain decondensed (Figure 2B). However, in the mutant embryos, we observed the condensation of interphase chromatin after colchicine treatment. Moreover, chromosome condensation is associated with the presence of the phospho-H3 epitope that is normally only detected in dividing nuclei (Figure 2B). To identify candidate genes within this deficiency, we tested overlapping deficiencies covering the Df(3L)BSC10 deleted region [Df(3L)iro-2 (69B1-5;69D1-6); Df(3L)Exel6117 (69D1;69E2), Df(3L)E44 (69D2;69E3-5) and Df(3L)ED4486 (69C4;69F6)]. However, none of the deficiencies tested induce an embryonic lethal phenotype, suggesting that the candidate gene is within the genomic region 69F6;69F7. Within this small region, we found RpS4 (Ribosomal protein S4), a gene involved in mitotic spindle elongation and organization (Goshima et al. 2007). However, we cannot exclude the possibility of Df(3L)BSC10 having another unknown chromosomal aberration. BubR1 kinase activity is essential during somatic cell cycle (A) The developmental arrest induced by Df(3L)BSC10 in BubR1 kinase dead embryos takes place after the syncitial division and prevents the initialization of gastrulation. (B) Embryonic phenotype at stage 5 after 250 \xce\xbcM colchicine treatment in wild-type and progeny from a cross made between bubR1rev1/TSTL females to bubR1D1326N/CyO;Df(3L)BSC10/TM3 males. Phospho-Histone 3 is in red and DAPI is in green. In contrast to wild-type embryos, replicated chromosomes in mutant embryos after colchicine treatment appear condensed and the presence of phospho-histone 3 epitope is detected. Scale bars = 10\xce\xbcm. Df(3R)BSC56 (94E1-2;94F1-2) also induces a developmental arrest of bubR1D1326N/bubR1rev1;Df(3R)BSC56/+ mutant embryos. We used five overlapping deficiencies covering the Df(3R)BSC56 deleted region to identify candidate genes [Df(3R)BSC55 (94D2-10;94E1-6), Df(3R)Exel6193 (94D3;94E4), Df(3R)ED6103 (94D3;94E9), Df(3R)Exel6274 (94E4;94E11) and Df(3R)Exel6194 (94F1;95A4)]. Among these deficiencies, only Df(3R)Exel6274 induces an embryonic lethality, suggesting the presence of the candidate gene within the genomic region 94E9;94E11, defined between the breakpoint of Df(3R)ED6103 and Df(3R)Exel6274. Within this region, we identified cdc16 (94E9) as a potential candidate gene. Cdc16/Apc6 is a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) subunit of APC/C, essential for G2 progression. cdc16RNAi animals die as P5(i) early pupae and cdc16RNAi cells show mitotic phenotypes, including high mitotic index and overcondensed chromosomes in a metaphase-like arrest and depletion of Cdc16 also affects cyclin B degradation (Pal et al. 2007). We therefore tested a cdc16 allele (cdc16MB09129) that has a transposable element insertion in an intron of cdc16. However, this allele does not induce the lethality observed with Df(3R)BSC56, suggesting that either cdc16 is not the relevant gene or the allele we tested, which has not been extensively characterized, still produces sufficient active protein that allow embryonic development. We have shown previously that BubR1 kinase activity is essential during meiotic prophase I progression to ensure the correct timing of SC disassemble and chromosome NDJ in D. melanogaster female (Malmanche et al. 2007). Given the frequency of chromosome NDJ observed in a dose-sensitive manner in bubR1D1326N trans-heterozygotes, we decided to perform a genetic screen to identify third-chromosome haploinsufficient synthetic modifiers of the NDJ phenotype. We could test 65 of the 96 deficiencies that are part of the third chromosome deficiency kit generated by the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. We could not test all of them due to the presence of haplolethal and haplosterile loci (Marygold et al. 2007) in some deficiencies. Within the 60% of the euchromatin screened, we identified enhancers and suppressors of bubR1 X NDJ. Furthermore, we show that Polo kinase acts as a strong suppressor of female bubR1 X NDJ by delaying meiotic prophase I progression. Interestingly, we also found deficiencies that cause synthetic lethality or affect the fertility of the mutant females. Thus, this screen proved to be highly sensitive for the identification of modifiers of the BubR1 kinase activity. Ideally, this genetic screen should test simultaneously all mutant genetic backgrounds to minimize variables, such as temperature, humidity and food. However, because the genotype used to test NDJ only accounts for 1/6 of the total female F2 generation, all the third-chromosome deficiencies could not be tested at the same time. Therefore, we performed 16 different experiments. To classify the deficiencies as enhancer, suppressor, or having no effect, we took into account the variation in X NDJ observed in the control genotype and then performed a statistical analysis using the multinomial-Poisson hierarchy model (Zeng et al. 2010) with a 95% confidence interval. From the 65 deficiencies tested, we identified six deficiencies that enhance and 18 deficiencies that suppress female bubR1 X NDJ. From these 24 positive hits, we narrowed down the genomic region of interest using overlapping deficiencies for three enhancers [Df(3R)D605, Df(3L)Pc-2q and Df(3L)BSC13], and two suppressors [Df(3R)ED5559 and Df(3L)rdgC-co2] to identify the genes responsible for the modification of the X NDJ frequency. We identified the gene responsible for modification of X NDJ for two deficiencies: Df(3L)BSC13 and Df(3L)rdgC-co2. Further studies are needed to identify among the subset of candidate genes, those responsible for the modification of the female X NDJ for the other deficiencies. Despite the difficulties in identifying the gene involved in the process of X NDJ for every positive interaction, our genetic strategy allowed us to identify Polo kinase as a suppressor of bubR1 X NDJ. Our previous results (Malmanche et al. 2007) illustrate an essential requirement for BubR1 kinase activity in the timing of the early stages of meiotic prophase I, suggesting that BubR1 and Polo have opposite functions in early prophase I. BubR1 appears to slow down progression by maintaining the SC in place, whereas Polo accelerates the process by driving prophase I forward. Through indirect immunofluorescence, we confirmed that Polo dosage antagonizes BubR1 function during the early stages of meiotic prophase I, first by increasing SC and sister chromatin cohesion maintenance, and second by allowing a higher efficiency of bivalent reorganization during karyosome formation, as observed by the loading of the condensin subunit SMC2 at pachytene-diplotene transition. Our genetic screen also allowed the identification of two deficiencies that impair BubR1 kinase activity in somatic cells and zygotic development. It has been recently shown that BubR1 kinase activity is not essential for accurate somatic chromosome segregation and animal development, because BubR1 kinase dead homozygous adult flies lack any obvious phenotype and are recovered in a normal Mendelian proportion (Malmanche et al. 2007; Elowe et al. 2010). Nonetheless, although these results strongly suggest that BubR1 kinase activity is not essential for somatic development, our findings indicate that subtle modifications in the dosage of other key components of the cell cycle machinery can trigger an essential requirement for BubR1 kinase activity. Taken together, our results suggest that the genetic screen strategy presented above is highly efficient in recovering genes that interact with BubR1 kinase function. Our results allowed us to identify deficiencies showing genetic interactions, spanning from full recovery of X NDJ to sterility, the strongest effect expected for genes positively involved in BubR1 kinase activity. In addition, the screen also revealed an unexpected result, because it identified deficiencies that impaired zygotic development of BubR1 kinase dead embryos, suggesting a somatic phenotype. Further genetic and cytological experiments will allow the identification of genes responsible for the effect observed in the characterized deficiencies, allowing the build up of a genetic map of essential genes involved in BubR1 kinase function.

Our results verify the efficacy and efficiency of Stacks for inferring genetic loci and automated calling of genotypes. Stacks is implemented by component programs written in C++ and Perl, with the core algorithms parallelized using OpenMP libraries. Table 1 lists Stacks components along with a brief description of each. The Stacks web interface is implemented in PHP and, along with several component programs, stores and retrieves data from a MySQL database. The web interface interacts with the database using the MDB2 Pear module. Stacks is available as open source software under the GPL license and can be downloaded from http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/. The Stacks core component program is ustacks, which identifies unique loci de novo. To test ustacks, we created simulated datasets from the stickleback reference genome (BROAD S1, Ensembl version 59) by extracting 45,547 reads each 60 bp long in both directions at each SbfI restriction enzyme cut site (CCTGCAvGG) (Figure S1A). We re-diplodized the genome in silico by creating alleles (Figure S1B) into which we uniformly introduced single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at a rate of 0.5%. We \xe2\x80\x9csequenced\xe2\x80\x9d each allele to a depth determined by a draw from a Poisson distribution at three different mean sequencing depths (10\xc3\x97, 20\xc3\x97, and 40\xc3\x97) (Figure S1C). For each \xe2\x80\x9csequenced\xe2\x80\x9d read, we simulated sequencing errors at a rate that increased linearly along the sequence to mimic Illumina reads (Figure S1D). We investigated three mean error rates (0.5%, 1%, and 3%) to cover normal to high error rates. Each simulation run involved 10 replicates. For each dataset, ustacks was executed setting the within-individual distance parameter to two nucleotides and the stack-depth parameter to three identical reads. DNAs from the gynogenetic doubled haploid zebrafish HS mapping panel (Kelly et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2005) were prepared for RAD-tags according to Amores et al. (2011) and Etter et al. (2011). Progeny were sequenced with 60 bp reads in three Illumina GAII lanes, resulting in 70,921,725 raw reads, of which 57,451,403 were retained after cleaning. Because DNA of the original female parent was no longer available, we combined all reads from her gynogenetic progeny to create a synthetic maternal genome and processed the content through Stacks. We executed the Stacks pipeline with a stack-depth parameter of three and a within-individual distance parameter of two and constructed a linkage map using JoinMap (Van Ooijen 2006). While Stacks has no limit to the number of markers it can handle, JoinMap is limited to about 8000 markers. To work around this deficiency in JoinMap, we subdivided Stacks output into overlapping datasets small enough for JoinMap to handle and then ran JoinMap to construct linkage groups, using markers shared in overlapping datasets to identify corresponding linkage groups. Linkage group\xe2\x80\x93specific datasets with fewer than 8000 markers each were finally loaded into JoinMap to identify locus order. Besides comparing the RAD-tag map to a previously published meiotic map, we also aligned RAD-tag markers to the physical genome (Zv9, Ensembl version 61) by BLASTn. These searches used an e-value cutoff of 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9217 (to allow for sequencing errors and for polymorphisms between the reference genome and the HS panel) and required a unique best hit to the reference genome or a top hit with a raw BLAST score at least an order of magnitude greater than the second best hit with 70% of the query sequence aligned. Genotypes for markers present in at least 36 of the 42 HS map cross individuals were exported into JoinMap 4.0 (Van Ooijen 2006). Linkage between markers, recombination rate, and map distances were calculated using the Kosambi mapping function and the maximum likelihood function in JoinMap. Markers were grouped at an initial logarithm of the odds (LOD) threshold of 7.0, and small linkage groups were incorporated using the strong cross-link feature of JoinMap at a minimum LOD of 5.0. Markers with strong segregation distortion or that appeared unlinked at LOD < 5.0 were excluded. We designed Stacks as a modular pipeline to efficiently curate and assemble large numbers of short-read sequences from multiple samples. Stacks identifies loci in a set of individuals, either de novo or aligned to a reference genome, and then genotypes each locus. Stacks incorporates a maximum likelihood statistical model to identify sequence polymorphisms and distinguish them from sequencing errors. Stacks employs a Catalog to record all loci identified in a population and matches individuals to that Catalog to determine which haplotype alleles are present at every locus in each individual. Stacks stores results in a MySQL database and displays them through a web interface that facilitates marker annotation. The database also allows linking markers to other sequence information, such as RNA-seq data (Mortazavi et al. 2008). Stacks can export data as genotypes for JoinMap (Van Ooijen 2006) or R/qtl (Broman et al. 2003) or as a set of observed haplotypes for a general population. Because Stacks was originally designed to build meiotic maps (Amores et al. 2011), some pipeline terminology pertains to genetic mapping, but Stacks can be used for nearly any analysis using genomically localized short-read sequences. We describe here how the pipeline functions to build a genetic map de novo, and then how it can use a reference genome. Finally, we describe the testing of Stacks by simulation and by reconstructing a zebrafish genetic map. The Stacks component programs are discussed below and described in Table 1. The discussion here assumes that input to Stacks is composed of RAD-seq data (Figure 1A) from the parents and progeny of a genetic cross. Stacks builds map markers by identifying loci and their constituent alleles in each individual (Figure 1A\xe2\x80\x93F) and by creating a Catalog of parental loci (Figure 1G). Stacks then matches progeny against the Catalog (Figure 1H), which defines alleles at each locus in each individual. At each stage, Stacks exports outputs into a MySQL database. Stacks schematic. (A) The ustacks program forms stacks in an individual from short sequencing reads (cleaned by process_radtags.pl) that match exactly. (B) The ustacks program breaks down the sequence of each stack into k-mers and loads them into a dictionary. The ustacks program breaks down each stack again into k-mers and queries the k-mer Dictionary to create a list of potentially matching stacks, which can be visualized as nodes in a graph connected by the nucleotide distance between them. (C) ustacks merges matched stacks to form putative loci. (D) ustacks matches secondary reads that were not initially placed in a stack against putative loci to increase stack depth. An SNP model in ustacks checks each locus at each nucleotide position for polymorphisms. (E) ustacks calls a consensus sequence and records SNP and haplotype data. (F) The cstacks program loads stacks from the parents of a genetic cross into a Catalog to create a set of all possible loci in a mapping cross. (G) sstacks matches map cross progeny against the Catalog to determine the haplotypes at each locus in every individual in the cross. Stacks requires clean sequence data in FASTA or FASTQ output files (e.g., Kelley et al. 2010) using the program process_radtags.pl. The process_radtags.pl program examines each read using a sliding window: if the average quality score within a window drops below 90% confidence [a Phred score of 10, Ewing and Green (1998)], Stacks discards the read. Thus, Stacks accepts reads with isolated errors but detects reads with prolonged drops in quality and discards them. Uncalled nucleotides, nonexistent barcodes, or deficient restriction enzyme cut sites can also cause Stacks to exclude reads. Stacks can correct isolated errors in the restriction cut site sequence or in the barcode if the barcode is two or more nucleotides distant in sequence space from other barcodes used in the same sequencing library. The ustacks (unique stacks) program reads cleaned sequences and distills data into unique, exactly matching stacks by loading reads into a hash table (Figure 1A). Unique stacks that contain fewer reads than a configurable threshold (the stack-depth parameter) are disassembled, and the reads are set aside because these stacks are indistinguishable from stacks generated with sequencing error. Reads in a stack are primary reads, and reads that are set aside are secondary reads. The ustacks program calculates the average depth of coverage, then identifies stacks that are two standard deviations above the mean and excludes them, along with all stacks that are one nucleotide apart from these extremely deep (lumberjack) stacks, which usually represent repetitive elements. Polymorphic genetic loci produce stacks that differ in few nucleotides. A k-mer search algorithm defines loci based on a user-specified distance between stacks (the within-individual distance parameter). This configurable distance depends on the dataset\xe2\x80\x99s genetic properties, such as polymorphism rate and read length, and usually allows just a few nucleotide differences. To implement this comparison, ustacks breaks the sequence of each stack into a set of overlapping fragments of equal length k (k-mers) (Edgar 2004; Vinga and Almeida 2003) (Figure 1B). The first k-mer spans nucleotides 1 to k, the second 2 to k\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa01, the third 3 to k\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa02, and so on. The ustacks program automatically maximizes k-mer length according to the allowed nucleotide difference (longer k-mer lengths produce less promiscuous k-mers that require fewer comparisons to other reads) and loads k-mers into the Dictionary (Figure 1B). The ustacks program queries the k-mer Dictionary with each k-mer from each stack to identify other stacks with matching k-mers. For pairs of stacks with sufficient numbers of matching k-mers, ustacks aligns the pair, naively matching nucleotide by nucleotide to verify that each pair of stacks is within the allowable nucleotide distance, and if they are, it records a match. The k-mer search algorithm transitively relates pairs of stacks. For example, if stacks 4 and 5 match and stacks 5 and 6 match with an allowable distance of one nucleotide, ustacks records two matching pairs (Figure 1C). Then ustacks merges all matching pairs, in this case merging 4, 5, and 6, even though 4 and 6 are two nucleotides apart. Merged stacks represent putative loci displayed as a graph with nodes representing unique stacks and edges weighted by the nucleotide distance between them (Figure 1C). In a full graph containing all stacks in the dataset, each putative locus represents a disconnected subgraph (Figure 1C). In a diploid genetic cross, homozygous and heterozygous loci should contain one and two stacks, respectively. Allowing for some error, if more than three unique stacks have been merged, or if the coverage of the merged stack is more than two standard deviations above the mean coverage, ustacks shunts the stack to the deleveraging algorithm to determine which subset of these large stacks is most likely to represent a locus (see Appendix 1). The process of merging stacks is iterative. With a user-specified distance of three nucleotides between stacks, ustacks first finds stacks that are a single nucleotide different and merges them, then continues at a distance of two, and finally at a distance of three. At the end of each round, ustacks excludes lumberjack stacks. Secondary reads (2\xc2\xb0 reads, Figure 1E) that were set aside earlier are now matched against putative loci using the k-mer search algorithm but with greater nucleotide distance (two nucleotides larger than the within-individual distance parameter by default). Secondary reads that do not have a best match to a unique defined locus are discarded. At the end of this stage, Stacks has constructed a set of putative loci from high-confidence unique stacks and has buttressed locus depth by adding secondary reads. The next step is to identify polymorphisms within loci. To detect polymorphisms and infer alleles (Figure 1E), ustacks examines each putative locus one nucleotide position at a time using a maximum likelihood framework (Hohenlohe et al. 2010) (see Appendix 1). Some loci have polymorphisms at more than one position, but rarely in a short-read locus would a recombination event occur between two polymorphisms; hence, the configuration of SNPs at a locus represents a haplotype. SNPs and haplotypes are visualized as a two-dimensional matrix containing stacked sequencing reads (Figure 1E). Stacks identifies SNPs by examining the matrix column-wise and calls haplotypes by examining the matrix row-wise. Haplotypes that define alleles in each locus become genetic markers for subsequent analyses. Finally, Stacks determines a consensus sequence for each locus (Figure 1F). At this point, Stacks has constructed loci for one individual (the large top box, Figure 1A\xe2\x80\x93F). After Stacks has accomplished this task for a number of individuals (e.g., the two parents in a genetic cross), cstacks (Catalog stacks, Figure 1G) synthesizes a Catalog of loci that appear in members of the population. The cstacks program reads the output from ustacks and merges loci into the Catalog. The first individual (say, the female parent of the cross) initializes the Catalog. Each additional individual is then merged into the Catalog in turn. Individual loci are matched to those already in the Catalog using the same k-mer search algorithm used by ustacks, except that each locus is represented in the k-mer dictionary by the set of k-mers resulting from each haplotype at that locus. When two loci match, cstacks merges their SNPs in the Catalog. If, however, those SNPs have conflicting alleles (for example, a fixed A in the Catalog and a segregating G/C in the locus that is being merged in), the merge fails and cstacks issues a warning. The cstacks program adjusts its haplotype calls based on the newly merged SNPs. The between-individual distance parameter of cstacks allows for mismatches while merging loci into the Catalog. If each parent is fixed for a different allele at a particular locus, cstacks can detect the mismatch and properly merge the loci. This property is particularly useful when fixed differences occur, as in crosses between inbred populations or between divergent species. To identify which locus/haplotype combinations are present in each individual in the population, sstacks (search stacks) matches every individual in the cross, including the parents and the progeny, against the Catalog (Figure 1H). The sstacks program constructs a hash table from every haplotype in the Catalog, compares all haplotypes from an individual, and records matches. Loci that match more than one Catalog locus are excluded because their true matching locus in the Catalog is ambiguous; multiple loci, however, can still uniquely match the same Catalog tag (these could represent, for example, repetitive sequences in the progeny that are not in the parents); users can elect to exclude these in later analyses. At this stage, Stacks has identified haplotypes segregating in each individual in the population. Next Stacks identifies informative markers. The markers.pl program identifies mappable markers in the parents by downloading Catalog matches from the MySQL database and tallying up all the matching parental haplotypes. The markers.pl program characterizes parental loci into 10 classes of mappable markers, including loci that are segregating in the family due to variation in a single parent (ab/\xe2\x80\x93, two alleles, a and b, in one parent, and a missing restriction site in the second parent), loci homozygous within parents but heterozygous between parents (aa/bb), loci with two (ab/aa), three (ab/ac), or four (ab/cd) haplotypes, as well as other related types (Table 2). Stacks has now processed enough data to genotype map cross progeny, but it first must build an index in the MySQL database to unify the outputs of the previous analyses. The index_radtags.pl program performs this task and provides results to the web interface. This business logic is implemented in the denovo_map.pl program, which executes ustacks, cstacks, sstacks, markers.pl, and index_radtags.pl, and then uploads data to the database. At this point, Stacks calls genotypes from map cross progeny using genotypes.pl after specifying a particular map type (F1, F2, doubled haploid, or back cross) and an export type (JoinMap or R/qtl). The genotypes.pl program maps haplotypes in the progeny to the marker types detected in the parents. First, genotypes.pl downloads from the database the set of loci containing mappable markers recorded by markers.pl. It then maps haplotypes: if the first parent has haplotypes GA and AC, and the second parent has the GA haplotype, Stacks declares an ab/aa marker for this locus. The genotypes.pl program maps GA to a, and AC to b in the parents and checks progeny to see which haplotypes each contains, recording the genotypes (either ab or aa, in this case). Finally, genotypes.pl formats genotypes for use with the mapping program and outputs a properly formatted file. Users can specify the minimum number of matching progeny required for locus export. Users can tell the genotypes.pl program to perform automated corrections for certain errors, including checking homozygous tags in the progeny to ensure that a SNP is not present. As described in Appendix 1, if the SNP model cannot identify a site as heterozygous or homozygous, the site is tentatively labeled a homozygote to facilitate matching to the Catalog in sstacks. If a second allele identified in the Catalog (i.e., in the parents) is present in a progeny individual at a low frequency (less than 10% of reads in the stack), genotypes.pl corrects the genotype. Likewise, genotypes.pl removes a homozygous genotype call for a particular individual if the locus contains fewer than five reads supporting the genotype. Users can adjust these thresholds. The genotypes.pl program can optionally output a file formatted for loading into the database. The web interface allows users to manually correct genotypes. For example, a stack for Locus 1 in one of the progeny (Figure 1E) might have just one A allele but 19 C alleles. Stacks would call the genotype as homozygous C, not being able to distinguish the single A from a sequencing error. But if a homozygous C call results in a double cross-over involving this single locus, the genotype is more likely to be heterozygous C/A with the A allele undersequenced. Users can make this correction through the web interface, and the corrected genotype will be included on the next execution of genotypes.pl. Stacks can identify loci not only de novo as described above but also using a reference genome. The two processes differ: instead of building stacks and loci from similar sequence reads, Stacks first aligns sequence reads to the reference genome using Bowtie (Langmead et al. 2009). And instead of invoking ustacks, we use pstacks (population stacks), which reads either Bowtie or SAM (Li et al. 2009) files and builds stacks based on alignment positions. SNP calling proceeds as before, and parameters exist for both cstacks and sstacks to build Catalog loci and to match against those loci, respectively, based on reference genome alignment positions instead of sequence distance. The business logic of this pipeline is embodied in the ref_map.pl program, which executes each stage and loads the resulting data into the database. Because pstacks and ustacks output the same file formats, the web interface displays them as in a genetic map. Mini-contigs from Rad-seq paired-end reads can be assembled and added to Stacks, thereby providing several hundred additional genomic nucleotides downstream of each marker that increase hits to expressed sequence tags libraries and thus connect markers to protein coding genes in other organisms (Amores et al. 2011; Etter et al. 2011). The sort_read_pairs.pl program collates paired-end reads associated with each stack and outputs a FASTA file for each locus in the catalog. Users can execute a program such as Velvet (Zerbino and Birney 2008), which assembles reads in each FASTA file, to form contigs that can then be loaded into the Stacks MySQL database using the Stacks load_sequences.pl program. The load_sequences.pl program assumes that the sequence definition line, which is preceded by a \xe2\x80\x9cgreater than sign\xe2\x80\x9d (>) for each sequence in a FASTA file, is a Catalog locus ID, and will store that sequence in the MySQL database linked to the Catalog locus. Therefore, in addition to mini-contigs, if ESTs are available or were constructed de novo using RNA-seq (Mortazavi et al. 2008), they can also be loaded into the database after they are matched to catalog loci using a program such as Bowtie or BLAST (Altschul et al. 1997). Any sequence data loaded into the MySQL database can later be exported in association with their markers using export_catalog.pl. In summary, the Stacks importing and exporting capabilities can associate Stacks markers with additional sequences, including mini-contigs and ESTs. These sequence sets can associate mappable loci in protein coding genes to orthologs in other species by BLAST searches, or to genomic contigs in an emerging reference genome. Stacks provides a web-based interface for viewing, annotating and correcting loci in a population (Figure 2). The web interface displays haplotypes present in every individual (Figure 2A) and clicking on a haplotype returns the appropriate stack (Figure 2B). The web interface, coupled with the MySQL database backend, provides extensive filtering capabilities, which facilitate the separation of useful data from background error, and it can export observed haplotypes as a Microsoft Excel document. This modular design allows Stacks, the database, and the web-based user interface to be located on the same or remote servers. Stacks web interface. (A) The interface allows a researcher to view observed haplotypes at each locus in all individuals. (B) Researchers can click each haplotype to view the stack itself. The interface provides extensive filtering facilities as well as the ability to annotate and export results in a number of formats, including Excel, JoinMap, and R/qtl. To test the ability of ustacks to identify loci, we simulated the RAD-seq process from the well-assembled genome sequence of threespine stickleback. We generated data at a per-allele mean sequencing depth of 10\xc3\x97, 20\xc3\x97, and 40\xc3\x97, and we varied the sequencing error rate from 0.5 to 3%. In Figure 3, Reference Loci (Figure 3A) represents loci present in the stickleback reference genome (Ensembl version 59) after the RAD-seq simulation, whereas Observed Stacks (Figure 3B) represents data discovered by Stacks. Results showed that, at low and moderate error rates, ustacks correctly reconstructed nearly all (86%) known loci (Figure 3A, B). A comparison of Reference Loci and Observed Stacks, however (Figure 3A, B), shows that ustacks collapsed repetitive sequences. Apart from repetitive sequences, less than 1% of stacks assembled incorrectly. At the highest error rate (3%) and lowest coverage (10\xc3\x97), about 51% of the known loci disappeared from the results, but at 20\xc3\x97 coverage, Stacks identified most loci (81% correctly assembled), and at 40\xc3\x97 coverage, the error rate had little effect on the number of identified loci (86% correctly assembled, Figure 3A, B). Loci disappeared from the dataset likely due to low depth of coverage, which occurs by chance, as well as reads confounded by error. Stacks simulation results. The stickleback reference genome was digested in silico by SbfI, and 60 bp reads were made from each direction from the 22,774 cut sites at several different sequencing depths with several different error rates. The left panel shows the number of (A) loci, (B) stacks, and (C) SNPs observed in the Stacks output. Loci that Stacks assembled incorrectly are displayed in a dark color, whereas loci containing repetitive sequences are shown in a crosshatch pattern. A comparison of the number of loci present in the dataset (A) vs. the number of stacks reconstructed (B) showed that ustacks collapsed repetitive loci but correctly reconstructed nearly all other loci at low and moderate error rates or at high coverage. The right panel shows the number of reads with a certain number of sequencing errors that were incorporated into correct stacks, incorrect stacks, and unused reads for 20\xc3\x97 coverage and error rates of (D) 0.5%, (E) 1%, and (F) 3%. As errors accumulated, Stacks excluded more reads, lowering the overall depth, whereas some reads accumulated enough errors to be incorporated into stacks that appeared to be correctly assembled but, in fact, joined stacks representing loci from which they did not originate (indicated by reads with more errors than allowed by the k-mer matching algorithm, four errors in the simulation). The simulation further showed that ustacks robustly identified SNPs, except at a high error rate and low depth of coverage, or when confounded by repetitive sequences (Figure 3C). These data show that excess frugality or oversequencing are both wasteful. At the highest error rate and under the parameters of this simulation, moving from a per-allele depth of 10\xc3\x97 to 20\xc3\x97 gains 14,000 additional loci, whereas moving from 20\xc3\x97 to 40\xc3\x97, which also doubles sequencing cost, nets only an additional 2400 loci. To further study locus drop out and error rates, we examined the effect of error rate on the distribution of errors per read. Because our simulation allowed tracking the origin of each read, we could deduce that, at the lowest error rate, reads that ended up in either correct stacks or in incorrect stacks contained no more errors than are allowed by the k-mer matching algorithm (four errors, in the worst case) (Figure 3D). In contrast, reads that could not be assigned to a stack (unused reads) tended to have more errors even at the lowest error rate (Figure 3D). At higher error rates, the number of unused reads increased greatly, from approximately 6000 at 0.5% to about 200,000 at 3%, thus decreasing stack depth (Figure 3E, F). Reads with more errors than allowed by the matching algorithm (again, four errors) accumulated in all three categories of reads at a 3% error rate (Figure 3F). The accumulation of error-riddled reads in correctly assembled stacks indicates that some reads suffered enough error to make them more similar to a different locus than to their original, known locus. These results demonstrate that raw sequence quality has a strong effect on the ability of Stacks to successfully reconstruct loci. Simulation data revealed the interacting effects of SNPs, sequencing depth, and error rate on stack quality. First, consider the effect of introducing SNPs into simulated reads. The known distribution of stacks with a particular sequencing depth (Figure 4A, dotted red line) showed a peak at 40\xc3\x97, twice the average sequencing depth, because a diploid has two alleles at each locus. Without the introduction of SNPs or error, ustacks produced a rather erratic distribution of stack depth (Figure 4A, gray line) with peaks at 80\xc3\x97 and 120\xc3\x97 due to the erroneous collapsing of two or three loci known to be different because of their known origin in the stickleback genome. Furthermore, ustacks collapsed over 6000 repetitive SbfI RAD loci in the stickleback genome into a smaller number of loci with very high depths of coverage, as indicated by the long right tail of the distribution that stretches far beyond the truncated display in the figure. The introduction of SNPs into the simulated reads at a rate of 0.5% caused a shoulder to appear on the distribution at 20\xc3\x97, half the depth of the main peak (Figure 4A, green line). These erroneous stacks of approximately 20\xc3\x97 depth appeared because ustacks failed to find and join the alternative alleles for these stacks. Stacks depth of coverage distribution. (A) Correctly reconstructed stacks have a depth of coverage equal to twice the mean sequencing coverage because the simulation assumes diploid individuals. With no polymorphism or error (gray line), the depth of coverage distribution nearly matched the known simulation distribution (dotted red line), with the exception of repetitive loci, which created the long tail of the distribution to the right, which was truncated at 200\xc3\x97 but extends to 17,000\xc3\x97. After adding SNPs, ustacks failed to reconstruct a small number of loci (green arrow) as shown by the increase in stacks with a depth of coverage equal to the sequencing mean depth.

ror and increasing mean sequencing depth, most stacks were still properly reconstructed. Results showed a repeating pattern of improperly reconstructed stacks occurring at multiples of the mean sequencing depth corresponding to the number of loci improperly merged together. The increasing error rate caused a general loss of depth in the stacks (green vs. violet lines). To explore the effects of error rate on locus quality, we studied, at three levels of mean coverage, the effects of a typical low error rate of 0.5% and an unusually high error rate of 3.0% (Figure 4B, C). At 10\xc3\x97 mean coverage and 0.5% error, the distribution of correctly formed loci matched closely that of the true distribution, differing only by having somewhat fewer loci (a 14% reduction) than actually exist (Figure 4B). This decrease came from two types of incorrectly joined stacks: some incorrect stacks occupied a peak at 10\xc3\x97, representing single stacks for which ustacks could not identify their true alternative alleles due to errors, and other incorrect stacks fell in a peak at 40\xc3\x97, representing cases in which ustacks inappropriately joined four stacks coming from two independent diploid loci. And still other stacks in the long tail represented the fusing of repetitive loci. An error rate six times higher (3%) reduced the number of correctly joined stacks to 49% of the true number and resulted in the loss of the peak at 10\xc3\x97 found with the lower error rate. We conclude that high error rates cause inappropriate joining of stacks more frequently than incorrect failure to fuse stacks. With the introduction of errors at sequencing depths of 20\xc3\x97 and higher, the distribution of correctly joined stacks shifted slightly to the left due to the accumulation of unused reads (Figure 4C, D, green vs. purple lines). In sum, these simulations demonstrate remarkable fidelity of locus identification, even in the face of mounting errors, when the sequencing depth is between 20\xc3\x97 and 40\xc3\x97. If Stacks works well, it should reconstruct a known genome map. To test this prediction, we constructed for Danio rerio a genetic map (RADmap) by using RAD-seq and Stacks to re-genotype a previously published doubled haploid mapping panel (HSmap, http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-crossview.apg&OID=ZDB-REFCROSS-000320-1) that consists of 42 progeny (Kelly et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2005). Stacks reconstructed the 25 zebrafish linkage groups (Figure S2), each with a length nearly identical to the original (Figure 5, 3186 cM in the HSmap vs. 3160 cM in the RADmap). With 7861 markers, our RADmap has nearly twice as many markers as the original HSmap (4073 markers), but it required less than 1% of the cost and took less than 1% of the time to genotype and construct. The RADmap and HSmap had nearly identical marker order (Figure S3); differences could represent errors in either map. Danio rerio RAD-tag map compared to the doubled haploid map. We constructed a RAD-seq genetic map of zebrafish (RADmap) using DNA from 42 individuals of the doubled haploid mapping panel (HSmap) that had been previously genotyped by microsatellites or single strand conformation polymorphism (Kelly et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2000; Woods et al. 2005). Stacks recovered the 25 zebrafish linkage groups (Figure S2) with lengths nearly identical to published values (3186 cM in the HSmap vs. 3160 cM in the RADmap). With 7861 markers, our RADmap had nearly twice as many markers as appeared in the HSmap (4073 markers). The insert shows the scale for marker density. A comparison of the zebrafish RADmap to the sequenced reference genome showed alignment of 5787 RADmap markers and revealed that marker order for the RADmap and the physical assembly generally agreed (Figure 6). An additional 157 mapped RADmap markers aligned to genomic scaffolds that are currently unordered in the Zv9 reference genome, thus positioning these errant contigs into the reference genome. RADmap marker order is consistent with the sequenced zebrafish genome. A specific region on LG20 with no recombination in the RADmap spanned almost 10 Mb in the physical genome (inset). This recombination suppression could be due to a heterozygous inversion present in the genome of the mother of the gynogenetic HS mapping panel. A plot of the RADmap vs. the reference genome identified several regions of low recombination rate per physical distance. One region in LG20 showed recombination suppression in the RADmap over a region of about 10 Mb (Figure 6, inset) that could be due to a heterozygous inversion in the mother of the HS mapping panel, who was a heterozygote of the clonal C32 line and the highly inbred SJD strains (Nechiporuk et al. 1999; Streisinger et al. 1986). This hypothesis, generated by the extraordinarily high density of RAD markers, warrants further investigation. LG4, which is chromosome 3 in the physical genome (Phillips et al. 2006), has a mostly heterochromatic long arm, whose repetitive elements would produce lumberjack stacks that would be excluded from analysis. Markers off the diagonal of Figure 5 could be due to errors either in the RADmap, in the BLAST assignment of RADmap markers to the physical genome, or in the physical assembly. These results show that RAD-tag markers can recapitulate a known genetic map at greater density and with less time and expense than methodologies currently in use. Analyzing RAD-seq data with Stacks can recover hundreds to tens of thousands of informative markers that describe the genetics of a population. Stacks has been used to generate an ultradense genetic map using the F1 offspring of wild-caught spotted gar (Amores et al. 2011), to examine the phylogeographic distribution of the mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii (Emerson et al. 2010), and to generate informative SNPs in trout populations (Hohenlohe et al. 2011). The zebrafish map constructed de novo here and compared with a well-assembled sequenced genome demonstrates the rapid nature of this approach that took a few weeks of part-time effort, whereas a previous map using the same DNAs required several years to construct, cost 100 times as much, and had half the number of markers. Having shown the biological precision of Stacks, we now discuss how to increase its informative value by iteratively improving data and associating loci to additional sequence data. Appendix 2 presents methods to optimize Stacks, including alternative strategies to build the Catalog and to adjust important Stacks parameters. Not all RAD-seq loci appear in all individuals due to polymorphisms in restriction enzyme cut sites, stochastic events related to sequencing (as our simulations showed), PCR errors, or sequencing errors. Loci that appear in a large number of individuals in a population or in a large number of map cross progeny are the most reliable. Once Stacks has generated a set of markers, it is most effective to select markers supported in as many progeny as possible by using the set of filters provided in the web interface (Figure 2) or by specifying a minimum number of progeny when exporting genotypes. One of the key attributes of Stacks is its convenient web interface, which supports manual corrections. Iterative corrections can make significant improvements in a genetic map based on the principle that double recombinants in a short genetic distance are unlikely events. Manual examination of markers that expand the map can identify, correct, or remove troublesome genotypes, followed by re-exporting data and reconstructing the map. Reiteration can provide a genetic map with strong statistical support on all linkage groups. Genome duplication events, like those that occurred in the stems of vertebrate, teleost, salmonid, and flowering plant lineages (Allendorf and Danzmann 1997; Amores et al. 1998; Dehal and Boore 2005; Koop et al. 2008; Jiao et al. 2011), result in paralogs that are initially identical but diverge over time. In some cases, Stacks might erroneously confuse paralogs that have nearly identical sequences with alleles of the same locus. Fortunately, Stacks can detect \xe2\x80\x9covermerging\xe2\x80\x9d of paralogous stacks because all individuals homozygous for a specific sequence at one paralog and homozygous for a slightly different sequence in the other paralog would appear to be heterozygotes for the relevant SNP. In contrast, a meiotic mapping population that is segregating a SNP at one locus or a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium would have, on average, only about half of the individuals being heterozygotes. In addition, a diploid individual will never have more than two alleles of a single locus, so if individuals are discovered with three or more alleles, paralogs are likely to blame. Stacks can detect markers in which observed heterozygosity is significantly different than expected and flag them. The problem of confusing paralogs with allelic variants is evolutionarily transitory. Identical stacks (as might be found for paralogs in recent tetraploids) are uninformative and don\xe2\x80\x99t cause a problem; furthermore, a few neutral mutations are sufficient for Stacks to identify paralogous loci, particularly if the user sets the within-distance parameter to a small value. In a recent study of trout populations, Stacks flagged loci that differed from Hardy-Weinberg expectations, thereby successfully removing the effects of the recent (25\xe2\x80\x93100 million years ago) salmonid genome duplication (Hohenlohe et al. 2011). The stringency of applied filters should depend on a number of factors that reflect both the biology of the species (e.g., time since duplication) and the experimental goals (e.g., trade-off between marker number and marker reliability). In some cases, however, the indiscriminate filtering of loci that do not appear to meet Hardy-Weinberg expectations can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, in a recent moss linkage map, 45% of the loci exhibited segregation distortion, likely due to lethal interactions between distant loci (Mcdaniel et al. 2007). Thus, while Stacks can flag markers that do not fit expectations, careful interpretation is required to understand the biology of the species. Given the high marker density of a RAD-seq genetic map and the fact that those markers consist of genomic sequence, BLAST searches can associate markers or mini-contigs to ESTs, such as those generated by RNA-seq, or to orthologous genes in other species (Amores et al. 2011). These features make comparative genomics a natural extension of a Stacks analysis. The Stacks database contains several tables supporting the importation of paired-end mini-contigs or RNA-seq-assembled ESTs. A table also exists to store BLAST hits from markers, mini-contigs, or ESTs, and the web interface displays these data. Combined with programs in Stacks that import and export these sequences from the database, it becomes straightforward to perform conserved synteny analyses on genetic maps (see Amores et al. 2011). Mini-contigs can be exported to help design PCR primers for marker-assisted selection or to isolate genomic clones for specific markers in the genetic map. In addition, Stacks facilitates the alignment of genomic contigs from an emerging, often highly fragmented, reference genome assembly to the genetic map, thereby creating linkage group\xe2\x80\x93based scaffolds from the physical contigs. Nearly a century after the first genetic maps (Sturtevant 1913), Stacks, coupled with massively parallel DNA sequencing, makes the genetic map relevant again. Because Stacks and RAD-seq rapidly and inexpensively provide unprecedented numbers of genetic markers, fragmented genome assemblies can be ordered, and variation existing in single individuals taken directly from the wild can provide genetic maps with genome-wide comparative information. In addition, Stacks makes genome-wide association studies (GWAS) more tractable in nonmodel species because the enormous linkage map provides a framework for the analysis of population genomic data.

Bassham for coining the term \xe2\x80\x9cstacks.\xe2\x80\x9d The Stacks software, and its description in this manuscript, was improved by discussions with other members of the Postlethwait and Cresko laboratories.

Given a connected graph of unique stacks, the deleveraging algorithm contained in ustacks determines which subset of stacks is most likely to represent a locus. This heuristic program assumes that stacks originating from the same locus have approximately the same depth of coverage; for example, a true stack should have greater depth of coverage than stacks resulting from sequencing errors but less depth than stacks derived from repetitive elements. To achieve the goal of identifying the true components of the locus, the deleveraging algorithm first scales edges in the graph (which reflect nucleotide distance) by the log of the difference in depth of coverage between nodes. Nodes with a small nucleotide distance and relatively equal depths of coverage will be connected by an edge weighted with a very small distance in the graph, whereas nodes separated by a large nucleotide distance and/or a large difference in depth of coverage will be connected by an edge weighted by a large distance. Stacks feeds these scaled distances into a hierarchical clustering algorithm (de Hoon 2010) that arranges stacks in a tree according to distances that separate stacks from one another. This resulting tree is split into two groups, one representing the most closely related nodes in the tree, and the other containing the rest. For example, given a set of five stacks that have been grouped into a putative locus, where two stacks have coverage depth similar to that of the mean and where the other three stacks are shallow due to sequencing errors, the deleveraging algorithm is successful if it can separate the two real stacks from the stacks with sequencing errors. After the deleveraging algorithm executes, Stacks checks the maximum distance between the nodes in both clusters, and if this distance is greater than the user-specified nucleotide distance (the within-individual distance parameter), the lumberjack stack is blacklisted and excluded from use in the remainder of the pipeline; otherwise, the grouped loci persist in the dataset. At each nucleotide position in a locus, Stacks adapts the single-nucleotide, diploid genotyping method described by (Hohenlohe et\xc2\xa0al. 2010). This approach considers the counts of each of the four possible nucleotides in a multinomial sampling and uses a likelihood ratio test to assess the significance of the most likely genotype. The sequencing error rate is estimated implicitly by maximum likelihood at each position, and a significance level of \xce\xb1 = 0.05 is used (without correction for multiple testing) to assign a diploid genotype (homozygote or heterozygote) at each position for each individual (Hohenlohe et\xc2\xa0al. 2010). If this likelihood ratio test is not significant, due either to low coverage or to read counts that lie between expectations for a heterozygote and a homozygote with error, then the model considers the location to be a homozygote for the most commonly observed nucleotide. This procedure avoids uncalled bases in the subsequent merging of stacks. The genotypes.pl program later corrects these genotypes by using information across individuals in the dataset. Future versions of Stacks will allow prior distributions to be placed on the sequencing error parameter and the significance level \xce\xb1 to accommodate known attributes of the dataset, and it will dynamically modify thresholds that determine when a particular genotype call is significant. The cstacks program, which builds the Catalog, can accept data from an arbitrary number of individuals. The Catalog was designed to contain all possible loci that might appear in an analysis. The merging of each additional individual into the Catalog, however, brings with it a small number of erroneous stacks. In the case of a genetic map, the choice of what to load into the Catalog is simple: the parents of the cross contain all possible loci present in the progeny and thus together act as a natural limit to the number of loci that will be in their progeny; hence, the parents should appear in the Catalog. In a population genomic investigation, however, loading individuals into the Catalog is likely to increase the number of erroneous loci in the Catalog as a function of the number of individuals loaded. One strategy around this problem is to create a \xe2\x80\x9csuperparent,\xe2\x80\x9d a virtual individual created by combining reads from many individuals. The ustacks program builds stacks from the superparent normally, and cstacks loads them into the Catalog. If the investigated individuals are members of different subpopulations (say, lake vs. marine fish or different plant ecotypes), then a superparent could be built from each subpopulation with several superparents loaded into the Catalog. This approach works well for correctly identifying loci with a moderate to high frequency of\xc2\xa0minor alleles in the population sample, which is likely to be a primary application of Stacks. Note, however, that the multinomial sampling model in the genotyping algorithm applies strictly to single diploid individuals, where alternative alleles in a single heterozygous individual are expected to appear in a stack in roughly equal frequencies. Rare alleles in a population might be erroneously excluded by this approach because the program treats their SNPs as sequencing errors in the superparent. In the future, we plan to eliminate stacks representing errors by comparing loci across a population and eliminating very low frequency haplotypes at a particular locus, which may obviate the need to construct superparents. Users can specify three major parameters when running the Stacks pipeline de novo. The stack-depth parameter controls the\xc2\xa0minimum number of identical reads required to form a stack. In our empirical work, we have had success using a\xc2\xa0minimum depth of three, although this number should scale along with the number of raw reads available. The second parameter, the within-individual distance parameter, is the maximum number of nucleotide mismatches allowed between stacks before fusing two or more stacks into a locus. If this parameter is set too low, loci containing multiple SNPs per haplotype will not be recovered. If it is set too high, Stacks will incorrectly combine distinct genetic loci that happen to be near each other in sequence space. The default value is two nucleotides, but we have had success using a value of up to four. This parameter must be sensitive to the biology (for example, duplication history) of the species. The third parameter, called the between-individual distance parameter, is the number of mismatches allowed between loci in the Catalog. The between-individual distance parameter allows Stacks to detect loci that are homozygous in individuals but polymorphic between individuals. By default, Stacks sets catalog-mismatch to zero; increasing the catalog-mismatch limit can have the same potentially negative effects as increasing the within-individual distance parameter. The most appropriate value for the between-individual distance parameter varies with the evolutionary distance of the parents of the cross or of the members of the population being examined. In a standard F2 mapping cross, an F1 pseudo-testcross [as in the gar map (Amores et\xc2\xa0al. 2011)], or the zebrafish doubled haploid cross, zero is appropriate for the between-individual distance parameter. In contrast, with highly divergent populations, a higher value might be more appropriate because different populations might be fixed for different alleles of the same locus. A reasonable approach is to set the between-individual distance parameter to the same value as the within-individual distance parameter if one expects fixed alleles in the parents of a cross or in members of a population.

Lenski', 'Dominique Schneider']","August 8, 2011.",Mutation Rate Inferred From Synonymous Substitutions in a Long-Term Evolution Experiment With Escherichia coli,"b'The quantification of spontaneous mutation rates is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of the evolutionary process. In bacteria, traditional estimates using experimental or comparative genetic methods are prone to statistical uncertainty and consequently estimates vary by over one order of magnitude. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, more accurate estimates are now possible. We sequenced 19 Escherichia coli genomes from a 40,000-generation evolution experiment and directly inferred the point-mutation rate based on the accumulation of synonymous substitutions. The resulting estimate was 8.9 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9211 per base-pair per generation, and there was a significant bias toward increased AT-content. We also compared our results with published genome sequence datasets for other bacterial evolution experiments. Given the power of our approach, our estimate represents the most accurate measure of bacterial base-substitution rates available to date.Mutations and genetic recombination provide the variation that fuels adaptation. Knowledge of mutation rates is therefore an important component of a quantitative evolutionary theory (Lynch 2010). In bacteria, spontaneous base-substitution rates have been estimated by Luria-Delbr\xc3\xbcck fluctuation tests using selective conditions (Drake 1991; Lynch 2006, 2010 and references therein) and by comparing DNA sequences from lineages with approximately known divergence times (Ochman et al. 1999). Both methods have limitations. The former requires knowledge of the mutational target size for the relevant phenotype and makes assumptions concerning growth and selection that do not always hold in practice (Sniegowski and Lenski 1995). The latter assumes that synonymous substitutions are selectively neutral, requires estimates of generation times in nature, and is subject to additional uncertainty when there is recombination or selection on codon usage and GC-content (Balbi et al. 2009; Sharp et al. 2010; Touchon et al. 2009). Given these uncertainties, it is not surprising that the mutation rates estimated for E. coli using these two approaches differ by more than an order of magnitude (Drake 1991; Ochman et al. 1999). More direct measurements of mutation rates are now possible using whole-genome sequences of isolates sampled from evolution experiments. We have previously applied this approach to one population from the long-term evolution experiment with E. coli (Barrick et al. 2009; Barrick and Lenski 2009) in which 12 populations have been propagated independently for over 40,000 generations (Lenski 2004; Philippe et al. 2007). Here, we resequenced genomes of 19 clones that were sampled from 8 populations (Table 1 and supporting information, Table S1) that did not evolve elevated mutation rates early in the experiment (Cooper and Lenski 2000; Sniegowski et al. 1997).'","b'The quantification of spontaneous mutation rates is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of the evolutionary process. In bacteria, traditional estimates using experimental or comparative genetic methods are prone to statistical uncertainty and consequently estimates vary by over one order of magnitude. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, more accurate estimates are now possible. We sequenced 19 Escherichia coli genomes from a 40,000-generation evolution experiment and directly inferred the point-mutation rate based on the accumulation of synonymous substitutions. The resulting estimate was 8.9 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9211 per base-pair per generation, and there was a significant bias toward increased AT-content. We also compared our results with published genome sequence datasets for other bacterial evolution experiments. Given the power of our approach, our estimate represents the most accurate measure of bacterial base-substitution rates available to date. Mutations and genetic recombination provide the variation that fuels adaptation. Knowledge of mutation rates is therefore an important component of a quantitative evolutionary theory (Lynch 2010). In bacteria, spontaneous base-substitution rates have been estimated by Luria-Delbr\xc3\xbcck fluctuation tests using selective conditions (Drake 1991; Lynch 2006, 2010 and references therein) and by comparing DNA sequences from lineages with approximately known divergence times (Ochman et al. 1999). Both methods have limitations. The former requires knowledge of the mutational target size for the relevant phenotype and makes assumptions concerning growth and selection that do not always hold in practice (Sniegowski and Lenski 1995). The latter assumes that synonymous substitutions are selectively neutral, requires estimates of generation times in nature, and is subject to additional uncertainty when there is recombination or selection on codon usage and GC-content (Balbi et al. 2009; Sharp et al. 2010; Touchon et al. 2009). Given these uncertainties, it is not surprising that the mutation rates estimated for E. coli using these two approaches differ by more than an order of magnitude (Drake 1991; Ochman et al. 1999). More direct measurements of mutation rates are now possible using whole-genome sequences of isolates sampled from evolution experiments. We have previously applied this approach to one population from the long-term evolution experiment with E. coli (Barrick et al. 2009; Barrick and Lenski 2009) in which 12 populations have been propagated independently for over 40,000 generations (Lenski 2004; Philippe et al. 2007). Here, we resequenced genomes of 19 clones that were sampled from 8 populations (Table 1 and supporting information, Table S1) that did not evolve elevated mutation rates early in the experiment (Cooper and Lenski 2000; Sniegowski et al. 1997). Genomes were resequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer platform using one lane of single-end 36-bp reads per genome. Candidate point mutations were identified in comparison to the ancestral genome of REL606 [GenBank:NC_012967.1] using three computational approaches: (i) the SNiPer pipeline (Marchetti et al. 2010); (ii) the breseq pipeline (Barrick et al. 2009, freely available online at http://barricklab.org/breseq); and (iii) an unpublished algorithm (O. Tenaillon). All candidates were then examined manually to account for local misalignment errors relative to the reference genome that resulted from gene conversion events, mobile element insertions, and large insertions and deletions. Table S1 presents the resulting consensus list of all synonymous substitutions arranged by population and clone. The dN/dS ratios were calculated for each clone according to Comeron (1995) as implemented in the libsequence library (Thornton 2003). For whole-genome studies of mutations in bacterial evolution experiments, we used in-house scripts to calculate the exact number of protein-coding sites in the ancestral genome according to gene annotations. The effective number of synonymous target sites was approximated as one-third of this number, as three mutational changes are possible from any ancestral base. This analysis does not take into account base composition effects or the small changes in genome size during these experiments. The sequence records used for other published studies were downloaded from Genbank (Accessions: NC_000913.2,  AC_000091.1, NC_008095.1, and NC_003197.1). For our dataset, we used the Genbank sequence record for E. coli B strain REL606 (Accession: NC_012967.1) with updated gene annotations. Data files and Perl scripts for performing this analysis are available on J.E.B.\xe2\x80\x99s web site (http://barricklab.org/amr). We used a maximum-likelihood approach to estimate the rates of all six possible types of base-pair substitution mutations. This approach assumed that synonymous substitutions of a given type accumulated as a Poisson process with an expected number equal to the mutation rate multiplied by the number of generations elapsed and the total number of genomic sites at risk for synonymous substitutions of that type. This last factor corrected for regions of the ancestral genome where mutations could not be called in an evolved genome due to deletions, low coverage, or repetitive sequences, as output by the breseq pipeline. We corrected for pseudo-replication due to shared evolutionary history by averaging the calculated log likelihoods for genomes within population blocks. The overall point-mutation rate was then calculated by weighting the separately estimated rates for each type of mutation by the frequency of corresponding sites in the ancestral genome. Tukey\xe2\x80\x99s jackknife method was used to estimate overall confidence limits from the statistics of resampled (delete\xe2\x80\x931) datasets that each dropped all genomes from a single population. Data files and Perl and R scripts for performing this analysis are available on J.E.B.\xe2\x80\x99s web site (http://barricklab.org/amr). We analyzed synonymous substitutions because, when examining all mutations in the 19 clones, we found dN/dS ratios higher than 1.0 for all but one (Table S1). This observation supports pervasive ongoing positive selection through 40,000 generations in these experimental populations (Barrick et al. 2009). Therefore, non-synonymous mutations are inappropriate for estimating the point-mutation rate. From population genetics theory, the expected number of synonymous mutations in an evolved clone relative to its ancestor is equal to the product of the intrinsic base-substitution rate, the number of genomic sites at risk for synonymous mutations, and the number of elapsed generations (Kimura 1983). The only requisite assumption is that most synonymous mutations are selectively neutral. Importantly, the expected rate of accumulation of neutral mutations in the lineage leading to any particular clone is not affected by selection at other sites in the genome, because an asexual lineage simply represents a chain of replication events spanning the specified number of generations (Barrick et al. 2009; Kimura 1983). We observed a total of 52 synonymous substitutions in the 19 resequenced genomes (Table S1). However, multiple genomes sampled from the same population are not independent because they share some portion of their history; thus, there were only 35 mutational events (Table 1). We used a resampling procedure to account for this pseudo-replication of multiple genomes isolated from a single population (see supporting information). The resulting estimate of the point-mutation rate is 8.9 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9211 per bp per generation (Tukey\xe2\x80\x99s jackknife 95% confidence interval, 4.0\xe2\x80\x9314 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9211 per bp per generation). This estimate corresponds to a total genomic rate of 0.00041 per generation given the ancestral genome size of 4.6 \xc3\x97 106 bp. Our inferred point-mutation rate is intermediate to other previous estimates based on experimental (Drake 1991) and comparative methods (Ochman et al. 1999). These earlier studies yielded estimates of 5.4 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9210 per bp per generation and 1.5 to 4.5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9211 per bp per generation, respectively. Given the limitations of these approaches as noted above, our estimate is probably more accurate. This greater accuracy derives from the accumulation of mutational events across 300,000 generations (summed over the eight replicate populations) and over the entire genome, coupled with precise knowledge of the number of elapsed generations and the reasonable presumption of selective neutrality or near-neutrality for most synonymous mutations. At the same time, it must also be emphasized that mutation rates may differ between strains and species, and they may change depending on the environmental conditions experienced by the cells (Bjedov et al. 2003). To put our estimate into context, we performed a similar analysis of all other published whole-genome datasets for bacterial evolution experiments with known numbers of generations (Table 2). Taking the other experiments together, we found 10 synonymous SNPs in 18 independently evolved (nonmutator) clones in a total of 30,550 generations. These other datasets combined thus provide only \xe2\x88\xbc10% of the power, in terms of cumulative generations, as the long-term dataset that we have generated and analyzed. As a consequence, the estimated point-mutation rates for these other experimental systems are subject to much greater statistical uncertainty. With 35 independent synonymous mutations, we were also able to examine the mutational spectrum of base substitutions (Figure 1). After correcting for the sequence composition of genomic sites at risk for synonymous mutations in the ancestral genome, the observed transition-to-transversion ratio of 1:1.99 did not differ significantly from the 1:2 ratio expected if there were a uniform probability of all six base-substitution mutations (two-tailed binomial test, P = 0.61). However, transitions were highly skewed. Mutations from C:G to T:A were 14.5 times as likely as A:T to G:C mutations after accounting for sequence composition (two-tailed binomial test, P = 0.00027). This finding is consistent with other recent studies that found a strong mutational bias toward increased AT composition in bacteria (Balbi et al. 2009; Hershberg and Petrov 2010; Hildebrand et al. 2010). This bias in mutation pressure explains the pattern of synonymous mutations seen in our study, and it also implies that selection or gene conversion must account for the characteristic GC-contents observed in divergent groups of bacteria over much longer evolutionary timescales (Rocha and Feil 2010). Expected and observed mutational spectra for synonymous point mutations. White and black bars show the expected and observed base-pair changes, respectively. The expected values reflect the actual base-pair frequencies in the genome and the probability that a particular base-pair mutation (e.g., from C:G to T:A) produces a synonymous change.

In this study, a set of 73 introgression lines (S42ILs) originating from a cross between the spring barley cultivar Scarlett (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) and the wild barley accession ISR42-8 (H. v. ssp. spontaneum) was subjected to high-resolution genotyping with an Illumina 1536-SNP array. The array enabled a precise localization of the wild barley introgressions in the elite barley background. Based on 636 informative SNPs, the S42IL set represents 87.3% of the wild barley genome, where each line contains on average 3.3% of the donor genome. Furthermore, segregating high-resolution mapping populations (S42IL-HRs) were developed for 70 S42ILs in order to facilitate QTL fine-mapping and cloning. As a case study, we used the developed genetic resources to rapidly identify and fine-map the novel locus thresh-1 on chromosome 1H that controls grain threshability. Here, the recessive wild barley allele confers a difficult to thresh phenotype, suggesting that thresh-1 played an important role during barley domestication. Using a S42IL-HR population, thresh-1 was fine-mapped within a 4.3cM interval that was predicted to contain candidate genes involved in regulation of plant cell wall composition. The set of wild barley introgression lines and derived high-resolution populations are ideal tools to speed up the process of mapping and further dissecting QTL, which ultimately clears the way for isolating the genes behind QTL effects.As demonstrated in various crop species, introgression lines (ILs) are a valuable genetic resource for the identification of QTL for important agronomic traits (e.g., Eshed and Zamir 1995; Faris and Gill 2002; Liu et al. 2006; Mei et al. 2006; Simons et al. 2006; Uauy et al. 2006; Szalma et al. 2007; Falke et al. 2008; Fu et al. 2009). An IL set represents the genome of a donor parent through single lines each carrying one or few introgressed donor segments in the same genetic background of the recurrent parent. This is achieved by several rounds of backcrossing to the recurrent parent followed by marker-assisted selection (Zamir 2001). Compared with traditional mapping populations such as recombinant inbred lines (RILs), ILs offer increased statistical power to detect small QTL effects due to the removal of confounding segregating alleles at background genomic regions (Law 1966; Keurentjes et al. 2007). As a result, complex traits, controlled by several unlinked genes, can be broken down into simple Mendelian factors (Deng et al. 2011). In addition, because only small genetic regions are introgressed, favorable alleles from exotic species can be incorporated, exhibiting no or only a limited number of additional unfavorable effects that might cosegregate as linkage drag. All in all, these factors make ILs a useful base to embark on fine-mapping and cloning of important QTL. ILs developed in tomato have been used extensively to map QTL controlling complex quantitative traits including fruit weight, sugar content, and plant size (Alpert and Tanksley 1996; Eshed and Zamir 1995). In barley, a subset of near isogenic lines were developed for fine-mapping a locus controlling leaf rust (Marcel et al. 2007). QTL controlling grain weight (R\xc3\xb6der et al. 2008) and the number of grains per ear (Wang et al. 2010a) were fine-mapped in wheat using ILs. Additionally in tomato, segregating populations derived from ILs containing QTL facilitated the cloning of genes controlling fruit size (Frary et al. 2000) and fruit sugar content (Fridman et al. 2004). A dense genetic map which allows for localizing the introgressed segments with high resolution is crucial for the selection of ILs containing only a small portion of the introgressed genome. So far, the majority of IL sets has been developed and applied for QTL mapping based on a relatively low number of markers that have been generated from anonymous genomic regions (e.g., simple sequence repeats, restriction fragment length polymorphisms). Currently, gene-based molecular markers originating from cDNAs/ESTs (expressed sequenced tags) have gained importance in plant genetics and genomics-assisted breeding (e.g., Kota et al. 2008; Deleu et al. 2009; Varshney et al. 2009; Chin et al. 2010). Here, EST\xe2\x80\x93single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are especially useful due to their high abundance and adaptability to high-throughput, low-cost genotyping assays. Markers derived from ESTs allow for detecting polymorphisms within protein-coding transcribed genes and thus may facilitate gene isolation via map-based cloning or comparative genomics (Stein et al. 2007; Hackauf et al. 2009; Muchero et al. 2011). In barley (Hordeum vulgare), Close et al. (2009) identified a significant number of genic SNPs from ESTs and sequenced PCR amplicons and used them to develop two Illumina barley oligo pool assays (BOPA1 and BOPA2), each enabling the simultaneous genotyping of 1536 SNPs. Furthermore, a barley consensus genetic map comprising 2943 SNPs has been created from linkage maps of four reference populations (Close et al. 2009). The advantage of these resources has been proven by diverse association mapping studies (Rostoks et al. 2006; Cockram et al. 2010; Comadran et al. 2011; Lorenz et al. 2010). So far, two collections of backcross-derived barley lines have been developed and characterized using the Illumina genotyping arrays and the above described consensus map. Druka et al. (2011) constructed a set of near isogenic lines carrying mutant alleles for most of the morphological and developmental variation in barley. Sato and Takeda (2009) reported on the characterization of a set of recombinant chromosome substitution lines, each containing a small portion of a wild barley accession introgressed into the genetic background of an elite parent. Both populations are proposed as valuable resources for identifying genes underlying simple and quantitative traits. Such populations might also be helpful to shed further light on genes which were selected during domestication. In barley domestication-related genes like brittleness, spike row-type, flowering time control under photoperiod and vernalization signals are already mapped or cloned (Azhacuvel et al. 2006; Komatsuda et al. 2007; Ramsay et al. 2011; Turner et al. 2005; Yan et al. 2004, 2005, 2006). Further genes that control important domestication traits like grain size, grain yield or threshability of grains are still awaiting molecular discovery. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the previously selected barley S42IL population, originating from the cross Scarlett (H. vulgare ssp. vulgare, hereafter abbreviated Hv) \xc3\x97 ISR42-8 (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum, hereafter abbreviated Hsp) (Schmalenbach et al. 2008) by genotyping with the Illumina BOPA1 array (Close et al. 2009). In addition, we intended to further develop the S42ILs into a resource for rapid identification, fine-mapping, and positional cloning of QTL. Besides a dense genetic map, the major requirement for these applications is the development of large populations with sufficient recombination events in the target QTL region. In order to increase the recombination events within the target QTL interval, we developed for most introgression lines a high-resolution mapping population (S42IL-HR) segregating within the introgressed region.

A set of 73 wild barley introgression lines (hereafter referred to as S42ILs) was subjected to high-throughput genotyping with the Illumina GoldenGate assay. The S42ILs are derived from a cross between the German malting barley cultivar Scarlett and the Israeli wild barley accession ISR 42-8. As reported in Von Korff et al. (2004), the initial cross was backcrossed twice to produce the advanced backcross doubled haploid population S42 consisting of 301 BC2DH lines. The S42ILs were generated based on 40 lines selected from that population (Von Korff et al. 2004). Here, a strategy combining one further round of backcrossing, two to four selfings and marker-assisted selection with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was applied (Figure 1). The development of 59 S42ILs (S42ILs-101 to -157, -175, and -176) as well as their initial genetic characterization with altogether 98 SSR markers is described in detail in Schmalenbach et al. (2008). Since then, 14 new lines (S42ILs-158 to -164, -166 to -171, and -173) were selected following the same strategy as described above (Figure 1). Based on the initial SSR genotype data, each single line contained one or two chromosomal segments of the exotic parent ISR 42-8 (Hsp) within the genetic background of the elite parent Scarlett (Hv) (Schmalenbach et al. 2008). The genotyping of the 73 S42ILs with the Illumina GoldenGate assay was carried out with BC3S6 plants which originate from a single BC3S4 line (S42IL). Strategy for developing introgressions lines and high-resolution mapping populations from the wild barley cross Scarlett \xc3\x97 ISR42-8. In order to select a set of introgression lines (S42ILs), a strategy combining backcrossing, repeated selfing, and marker-assisted selection (MAS) was applied. In the BC2S4:6 generation, the S42ILs have been characterized precisely on the genotype level using Illumina SNPs as described in the present study. Additionally, phenotype data were assessed for a subset of 39 S42ILs in order to validate QTL effects detected in the parental population S42 (Schmalenbach et al. 2008; Schmalenbach et al. 2009; Schmalenbach and Pillen 2009). High-resolution mapping populations (S42IL-HR) were finally developed by backcrossing the S42ILs with the recurrent parent followed by two selfings. They are available for future fine-mapping and cloning of interesting genes. To enable fine-mapping and map-based cloning of interesting phenotypes, high-resolution mapping populations derived from the S42ILs were generated through one further round of backcrossing with Scarlett and two consecutive rounds of selfing (Figure 1). For backcrossing, one to five S42IL plants in BC3S6 were randomly chosen to produce BC4S0 seeds. For selfings, at least 6 BC4S0 seeds and, respectively, 100 BC4S1 seeds were randomly chosen to reduce the risk of selection or drift effects present in the resulting BC4S2 HR populations. For DNA isolation, 30-50 mg leaf material of 2-week-old seedlings grown in the greenhouse was harvested for each S42IL. Per line, leaf material from on average 12 BC3S6 plants was pooled. After adding 400 \xc2\xb5l RLT buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), the material was homogenized using a TissueLyser bead mill (Qiagen) and extracted using the BioSprint DNA Plant Kit and the BioSprint 96 workstation from Qiagen. Isolated DNA was disolved in distilled water, and, based on agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA concentration of all samples was assessed. If required, samples were concentrated using a Savant SpeedVac concentrator (GMI) to achieve a final concentration of about 100 ng/\xc2\xb5l. For Illumina SNP genotyping, a sample volume of 25 \xc2\xb5l was provided. DNA samples were submitted to the Southern California Genotyping Consortium (SCGC), Illumina BeadLab at the University of California, Los Angeles (http://scgc.genetics.ucla.edu/) and genotyped with the 1536-SNP barley BOPA1 set (Close et al. 2009). Forty-one S42ILs (S42IL-101 to -139, -149, and -150) were genotyped in two technical replications and the remaining 32 lines in one replication. In addition, the parents Scarlett and ISR42-8 were analyzed in four replicates each. Obtained raw data were transformed to genotype calls and subsequently manually supervised to correct for excessive emphasis on heterozygote calls using GenCall software (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at the Close lab (University of California, Riverside, CA). Only the most reliable calls were retained. All SNPs, which had no genotype or map data, were nonpolymorphic between the parents, or showed ambiguous and nonreproducible genotypes, were discarded. The informative SNPs used for characterizing the S42ILs are designated by BOPA1 numbers (Close et al. 2009). Detailed information such as the according HarvEST unigene assembly #32 numbers is given in supporting information, Table S1. The genetic order of all markers was taken from the Close et al. (2009) consensus map which included 2943 SNP loci. Based on their graphical genotypes, obtained using the Graphical GenoTypes (GGT) software (Van Berloo 1999), the S42ILs where ordered according to the chromosomal positions of their overlapping target introgressions (Figure 2 and Table S1). The size of the target introgression was calculated for each line, where the half-intervals flanking a marker locus were assumed to be of the same genotype. For calculating the portion of Hsp genome per S42IL, a total genome size of 1576 cM was assumed, based on Close et al. (2009) (see Table S1). Graphical genotypes of 73 Hsp introgression lines (S42ILs). The 73 S42ILs, presented vertically, have been characterized with 636 Illumina SNPs, shown horizontally. The order of the S42ILs is in accordance with Table 1, and the marker order is taken from the consensus map of Close et al. (2009). Each S42IL carries one or several homozygous or heterozygous wild barley introgressions (depicted in black and dark gray, respectively) in the genetic background of the elite parent (in light gray). Missing marker data are indicated in white. To evaluate grain threshability (see Figure 3) a subset of 49 S42ILs (S42IL-101 to -144, -146 to -149, and -153) and Scarlett as the control genotype were evaluated in two independent glasshouse experiments. Each experiment consisted of three completely randomized blocks. Ten plants of each genotype were grown in 1.5 L pots filled with a cultivation substrate containing peat, clay, and NPK fertilizer with 250, 300, and 400 mg/L nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium, respectively, pH 5.8. Plants were grown under 14/10-hr day/night photoperiod with a daily temperature range of 15\xc2\xb0C to 22\xc2\xb0C. At maturity grain spikes were collected and threshed using a rotating home-made threshing drum. The rotational speed of the threshing drum and duration of threshing was adjusted so that grains from Scarlett were completely removed from the spike rachis and the awns were detached from the grain. Threshability was scored as a qualitative trait, where a genotype was considered difficult to thresh if parts of the awns and/or the rachis remained attached to the grain after the outlined threshing procedure (Figure 3). Based on the results of this initial experiment, 91 individual seeds from the high resolution mapping population S42IL-143HR were selected depending on their threshability phenotype. The selected HR individuals were grown, along with S42IL-143 and Scarlett as controls, in a second experiment under the same glasshouse conditions as stated above and phenotyped for threshability to enable fine-mapping of the grain threshability locus. Phenotypes of the thresh-1 gene after mechanical threshing. Left image: Difficult to thresh grains from line S42IL-143, homozygous for the recessive Hsp allele thresh-1 where parts of the awns and the rachis remain attached to the grain. Right image: Easy to thresh grains from cultivar Scarlett, homozygous for the dominant Hv allele Thresh-1 without remnants from awns and rachis. For genotyping of the S42IL-143HR population, the Illumina BOPA1 markers were converted to either cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) or pyrosequencing markers as described previously (Wang et al. 2010b). Primer information is detailed in Table S2. In total nine BOPA1 markers were converted to genotype Hsp introgressions on chromosomes 1H, 5H, 6H, and 7H. In addition, the SSR marker HvABAIP, which was originally used to select the line S42IL-143 (Schmalenbach et al. 2008), along with the CAPS marker HvFT3 previously shown to map within the 1H introgression of S42IL-143 (Wang et al. 2010b) were also used for genotyping. Genetic distances between the markers were calculated with the Kosambi mapping function in JoinMap v.3.0 (Kyazma B.V, Wageningen, The Netherlands) and graphical genotypes were visualized with the GGT software (Van Berloo 1999). The previously published virtual gene order of barley chromosome 1H (Mayer et al. 2009) was used to predict the genes located in the thresh-1 region. The SSR marker HvABAIP (GenBank accession X13498) was positioned into the chromosome 1H gene order scaffold by performing a blastx search against the rice genome sequence to identify the orthologous gene position in rice (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). A set of 73 wild barley introgression lines was genotyped with high resolution using the Illumina GoldenGate assay. Out of 1536 BOPA1 SNPs, 1148 markers gave useful genotype information in the S42IL set. Of these, a total of 636 SNPs (55.4%) were polymorphic between Scarlett and ISR42-8 and were finally used for characterizing the S42ILs. The average marker density varied from 1.9 cM for chromosome 2H (228 cM/120 SNPs) to 3.1 cM for chromosome 7H (230 cM/75 SNPs). Overall, 87.3% of the Hsp genome (1376 out of 1576 cM) is represented by, in most cases overlapping, target Hsp introgressions in the Hv genetic background (Figure 2). Wild barley chromosomes 1H, 4H, 6H, and 7H are completely represented, whereas the lowest genome coverage was estimated for 5H (63.3%). The biggest gaps where no lines are developed yet were detected on top of chromosomes 5H and 3H with 98.4 cM and 49.6 cM, respectively. A number of lines carry a second nontarget Hsp segment that covers a chromosomal region not represented by primary introgressions in the complete set of lines. An example is S42IL-114 possessing the target introgression on chromosome 3H plus an additional segment on chromosome 5H, which has a size of 14.4 cM (see Table S1). Taking into account these additional introgressions, the total Hsp genome coverage of the S42IL set increases to 89.5%. As shown in Table 1, 20 S42ILs carry a single introgression (i.e., only the target one), 22 lines contain one additional homozygous or heterozygous Hsp segment, and 31 lines exhibit two to four secondary introgressions. Three target segments are represented by two lines simultaneously (i.e., S42IL-118 and -120, and -119 and -120 on chromosome 4H, and -149 and -152 on chromosome 6H). The target introgressions possess an average size of 42.9 cM, ranging from 5.7 cM in S42IL-110 to 109.7 cM in S42IL-114 (Table 1). Taking into account all homozygous introgressions, on average 3.3% of the wild barley genome is represented per line, varying from 0.8% in S42IL-170 to 8.4% represented by four independent introgressions in S42IL-156. Furthermore, 38 lines exhibited heterozygosity at one or more SNP loci. A core set of 32 S42ILs that represents the minimum number of lines required to cover the Hsp genome was selected (Table 1). Here, preferably lines with overlapping introgressions were picked to ensure a maximum coverage of the donor genome. The remaining 41 S42ILs are partial duplicates with shorter introgressions that can be useful for fine-mapping of markers and QTL. After backcrossing the S42ILs with Scarlett and two further rounds of selfing, a library of 70 high-resolution populations (S42IL-HR) in BC4S2 generation was developed (Table 1). Each HR population includes between 17 and 2096 grams of seed, segregating for markers and genes that are located within the introgression of the original S42IL. Assuming an average thousand grain weight of 40 g (Schmalenbach et al. 2009), these values correspond to a range from 425 to 52,400 segregating BC4S2 individuals per HR population. So far, 42 HR populations consist of at least 400 g of seed (i.e., \xe2\x89\xa510,000 individuals). Fourteen HR populations are currently multiplied again in the field, as indicated in Table 1. A first application of a HR population is shown by the following mapping of the thresh-1 locus. From 49 examined S42ILs, only line S42IL-143 was found to show reduced grain threshability compared with the control genotype Scarlett. After mechanical threshing, rachis and awns of line S42IL-143 were only partially removed from the grains. Line S42IL-143 was therefore classified as difficult to thresh (Figure 3). The BOPA1 genotype data showed that S42IL-143 possess a major Hsp introgression on the long arm of chromosome 1H (51.8 cM) plus four additional Hsp introgressions on chromosomes 5H (3.2 cM and 7.0 cM), 6H (28.9 cM), and 7H (4.7 cM). The additional introgressions on chromosomes 5H, 6H, and 7H were also represented by other S42ILs that did not show the difficult to thresh phenotype, thus it was assumed that the thresh-1 gene is located within the chromosome 1H introgression. The location of thresh-1 on chromosome 1H was further confirmed by phenotyping threshability of 91 plants of the high-resolution mapping population S42IL-143HR. Simultaneously, the same plants were genotyped with converted BOPA1 markers (Table S2) from all four introgressions of S42IL-143. The genotyping confirmed the presence of the additional Hsp introgressions on 5H, 6H, and 7H in S42IL-143. The phenotyping, however, proved that these loci were not genetically linked to the thresh-1 locus. In contrast, recombinants identified within the 1H Hsp introgression allowed to map the thresh-1 gene within a 4.3-cM interval between markers 1_0357 and HvABAIP (Figure 4). From 91 HR individuals phenotyped, 38 were easy to thresh and 53 were difficult to thresh. However, this segregation ratio was greatly distorted due to the individual selection of seeds, resulting in an overrepresentation of difficult to thresh genotypes. To clarify the mode of inheritance, four HR lines (#2, 19, 88, 89 in Figure 4) that proved to be heterozygous for the thresh-1 interval between markers 1_0357 and HvABAIP were used for progeny validation. From a total of 88 progeny (i.e., 22 offspring plants from each heterozygous HR plant), 61 were easy to thresh and 27 were difficult to thresh. This was not significantly different from a 3:1 segregation ratio (x2 = 1.151, P = 0.218) confirming that the Hv allele is dominant over the Hsp allele at the thresh-1 locus. Fine mapping the thresh-1 locus using the high resolution mapping population S42IL-143HR. (A) Screening 49 S42ILs localized the thresh-1 gene to an Hsp introgression on chromosome 1H, which is present in line S42IL-143. (B) Graphical genotypes showing informative recombinants, identified among 91 BC4S2 individuals of the S42IL-143HR population, that were used to delimitate the thresh-1 interval based on their threshability phenotype. Lines with missing or ambiguous genotype data were excluded. The numbers below the graphical genotypes refer to the HR line depicted, while the numbers in brackets refer the total number of individuals identified with the same graphical genotype. Progeny tests from HR lines 2, 19, 88, and 89 proved that the elite (Hv) allele Thresh-1 is dominant over the exotic (Hsp) allele thresh-1. The previously published virtual gene order of barley chromosome 1H was used to predict the genes within the thresh-1 region (Mayer et al. 2009). Reciprocal blast searches identified the SSR marker HvABAIP (ABA inducible protein; (Pillen et al. 2000), which flanks the bottom of the thresh-1 locus, to be a putative ortholog of the rice gene Os05g0542500. This allowed anchoring HvABAIP to the chromosome 1H virtual gene order between BOPA1 markers 2_0780 and 2_0921. The BOPA1 marker 2_0267, which flanks the top of the thresh-1 locus, was already present in the virtual gene order, therefore enabling the thresh-1 interval to be located. Based on the virtual gene order for this region, which was derived from synteny with the rice and sorghum genomes, the interval containing the thresh-1 locus was predicted to contain 60 genes (see Table S3). Of particular interest regarding the threshability trait were the identification of cell wall\xe2\x80\x93related genes that encode a cellulose synthase-like family C protein and polygalacturonase. The Illumina BOPA1 assay was applied for characterizing a set of 73 Hsp introgression lines with high resolution. In total, 636 SNPs out of 1148 (55.4%) revealed polymorphic alleles between the recurrent parent Scarlett and the donor parent ISR42-8. This polymorphism rate is similar to the amount of polymorphic BOPA1 SNPs between the elite barley cultivar Haruna Nijo and the wild barley strain H602 (51%), reported by Sato and Takeda (2009). As described by Close et al. (2009), SNP frequency was clearly increased when including H602 in the genotype panel used to develop the BOPA1 assay. Nevertheless, polymorphism rates around 50% between Hv and Hsp genotypes appear to be relatively low. This might be attributed in part to the SNPs\xe2\x80\x99 origin from coding sequences. An ascertainment bias in favor of Hv alleles during the development of the ILLUMINA array might also contributed to the observed polymorphism rate (Moragues et al. 2010). The S42IL set is an immortal genetic resource that represents most of the parental wild barley genome, where each single line contains only a small proportion of the Hsp donor genome. Initially, the set was developed and characterized with 98 SSR markers (Schmalenbach et al. 2008). Based on the SSR data, each line was assumed to contain only a single homozygous Hsp introgression in the genetic background of the elite parent. Genotyping the S42-ILs with the BOPA1 SNPs resulted in an increased mapping precision of the introgressed segments. This, in turn, revealed the existence of additional nontarget introgressions in S42ILs, which had not been detected previously. So far, eight randomly chosen S42ILs were regenotyped with 25 informative pyrosequencing markers in order to verify these secondary introgressions. The latter were derived from original Illumina SNPs (Table S2). The original Illumina assays of these markers had detected 28 Hsp introgressions among the eight S42ILs. Through pyrosequencing, the genotype of all 28 Hsp introgressions could be verified as homozygous Hsp or heterozygous Hv/Hsp (data not shown). The complete validation of all tested BOPA1 genotypes demonstrates the high accuracy of the Illumina GoldenGate assay. Pure S42ILs carrying only the target segments are advantageous as they enable the localization of a genetic effect (e.g., QTL) to a specific chromosomal interval. For this reason, the selection of pure introgression lines from the existing S42IL-HR populations is currently in progress. Nevertheless, S42ILs with overlapping introgressions are also useful for validating and confining the genetic localization of a phenotypic effect as shown in previous S42IL studies on pathogen resistances, yield and its agronomic components, malting quality and flowering time control (Schmalenbach et al. 2008; Schmalenbach et al. 2009; Schmalenbach and Pillen 2009; Wang et al. 2010b). In addition, we are currently investigating variation in the S42ILs for traits like mineral nutrient content, nitrogen deficiency tolerance, drought tolerance and others. Based on the Illumina genotypes, we selected a core set of 32 S42ILs which represents the minimum number of lines required to achieve the Hsp genome coverage of the complete set. Such a core set is beneficial for an initial low-resolution genome-wide QTL screening, whereas additional lines carrying smaller introgressions can be used subsequently for QTL fine-mapping (Fridman et al. 2004; Keurentjes et al. 2007). The present set of S42ILs includes two large gaps of Hsp introgressions on chromosomes 5H and 3H. We assume that these gaps occurred by chance in our S42IL set due to the limited number of backcross lines we started with. We neither conducted a selection of phenotypes nor did we observe a reduced viability of plants during IL development. To achieve a complete donor genome coverage, we are currently selecting lines from BC3 and BC4 progenies of a pool of potential S42ILs. The present and other studies demonstrate the usefulness of the Illumina GoldenGate assay for developing precisely characterized advanced backcross populations (Sato and Takeda 2009; Druka et al. 2011). Because barley genome sequencing is still in progress (Schulte et al. 2009), these populations are proposed as a key tool for high-resolution mapping of QTL and Mendelian loci and subsequent identification of the causal genes. The development of a library of HR populations for most of the original S42ILs will foster both map-based cloning and the transfer of interesting exotic genes that exhibit strong and/or favorable effects in the elite barley background. By means of the new HR populations, map-based cloning of QTL seems feasible since the available SNP data of S42ILs and the corresponding QTL data for pathogen resistances, yield-related traits and malting quality traits (Schmalenbach et al. 2008; Schmalenbach et al. 2009; Schmalenbach and Pillen 2009) can be used to directly select the appropriate S42IL-HR population from the HR library. The available number of up to 52,000 seeds for each HR population can thus be used to rapidly select recombination events in close vicinity to the target gene, allowing the genetic separation of tightly linked markers/genes from the target gene. Within the S42IL population we identified the thresh-1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 1H, where only line S42IL-143 carried the Hsp allele at the thresh-1 locus. The Hsp thresh-1 homozygous phenotype showed increased rachis and awn strength, which prevented them from breaking during normal mechanical threshing. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of such a phenotype in barley. The most well-studied grain threshing trait in barley is the brittle-rachis phenotype, where the grain spikes shatter upon applying slight mechanical force. The brittle-rachis phenotype is controlled by two tightly linked genes, Btr1 and Btr2, located on chromosome 3H (Takahashi and Hayashi 1964). Therefore, based on the phenotypic and genetic differences, we concluded that thresh-1 and Btr1/Btr2 are unrelated. During domestication of barley, the Btr1/Btr2 genes were selected against by early farmers to prevent seed loss before harvesting. Similar findings hold true for wheat domestication where, over time, early farmers selected at independent loci the alleles br, tg, sog, and Q to control brittleness, glume tenacity, glume softness, and threshability of wheat spikes (Sood et al. 2009). It is likely that early farmers also selected against the thresh-1 allele to facilitate easier harvesting. It remains open what evolutionary advantage the exotic thresh-1 allele provided prior to domestication. The remaining of the awns or parts thereof with the grain might have increased the chances of long distance seed dispersal through animals. After map-based isolation of the thresh-1 allele, further studies analyzing its allele frequency in wild barley populations might help to better understand the evolutionary history of this gene. We were rapidly able to reduce the thresh-1 locus to an interval of 4.3 cM by utilizing the S42IL-143HR high resolution mapping population, in combination with genotyping of polymorphic BOPA1 SNP markers for the target region. Furthermore, we could take advantage of the recent low-coverage sequencing of barley chromosome 1H and subsequent gene order prediction (Mayer et al. 2009) to identify candidate genes located in the thresh-1 interval. Based on the increased mechanical force required to remove the rachis and awns from the seeds we hypothesize that the thresh-1 gene is involved in altering the cell wall composition of the spike. In support of this hypothesis, the genomic thresh-1 region is predicted to contain at least two orthologous cell wall related genes from rice encoding for cellulose synthase-like family C (CSLC7) and polygalacturonase proteins. In barley, the CSLC gene family is known to comprise at least four members (CSLC1-4) with CSLC1 being orthologous to the rice CSLC7 gene (Dwivany et al. 2009). The CSLC1 has been mapped in barley to the long arm of chromosome 1H in the vicinity of the thresh-1 locus (Burton et al. 2010). The proposed function of the CSLC gene family in plants is to synthesize xyloglucan (Cocuron et al. 2007), which is a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

major component in strengthening cell walls. In contrast, polygalacturonase enzymes are involved in the degradation of pectin and subsequent weakening of the cell wall. In Arabidopsis, loss of function mutants for the polygalacturonase genes ADPG1 and ADPG2 caused the siliques not to shatter at maturity by preventing cells of the dehiscence zone from breaking apart (Ogawa et al. 2009). Based on this evidence, both CSCL1 and polygalacturonase are potential candidates for thresh-1. Further work is now under way to screen several thousand lines from the S42IL-143HR population to positionally clone and then functionally analyze the thresh-1 gene.

After this, a small fraction of cells can escape senescence, principally using recombination-dependent mechanisms. To investigate the pathways that affect entry into and recovery from telomere-driven senescence, we combined a gene deletion disrupting telomerase (est1\xce\x94) with the systematic yeast deletion collection and measured senescence characteristics in high-throughput assays. As expected, the vast majority of gene deletions showed no strong effects on entry into/exit from senescence. However, around 200 gene deletions behaving similarly to a rad52\xce\x94 est1\xce\x94 archetype (rad52\xce\x94 affects homologous recombination) accelerated entry into senescence, and such cells often could not recover growth. A smaller number of strains similar to a rif1\xce\x94 est1\xce\x94 archetype (rif1\xce\x94 affects proteins that bind telomeres) accelerated entry into senescence but also accelerated recovery from senescence. Our genome-wide analysis identifies genes that affect entry into and/or exit from telomere-initiated senescence and will be of interest to those studying telomere biology, replicative senescence, cancer, and ageing. Our dataset is complementary to other high-throughput studies relevant to telomere biology, genetic stability, and DNA damage responses.In most eukaryotes, including mammals and yeasts, telomerase helps maintain telomeric DNA and solve the chromosome end-replication problem (Gomes et al. 2010). Telomeric DNA recruits a number of different telomere-binding proteins to make functional telomeres. Dysfunctional telomeres can stimulate DNA damage responses, leading to genetic instability, cell senescence, or apoptosis (Jain and Cooper 2010; Lydall 2009; Stewart and Weinberg 2006). In most human somatic cells, there is insufficient telomerase to maintain telomere length indefinitely through cell divisions, and consequently, telomeres shorten and ultimately become nonfunctional. Telomere shortening is thought to be a double-edged sword in metazoan cells (Gomes et al. 2010; Stewart and Weinberg 2006). On one hand, the limited lifespan of functional telomeres limits cell divisions and therefore protects against uncontrolled cell division in cancer (Artandi and Depinho 2009; Lin et al. 2010). On the other hand, limiting cell division prevents tissue renewal and repair and thus contributes to ageing. Telomere structure and function need to be maintained in cells with unlimited proliferative potential. In the majority of cancers, structure and function are preserved via the expression of high levels of telomerase, permitting unlimited and uncontrolled cell division. However, in around 15% of cancers, telomeres are maintained by alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanisms (Henson et al. 2002). Therefore a fuller understanding of the pathways allowing eukaryotic cells to tolerate dysfunctional telomeres or to maintain functional telomeres, either in the presence or absence of telomerase, is critical for understanding processes underlying carcinogenesis and aging. In budding yeast, telomerase is constitutively expressed and telomere length is stable. However, telomerase can be deleted, giving yeast cells a life-cycle much like mammalian somatic cells; their telomeres shorten, they enter into a period of senescence/crisis, and at low rates, the cells recover from senescence using telomerase-independent mechanisms to maintain telomere length and function (Lundblad and Blackburn 1993). Telomerase-deficient yeast cells are therefore an excellent model system to study the pathways that allow eukaryotic cells to tolerate dysfunctional telomeres or to maintain telomeres in the absence of telomerase, and are thus useful for studying pathways relevant to human carcinogenesis. Telomerase-deficient yeast cells typically survive by using recombination-dependent mechanisms to maintain telomeres and are a model for ALT pathways in human cells (Lendvay et al. 1996; Lundblad and Blackburn 1993). However, recombination-independent mechanisms for chromosome end protection also occur in budding and fission yeasts (Jain et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2008; Maringele and Lydall 2004b). Although a number of yeast genes, principally genes affecting homologous recombination, have been identified that affect entry/exit from telomere driven senescence (Abdallah et al. 2009; Azam et al. 2006; Chang et al. 2011; Enomoto et al. 2002; Enomoto et al. 2004; Ijpma and Greider 2003; Le et al. 1999; Lee et al. 2007; Lydeard et al. 2007; Maringele and Lydall 2004a; Mceachern and Haber 2006), so far no genome-wide analysis of these processes has been reported. Here we describe the first genome-wide survey to systematically determine the effects of budding yeast gene deletions on the growth of cells with telomere defects. Through these systematic approaches in budding yeast, we identify many yeast genes that affect telomere-driven senescence, orthologs of which may play important roles during carcinogenesis or aging.'","b""In telomerase-deficient yeast cells, like equivalent mammalian cells, telomeres shorten over many generations until a period of senescence/crisis is reached. After this, a small fraction of cells can escape senescence, principally using recombination-dependent mechanisms. To investigate the pathways that affect entry into and recovery from telomere-driven senescence, we combined a gene deletion disrupting telomerase (est1\xce\x94) with the systematic yeast deletion collection and measured senescence characteristics in high-throughput assays. As expected, the vast majority of gene deletions showed no strong effects on entry into/exit from senescence. However, around 200 gene deletions behaving similarly to a rad52\xce\x94 est1\xce\x94 archetype (rad52\xce\x94 affects homologous recombination) accelerated entry into senescence, and such cells often could not recover growth. A smaller number of strains similar to a rif1\xce\x94 est1\xce\x94 archetype (rif1\xce\x94 affects proteins that bind telomeres) accelerated entry into senescence but also accelerated recovery from senescence. Our genome-wide analysis identifies genes that affect entry into and/or exit from telomere-initiated senescence and will be of interest to those studying telomere biology, replicative senescence, cancer, and ageing. Our dataset is complementary to other high-throughput studies relevant to telomere biology, genetic stability, and DNA damage responses. In most eukaryotes, including mammals and yeasts, telomerase helps maintain telomeric DNA and solve the chromosome end-replication problem (Gomes et al. 2010). Telomeric DNA recruits a number of different telomere-binding proteins to make functional telomeres. Dysfunctional telomeres can stimulate DNA damage responses, leading to genetic instability, cell senescence, or apoptosis (Jain and Cooper 2010; Lydall 2009; Stewart and Weinberg 2006). In most human somatic cells, there is insufficient telomerase to maintain telomere length indefinitely through cell divisions, and consequently, telomeres shorten and ultimately become nonfunctional. Telomere shortening is thought to be a double-edged sword in metazoan cells (Gomes et al. 2010; Stewart and Weinberg 2006). On one hand, the limited lifespan of functional telomeres limits cell divisions and therefore protects against uncontrolled cell division in cancer (Artandi and Depinho 2009; Lin et al. 2010). On the other hand, limiting cell division prevents tissue renewal and repair and thus contributes to ageing. Telomere structure and function need to be maintained in cells with unlimited proliferative potential. In the majority of cancers, structure and function are preserved via the expression of high levels of telomerase, permitting unlimited and uncontrolled cell division. However, in around 15% of cancers, telomeres are maintained by alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanisms (Henson et al. 2002). Therefore a fuller understanding of the pathways allowing eukaryotic cells to tolerate dysfunctional telomeres or to maintain functional telomeres, either in the presence or absence of telomerase, is critical for understanding processes underlying carcinogenesis and aging. In budding yeast, telomerase is constitutively expressed and telomere length is stable. However, telomerase can be deleted, giving yeast cells a life-cycle much like mammalian somatic cells; their telomeres shorten, they enter into a period of senescence/crisis, and at low rates, the cells recover from senescence using telomerase-independent mechanisms to maintain telomere length and function (Lundblad and Blackburn 1993). Telomerase-deficient yeast cells are therefore an excellent model system to study the pathways that allow eukaryotic cells to tolerate dysfunctional telomeres or to maintain telomeres in the absence of telomerase, and are thus useful for studying pathways relevant to human carcinogenesis. Telomerase-deficient yeast cells typically survive by using recombination-dependent mechanisms to maintain telomeres and are a model for ALT pathways in human cells (Lendvay et al. 1996; Lundblad and Blackburn 1993). However, recombination-independent mechanisms for chromosome end protection also occur in budding and fission yeasts (Jain et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2008; Maringele and Lydall 2004b). Although a number of yeast genes, principally genes affecting homologous recombination, have been identified that affect entry/exit from telomere driven senescence (Abdallah et al. 2009; Azam et al. 2006; Chang et al. 2011; Enomoto et al. 2002; Enomoto et al. 2004; Ijpma and Greider 2003; Le et al. 1999; Lee et al. 2007; Lydeard et al. 2007; Maringele and Lydall 2004a; Mceachern and Haber 2006), so far no genome-wide analysis of these processes has been reported. Here we describe the first genome-wide survey to systematically determine the effects of budding yeast gene deletions on the growth of cells with telomere defects. Through these systematic approaches in budding yeast, we identify many yeast genes that affect telomere-driven senescence, orthologs of which may play important roles during carcinogenesis or aging. An est1::natMX strain (DLY5026) was combined with the genome-wide knockout collection using SGA as previously described (Addinall et al. 2011). W303 genetic background strains were cultured in yeast extract, peptone, dextrose, and adenine (YEPD) media. 1536 colony solid agar-to-solid agar pinning was performed on a Biomatrix BM3-SC robot (S&P Robotics Inc., Toronto, Canada) using an 0.8 mm diameter pin tool. Selected est1::natMX yfg::G418 double mutants were cherry-picked after SGA. Inoculation from solid to liquid media was performed on the Biomatrix BM3-SC robot using a 96-pin (1 mm diameter) pintool. 96-well liquid culture plates were incubated at 30\xc2\xb0C for 22 hr without shaking. A Biomek FX robot (Beckman Coulter Limited, High Wycombe, UK) was used to vortex the cultures to resuspend and then inoculated into new sets of 96-well plates containing 200 \xc2\xb5l media in each well. A 96-pin (2 mm diameter) pin tool (V&P Scientific, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used, transferring approximately 3 \xc2\xb5l of cell culture at each passage. In a similar procedure, resuspended cell cultures were diluted in 200 \xc2\xb5l sterile H2O and vortexed before the diluted cultures were spotted onto solid agar plates. Agar plates were incubated for 48 hr at 30\xc2\xb0C before being photographed. Solid agar plates were photographed on an spImager (S&P Robotics Inc.) and analyzed using Colonyzer (Lawless et al. 2010). Culture size variances were stabilized using a Box-Cox transformation with a power parameter of 0.6 as implemented in the R statistical package (R Development Core Team 2011). The similarity of the MDP shape of each strain to that of three example archetypes was estimated using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between strain MDPs and the MDP of each archetype, using the cor function in the R statistical package (R Development Core Team 2011). As well as calculating r, absolute differences in MDP were estimated using the root mean square (RMS) difference between profiles. The area under each MDP (representing total strain fitness across all passages) was also estimated as the sum of mean culture size across all 22 passages. Lists ranking the MDP for each strain according to its correlation coefficient were generated, with the strains having MDP shape most similar to the archetype (and the archetype itself) at the top of the list (Figure 4, and supporting information, File S5, File S6, File S7, and File S8). Note that the absolute fitness of a comparator strain does not have to be similar to that of the archetype for their MDPs to correlate well. Two strains, one sick and one healthy, can have similarly shaped MDPs that correlate well. It is for this reason that some of the heat maps in Figure 4 are perceptibly stripy. Recovered fraction for each genotype was estimated by counting the number of repeated cultures for each strain and calculating the fraction of those repeats which had recovered to a size of 1000 or greater by passage 19 (typically in the range from 0/8 to 8/8). For classes similar to each of the three archetypes, the average recovered fraction of class members was calculated. Southern hybridization to examine telomere length and structure was performed similarly to that previously described (Maringele and Lydall 2004a). Genomic DNA was extracted, digested with XhoI, then run overnight on a 1% agarose gel at 1 V/cm. Southern transfer and detection was performed using DIG-High Prime Labeling and Detection Kit (Roche) and visualized on a FUJI LAS4000. Telomeric Y\xe2\x80\xb2-TG probes (pHT128; Tsubouchi and Ogawa 2000) were labelled using DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling and Detction Starter Kit II. To identify gene products that affect how telomerase-deficient cells enter into and recover from senescence, we used the synthetic genetic array (SGA) method to combine a systematic genome-wide collection of gene deletions with an est1\xe2\x88\x86 mutation defective in telomerase (Costanzo et al. 2010). As recovery from senescence is a rare and stochastic process (Lundblad and Blackburn 1993; Nautiyal et al. 2002), we compared two high-throughput methods of measuring senescence. These two methods were analogous to low-throughput liquid culture or serial tooth-picking approaches (Lundblad and Blackburn 1993; Maringele and Lydall 2004a). In a liquid procedure we passaged yeast strains in 96-well plates, while in a solid agar procedure we passaged 1536 colonies per plate by pinning directly onto agar (Figure 1). The liquid procedure allowed greater dilution and therefore a greater range of divisions at each passage, but throughput was less efficient than in the pinning procedure. The liquid procedure had a higher risk of culture contamination. Two methods for genome-wide analysis of entry into and recovery from senescence. An est1::natMX strain (DLY5026) was crossed to the deletion mutant collection and double mutants were selected using SGA procedures. (A) Double mutants were passaged in 96-well plate liquid cultures, and fitness was monitored after spotting onto solid agar plates at 384 spot cell density for a total of 16 passages. (B) Cultures were serially pinned at 1536 colonies per plate and photographed for 22 passages. For the liquid senescence assay, 96-well plates that contained 60 different yfg\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 genotypes along with 36 independently generated his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 \xe2\x80\x9cwild type control\xe2\x80\x9d strains were inoculated. Cultures in 16 such replicate plates, each with independently generated double mutants, were grown in parallel (Figure S1 shows the plate layout). In combination with est1\xe2\x88\x86, we tested the effects of deleting 27 genes previously reported as affecting telomere length (Askree et al. 2004; Gatbonton et al. 2006; Shachar et al. 2008), 15 affecting DNA replication and repair (Collins et al. 2007), and 18 other genes that were randomly chosen controls or of some prior interest (Table S1). The his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains are suitable \xe2\x80\x9ccontrols\xe2\x80\x9d because, although HIS3 is disrupted with the KANMX marker, the cells express spHIS5 from the MATa-specific promoter and are therefore histidine prototrophs and expected to show no growth defects (Costanzo et al. 2010). In total, 16 yfg\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 and 576 his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 replicate cultures were examined in these liquid-based experiments. To follow growth in liquid, we used the procedure outlined in Figure 1A. Two-hundred microliter (200 \xce\xbcl) cultures were incubated for 22 hr at 30\xc2\xb0C without shaking, and then shaken to resuspend the yeast cells. A sample from each culture was then diluted approximately 1:70 into fresh media at each passage using a pin tool. To assess fitness at each passage, a separate sample from each culture was also diluted approximately 1:70 in water and spotted onto agar plates, at 384 spots per plate. Each of four 384-spot plates was incubated for 48 hr and photographed to determine cell density (Figure 2). A 1:70 dilution was a pragmatic choice of dilution in the range used in low-throughput experiments. In low-throughput experiments where we carefully count cell number at each passage and dilute back to 5 \xc3\x97 105 cells per milliliter every day (Figure S3), the dilution ranges from 1:600 for healthy cultures to 1:7 when cells are deeply senescent. Medium throughput liquid culture based senescence assay. 96-well cultures were spotted at 384 spots per agar plate, and plates photographed and analyzed after 48 hr growth. (A) Example images showing growth at passages 1, 5, 10, and 15. Four independent cultures of five genotypes are illustrated by the colored boxes. (B) Mean density profile (MDP) analysis for six genotypes for 16 passages. Mean culture size and standard deviations are shown. All images can be browsed on our supplementary website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/colonyzer/ChangSenescence/#images). It is clear that the majority of his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains, situated in the outer two rows/columns of each 384-spot plate, entered into and recovered from senescence over 16 passages (Figure 2). The majority of his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains grew well at passage 1, by passage 5 they grew very poorly, by passage 10 some had improved, and by passage 15 the majority had returned to a fitness similar to that at passage 1. At passage 15, some his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 cultures did not grow at all. This pattern of growth is consistent with the hypothesis that the SGA procedure worked efficiently and that most, but not all, telomerase-deficient his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 cultures entered into and recovered from telomere-initiated senescence. Recovery, in particular, was stochastic. To follow the behavior of individual cultures, it is useful to browse through senescent time courses, with each time point shown as a stack, in files (.tiff) from our supplementary data website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/colonyzer/ChangSenescence/#images). Because most gene deletions we chose to analyze affect DNA repair or telomere biology, most other strains (e.g., rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 and upf2\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86) grew poorly in comparison with his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains (Figure 2A). RAD52 is required for recombination-dependent maintenance of telomeres in the absence of telomerase, and as expected, by the first passage the majority of rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains were growing poorly and never recovered (Mceachern and Haber 2006). The slight increase in fitness at the end of the time course for rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains (Figure 2B) may reflect a RAD52-independent mechanism of survivor generation that occurs in this and some other genetic backgrounds (Grandin and Charbonneau 2009; Lebel et al. 2009). Interestingly, the effect of upf2\xe2\x88\x86, which affects nonsense-mediated RNA decay, has previously been reported to delay entry into senescence (Enomoto et al. 2004), whereas our data suggest that upf2\xe2\x88\x86 accelerates senescence in the est1\xe2\x88\x86 background and that upf2\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains only weakly recover (Figure 2). chk1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains behaved very similarly to his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains, whereas, interestingly, rif1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 and rif2\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains recovered from senescence more rapidly than the bulk of other strains and the control his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains. The effects of rif1\xe2\x88\x86 and rif2\xe2\x88\x86 can be seen from the high culture densities for these strains in passages 5 through 10, relative to neighboring cultures (Figure 2A). This is of interest because Rif1 and Rif2 have well-known roles in telomere biology, encoding proteins which bind via Rap1 to telomeric DNA, and are known to affect telomere capping (Addinall et al. 2011; Anbalagan et al. 2011; Chang et al. 2011). Interestingly, and consistent with our results, it was recently reported that rif1\xe2\x88\x86 and rif2\xe2\x88\x86 strains enter and recover from senescence more rapidly than other cell types (Chang et al. 2011). The positions of all other genes tested by this liquid senescence assay are shown in Figure S1, and one complete series of photographs are shown in Figure S2A. To utilize data from all replicate cultures and to allow quantitative comparison between strains, we constructed mean density profiles (MDP) for all genotypes. MDPs are curves showing the senescence characteristics of each genotype and are constructed after estimating yeast culture cell densities for repeat cultures of different genotypes at each passage from photographs using the image analysis tool Colonyzer (Lawless et al. 2010). Six examples of this type of analysis showing the MDP of each are shown in Figure 2B, and all 61 genotypes are shown in File S1. Analysis of 576 independent his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 cultures shows that at passage 1 they grew well, with an average fitness of around 4000 units (Figure 2b). As expected, strains became less fit with each passage, reaching a nadir of fitness at around passage 6, before recovering reasonable fitness by the end of the experiment at passage 16. The shape of this curve, combined with the fact that some cultures became sterile, is further evidence that the SGA procedures were efficient and that little contamination by other genotypes (e.g., diploids) or organisms (bacteria) was observed. By passage 16, at the end of the experiment, the mean fitness of his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains was nearly as high as that at passage 1, which was as expected because of the emergence of recombination-dependent survivors; however, a large variance in cell densities was observed (Figure 2B). This variance at passage 16 was largely due to some cultures being essentially dead (see Figure 2A), presumably because in these particular cultures no senescent cells recovered. Sterile cultures were expected because the majority of cells do not recover from senescence and only a small volume of cell culture (<3 \xc2\xb5l) was transferred each time. Variance also began to increase earlier in the experiment, most likely due the stochastic nature of entry into senescence. As expected from the examples shown in Figure 2A, chk1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains showed a similar MDP to his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains, although interestingly, there was less variance between repeated chk1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 cultures and less evidence of loss of vitality with time (Figure 2B, second panel from top). Quantitative analysis of 16 rad52\xe2\x88\x86, upf2\xe2\x88\x86, rif1\xe2\x88\x86, and rif2\xe2\x88\x86 strains was consistent with the images. We used MPDs to visually classify each of the 60 gene deletions into different classes (File S3). These included those that entered senescence rapidly, including mre11\xe2\x88\x86, xrs2\xe2\x88\x86, rad52\xe2\x88\x86, rad54\xe2\x88\x86, rad55\xe2\x88\x86, rad57\xe2\x88\x86, rtt101\xe2\x88\x86, rtt107\xe2\x88\x86, rtt109\xe2\x88\x86, pol32\xe2\x88\x86, upf1\xe2\x88\x86, upf2\xe2\x88\x86, upf3\xe2\x88\x86, dcc1\xe2\x88\x86, ctf8\xe2\x88\x86, ctf18\xe2\x88\x86, slx5\xe2\x88\x86, slx8\xe2\x88\x86, sgs1\xe2\x88\x86, rad27\xe2\x88\x86, mms1\xe2\x88\x86, mms22\xe2\x88\x86, cdc73\xe2\x88\x86, rtf1\xe2\x88\x86, rfm1\xe2\x88\x86, sum1\xe2\x88\x86, kem1\xe2\x88\x86, rrp8\xe2\x88\x86, asf1\xe2\x88\x86, tel1\xe2\x88\x86, elg1\xe2\x88\x86, hmo1\xe2\x88\x86, ede1\xe2\x88\x86, ydl118w\xe2\x88\x86, rho4\xe2\x88\x86, spt21\xe2\x88\x86, tsa1\xe2\x88\x86, lea1\xe2\x88\x86, and sla1\xe2\x88\x86; a large number that behaved normally, including exo1\xe2\x88\x86, chk1\xe2\x88\x86, rad9\xe2\x88\x86; and a small group of just three genes, est3\xe2\x88\x86, rif1\xe2\x88\x86, and rif2\xe2\x88\x86, consisting of mutants that appeared to enter senescence early and recover early. Table S1 summarizes the behavior of individual genes and whether the results we obtained were consistent with previously published studies. It is clear that our results largely reproduced results previously reported from detailed, high-quality, low-throughput experiments giving us confidence in our data. However, there were some interesting surprises, such as the behavior of upf1\xe2\x88\x86, upf2\xe2\x88\x86, and upf3\xe2\x88\x86 mutants that failed to recover from senescence here (Figure S5) but had previously been reported to delay senescence (Enomoto et al. 2004). In summary, the 96-well senescence assay was capable of measuring entry of telomerase-deficient cells into senescence and recovery. However, this procedure was comparatively inefficient and not readily scalable to performing a genome-wide analysis of genes that affect entry into/exit from senescence. Therefore, we also tested a much more parallel and efficient solid pinning procedure, discussed next. By pinning parallel colonies rather than growing liquid cultures, we increased throughput 36-fold. In pinning experiments, we grew a minimum of 8, sometimes 56 (for those on plate 15, which contained 24 extra copies of a small number of gene deletions), and in the case of his3\xe2\x88\x86, 144 independently generated double mutant cultures for a total of 22 passages. Comparing cell density estimates immediately after inoculation with estimates in stationary phase for robustly growing, 1536-format, pinned cultures, we estimate that the maximum dilution achievable at each passage with this method is 16-fold. It is clear that, as cultures were passaged, the fraction of viable cultures decreased, suggesting cells entered into senescence (Figure 3A). In some cultures, culture size decreased to a minimum and then increased (with increasing passage), suggesting that these cultures recovered from senescence. Figure 3A shows plate 15 that, in most cases, contains 24 independently generated yfg1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 double mutants and numerous his3\xe2\x88\x86 strains. Overlaid, colored boxes highlight the positions of his3\xe2\x88\x86, upf2\xe2\x88\x86, rad52\xe2\x88\x86, and chk1\xe2\x88\x86 strains, allowing a visual assessment of reproducibility between cultures. Figure S2 compares the growth of cells in the 1536 colony format with the lower throughput, 384-spot format across several passages. All senescent time course photographs, with each time point shown as a stack in files (.tiff), are in our supplementary data website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/colonyzer/ChangSenescence/#images). High-throughput, solid-culture-based senescence assay. 1536 parallel colonies were transferred from agar plates, photographed, and analyzed. (A) Example images showing culture size at passages 1, 6, 11, and 22. Representative sets of four independent cultures of four genotypes are indicated by colored boxes. Plate number 15 is presented, which has 24 independently generated double mutant cultures per genotype, whereas plates 1 to 14 only have 4 independent cultures per strain. (B) Mean density profiles (MDP) for six genotypes for 22 passages. Mean culture size and standard deviations are shown. (C) Examples of rif1\xe2\x88\x86 and rif2\xe2\x88\x86 strain growth during passage. All images can be browsed on our supplementary website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/colonyzer/ChangSenescence/#images). If strains had entered into and recovered from senescence, then telomere structure should alter, showing Type I\xe2\x80\x93 and Type II\xe2\x80\x93type structures typical of cells using recombination-dependent ALT mechanisms to maintain telomeres (Lundblad and Blackburn 1993; Teng and Zakian 1999). Importantly, Southern blots showed that the telomere structures of strains that had been passaged on solid plates had indeed altered, forming typical Type I or Type II survivors (Figure S4). In addition many of the DNA repair mutants known to be defective in recovery from senescence did not recover from senescence in these highly parallel experiments (e.g., rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86, Figure 3A). These two observations strongly suggest that most, if not all, est1\xe2\x88\x86 cells that were remaining after 22 passages had entered into and recovered from senescence and, therefore, that the high-throughput 1536 solid pinning approach is a useful method for following the senescence process. We generated MDPs of all 4299 genotypes over 22 passages, and plots of these profiles together with culture size standard deviations are available (File S2). It is interesting to compare the solid pinning data (File S2) with that for the 60 strains also analyzed in liquid culture, 6 of which are shown in Figure 3B, and the remainder of which are shown in File S2. In contrast to the pattern observed in liquid cultures, in pinning experiments evidence of a period of poor growth followed by recovery for many strains was less striking (e.g., MDPs for his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 and chk1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains, Figure 3B). However, it is notable that the variance in fitness increased with passage for each of these strains, more so for his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 than for chk1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains, and that his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains showed an overall decline in fitness that plateaued around passage 15. We believe that the lack of clear decline and recovery in the solid experiments is because of the low dilution at each passage (16-fold in solid vs. 70-fold in liquid). rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains entered senescence and failed to recover, as expected, but interestingly showed different growth patterns in solid vs. liquid plates. At passage 1, the fitness of rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains (1400 units) was clearly less than the fitness of est1\xe2\x88\x86 chk1\xe2\x88\x86 and est1\xe2\x88\x86 his3\xe2\x88\x86 strains (2000 units). This most likely is due the low fitness induced by deletion of RAD52 itself. With time, the fitness of rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 declined until, by passage 10, cultures were very small and did not really recover. The rate of entry of rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 cultures into senescence was much slower than that observed in liquid cultures, consistent with cultures being diluted less on solid agar compared with liquid cultures and, therefore, having less potential to divide. Curiously, the density profiles of upf2\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains on solid pins seemed to be more similar to his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains than to rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains. Conversely, in liquid cultures, upf2\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains are more similar to rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains (compare the density profiles in Figures 2B and 3B). We are unsure of the reason for this difference, but it seems to be reproducible as the effects of upf1\xe2\x88\x86, upf2\xe2\x88\x86, and upf3\xe2\x88\x86 mirror each other in both solid and liquid cultures (Figure S5). Disrupting the nonsense-mediated RNA decay pathway affects many different transcripts and, hence, cellular processes, including those relevant to telomere biology (Addinall et al. 2011; Enomoto et al. 2004). Thus the explanation for the differences between solid and liquid cultures may be as trivial as the upf\xe2\x88\x86 strains forming cultures more easily from dense inoculum after pinning on solid agar than from the dilute inoculum used in liquid cultures. Finally rif1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 and rif2\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 mutants essentially behaved as expected given the liquid culture results and, if anything, improved fitness with time (Figure 3B). To help classify the behavior of the thousands of different genotypes, we generated MDPs for each of the \xe2\x88\xbc4300 gene deletion strains (File S4). We classified strains according to the similarity of their MDP to that of three archetypal gene disruptions: his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86, a neutral control strain (Figure 4A, B and File S5); rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86, affecting a typical gene required for recovery from senescence (Figure 4C, D, File S6, and File S7); and rif1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86, showing accelerated entry into and exit from senescence (Figure 4E, F and File S8). Similarity between MDPs was quantified using Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s correlation coefficient (r). Three senescence profile archetypes. Mean density profiles (MDP) were estimated for each of 4300 gene deletions combined with est1\xe2\x88\x86. Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s correlation coefficient (r) was calculated for each mutation compared with his3\xe2\x88\x86, rad52\xe2\x88\x86, and rif1\xe2\x88\x86 mutations, representing three distinct senescence curve archetypes. (A) A heat map showing the MDP of the mutations having the 14 highest correlations with that of his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86. (B) All 3035 MDPs (pink) correlating strongly (r > 0.85) are shown along with the MDP of the archetype his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 (red), and the mean curve of the 3036 strongly correlating MDPs (black). (C) A heat map showing the MDP of the mutations having the 20 highest correlations with that of rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86. To construct this group, we only included strains whose culture size at passage 2 was less than Cs = 1680, where Cs = Cave \xe2\x80\x93 0.5*CSD, Cave is the average of all double mutant culture sizes at passage 2, CSD is the culture size standard deviation at that passage. (D) All 208 MDPs (pink) correlating strongly (r > 0.5, culture size < Cs) with the MDP of rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 (red), together with the average of the 209 strongly correlating MDPs (black). (E) A heat map showing the MDP of the mutations having the 14 highest correlations with that of rif1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86. (F) Twenty gene disruptions whose MDPs (pink) correlate best with the MDP of rif1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 (red), together with the average of the 21 most strongly correlating MDPs (black). (G) Scale for heat maps. As we expected, the vast majority (more than 3000) of the double mutants can be classified in the category of \xe2\x80\x9cnormal senescence\xe2\x80\x9d (Figure 4A), defined as mutants whose MDP correlates well with that of his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains (r > 0.85). There was a general trend of lower density across all passages for these strains (Figure 4B); at late passages, this is essentially due to mean density being estimated from a mixture of strongly growing cultures and sterile or poorly growing cultures (e.g., Figure 3A, P22 Supp Fig S2). In this class, the mean density plateaued around passage 18. In normal senescence strains, on average 50% of cultures recovered growth by passage 19. Interestingly, the gene deletions whose MDP have the strongest anticorrelation with his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 strains include many genes affecting telomere maintenance, DNA damage response, and cell-cycle control (bottom of File S5). In fact, the five strains whose MDP is least well correlated with those of his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 (rif2\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86, rad27\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86, rif1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86, elg1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86, and est3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86) are the strongest examples of the rif1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 archetype, which we define below. Using a strict correlation cut off (r > 0.85) leaves only three members of the rif1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 class; however, we can see in Figure 4F that the 20 most highly correlated genes display a distinctive MDP. Deletions in this class appear not only to speed up senescence but also to accelerate the appearance of survivors. For strains in this class, on average 81% of cultures recovered growth by passage 19. Interestingly, EST3, RIF1, RIF2, and TEL1 are genes that are well known to affect telomere maintenance and Chang et al. (2011) reported that rif1\xe2\x88\x86 and rif2\xe2\x88\x86 mutants accelerated entry into and recovery from senescence in rif1\xe2\x88\x86 est2\xe2\x88\x86 and rif2\xe2\x88\x86 est2\xe2\x88\x86 mutants. The effects of est3\xe2\x88\x86 on est1\xe2\x88\x86 mutants that we have observed are not consistent with previous reports (Lendvay et al. 1996). However, we have confirmed this phenotype in careful low throughput experiments in the different W303 genetic background (Figure S3). The tel1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 results from previous studies are somewhat conflicting (Abdallah e",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 al. 2009; Chan et al. 2001; Enomoto et al. 2002; Ritchie and Petes 2000, Table S1). Some previous data agree with our results whereas other data do not; it is not clear whether the differences are due to strain background or some other factor, such as experimental design. Other genes in this class, notably ELG1 encoding a replication factor C (RFC)-type protein and with known telomere-related phenotypes (Smolikov et al. 2004), warrant further study. There were 208 double mutants (File S7) having an MDP that correlated well with that of rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 (r > 0.5, culture size at passage 2 < 1680, Figure 4C, D). For strains in this class, on average 29% of cultures recovered growth by passage 19. This subset is interesting because it contains many genes required, in principal, for recovery from telomere-initiated senescence, and orthologs of such genes could play critical roles during carcinogenesis, particularly in ALT tumors. Consistent with the role of this gene class at telomeres, there was a strong enrichment of gene deletions previously found to result in short telomeres but not in long telomeres (Askree et al. 2004; Gatbonton et al. 2006; Shachar et al. 2008; Figure 5A). This enrichment is perhaps not surprising because cells with gene deletions inducing short telomeres are likely to enter senescence faster than those with gene deletions that result in normal length or long telomeres. Properties of gene deletions that cause similar effects to rad52\xe2\x88\x86 in an est1\xe2\x88\x86 background. (A) Venn diagram showing gene deletions reported to result in significantly shorter (red) or longer (green) telomeres (Askree et al. 2004; Gatbonton et al. 2006; Shachar et al. 2008) and those we classified as similar to the rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 archetype (black). (B) Gene ontology (process) analysis demonstrating the P values for significance of over representation of terms (both GO terms and classifications from other screens) over represented in the class similar to the rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 archetype. To further characterize this class, we subjected the genes with MDP similar to the rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 archetype to a \xe2\x80\x9cgene ontology (GO) yeast process\xe2\x80\x9d analysis. Interestingly, we found significant enrichment for genes involved in response to stress, chromosome organization, DNA metabolic processes, cellular membrane organization, vesicle-mediated transport, transcription DNA dependence, cell cycle, and protein modification (Figure 5B). Our results suggest that these genes share many properties and may play an important role in replicative senescence and might do so by affecting several cell processes. Moreover, when subjecting these genes to a GO analysis, we identified many components of known and relevant complexes, for instance, the MRX complex and the Ctf18 RFC\xe2\x80\x93like complex (Table 1). The MRX complex has many known roles at telomeres, and when deletions are combined with deletions in the Ku complex, the double mutants enter senescence like telomerase-deficient strains (Dubois et al. 2002; Maringele and Lydall 2004a). However, we are unaware of reports of the MRX complex inhibiting senescence. The Ctf18 complex does have roles at telomeres (Addinall et al. 2011; Hiraga et al. 2006; Khair et al. 2010); however, as far as we are aware, this is the first report showing that deletion of components of this complex accelerates senescence. The mechanisms by which these complexes affect replicative senescence need to be clarified in future studies. The high-throughput senesence assays we report here are complementary to other high-throughput studies aimed at understanding telomere or chromosome biology. For example, Addinall et al. (2011) performed systematic suppressor/enhancer analyses on yeast strains containing temperature-sensitive telomere capping defects caused by cdc13-1 or yku70\xe2\x88\x86 mutations. All gene deletions were classified as suppressing, enhancing, or showing no strong interaction with each defect, and interaction strengths were quantified. The two datasets were compared in a single plot, and it is interesting to overlay gene deletions that behave like rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 in high-throughput senescence assays on this plot (Figure 6A). Gene deletions that cause similar effects to rad52\xe2\x88\x86 in an est1\xe2\x88\x86 background are enriched for deletions that negatively interact with yku70\xe2\x88\x86 but not cdc13-1. (A) Gene deletions identified in this study as accelerating senescence overlaid on data showing genes that suppress or enhance temperature-sensitive growth defects caused by cdc13-1 or yku70\xe2\x88\x86. The data points are from Figure 4 in Addinall et al. 2011. Genes are highlighted in blue if their mean density profile (MDP) is classed as similar to the rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 archetype, in red if they additionally have a short telomere phenotype, or in green if they additionally have a long telomere phenotype as defined before (Askree et al. 2004; Gatbonton et al. 2006; Shachar et al. 2008) (B) Left: Fraction of strains similar to the rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 archetype found in indicated regions of the genetic interaction profile presented in panel A. Right: Fraction of total gene deletions tested found in indicated regions of the genetic interaction profile presented in panel A. Interestingly, most of the gene deletions that accelerated senescence also enhanced yku70\xe2\x88\x86 temperature-sensitive growth defects but showed no significant bias toward either positive or negative effects on the fitness of cdc13-1 mutants. This is shown by the clear left/right but lack of top/bottom bias of such strains in Figure 6. The yku70\xe2\x88\x86 mutants have short telomeres, similar to those of telomerase-deficient, pre-senescent cells, whereas cdc13-1 mutants have telomeres of normal length or slightly longer than normal (Zubko and Lydall 2006). Therefore, a simple explanation for this bias is that the gene deletions highlighted on the left of Figure 6A contribute to the ability of cells with short telomeres to continue through the cell cycle. These data also suggest that yku70\xe2\x88\x86 is perhaps a better model for telomere-initiated senescence than cdc13-1. Global genetic analyses in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified a pathway, including ASF1, RTT109, MMS1, MMS22, RTT101, and RTT107, instrumental to cell survival after replisome stalling (Collins et al. 2007; Duro et al. 2008; Pan et al. 2006; Zaidi et al. 2008). Interestingly, it has been proposed that RAD52 and MMS1 are essential for pre-senescence growth (Abdallah et al. 2009). To further investigate this pathway in telomerase-deficient cells, we examined the behavior of these strains in both our high-throughput and low-throughput screens. We found that not only RAD52 and MMS1 but also ASF1, RTT109, MMS22, RTT101, and RTT107 showed an accelerated senescence phenotype when deleted in both screens (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure S6). These results strongly suggest that replication fork progression plays an important role in replicative senescence. However, our data also suggest that there are many additional pathways/complexes affecting replicative senescence (Figure 5, Table 1). It will be interesting to investigate the roles of these pathways/complexes further. We report the first genome-wide analysis of the effects of gene deletions on entry into and exit from telomere-initiated senescence in S. cerevisiae. We have successfully carried out a medium-throughput, liquid-based senescence screen and a high-throughput, solid pin-based screen. Although the liquid-based screen is a valuable source of data describing the behavior of 60 gene deletions hand-picked for the relevance of their effect on entry into and recovery from senescence, we chose to perform a genome-wide analysis of 4299 genes by using a solid pinning approach because it was much more efficient (36 times the throughput). Inevitably, the high-throughput pinning approach suffers from a lack of resolution compared with the liquid-based approach. Nevertheless, it contains a great deal of valuable quantitative information. We have constructed a high-quality dataset demonstrating senescence profiles for all 4299 gene deletions in the knockout library combined with a telomerase defect that will complement other low- and high-throughput analyses of telomere biology and the DNA damage response. We chose to classify double deletion mutations based on the similarity of their MDPs to those of archetypal mutations: his3\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 (normal), rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 (accelerated entry into senescence and failure to recover), and rif1\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 (accelerated entry into senescence and recovery). However, other clustering or analysis approaches may also prove informative. For example, we also performed unsupervised hierarchical quality threshold (QT) clustering to identify 23 different MDP classes (Figure S8). The MDPs which we constructed (e.g., File S2 and File S4), together with the images and raw quantifications from which they are derived, are published to allow others to analyze our dataset using different approaches, for example, by searching for strains whose deletions result in MDPs correlating strongly with those of archetypes of specific interest, which could be different to the three presented here. The rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 archetype strain and mutants in this class show poor growth when generated by SGA immediately after germination. Therefore we tested whether additional information is gained from continuing to passage such poor-growing strains. To address this issue, we chose to compare our rad52\xe2\x88\x86-like cluster with genes we identified as growing poorly with est1\xe2\x88\x86 at passage 0 in our experiments, and with analogous datasets from large-scale, genome-wide synthetic lethal analysis experiments (Costanzo et al. 2010). Figure S7A shows that there is overlap among these three datasets but that they are clearly not identical. The group of strains with MDP similar to that of the rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 archetype is distinct from that which we identified as synthetic lethal interactions immediately after SGA (File S10 and File S11). To compare the relative merits of each dataset, the member strains of each are highlighted in Figure S7C\xe2\x80\x93F on plots similar to Figure 6. Interestingly, the left right/bias we observed for the strains in the rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 class (Figure 6 and S7C) is not as pronounced in the other datasets. This strongly suggests that gene deletions we identified in the rad52\xe2\x88\x86 est1\xe2\x88\x86 class, based on their behavior with repeated passage, have different properties than those growing poorly at early passages identified by us or in the Costanzo et al. (2010) dataset. Therefore we conclude that, at the very least, our high-throughput senescence assays complement the existing datasets, identifying gene deletions with notably different properties. Our dataset is a rich resource for those working in telomere biology in budding yeast and other eukaryotic organisms. All our data are freely available, and there are numerous provocative and interesting observations worthy of further investigation. For example, the genes behaving like RAD52 or RIF1 show very interesting effects on the senescence process in budding yeast. Although some genes in the RAD52 class, such as SLX5, SLX8, and MMS1, were previously reported to affect the processes of recovery from senescence, we have identified 200 or more genes in this class. Our data also shed new light on the functions of proteins with known roles in telomere biology, such as Elg1 or members of the Ctf18 complex. We imagine that iterations of our genome-wide approach to understand senescence, perhaps utilizing genome-wide liquid passage approaches, like Figure 2, or \xe2\x80\x9cbar code\xe2\x80\x93based\xe2\x80\x9d approaches (Hillenmeyer et al. 2008), may extend our systematic analysis of gene deletions affecting telomere-driven senescence. It may also be interesting to perform genome-wide screens analyzing the effects of deleting other protein or RNA subunits of telomerase, as we have shown that deleting the EST3 gene affects the senescence profile of est1\xe2\x88\x86 mutants in a manner analogous to rif1\xe2\x88\x86 mutants. It may also be interesting to extend this approach to S. pombe, where telomere biology is significantly different from S. cerevisiae and genome-wide knockout libraries and SGA approaches are now available (Dixon et al. 2008; Roguev et al. 2007). It will be more technically challenging to perform analogous studies in mammalian cells.

The effort to incorporate the resistance from hexaploid wheat or wild relatives to cultivated durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum Desf.) have not been successful in providing resistance to the level of the donor parents. In this study, we used 171 BC1F6 and 169 BC1F7 lines derived from crossing of four Tunisian tetraploid sources of resistance (Tun7, Tun18, Tun34, Tun36) with durum cultivars \xe2\x80\x98Ben,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Maier,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Lebsock,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Mountrail\xe2\x80\x99 for association studies. The Tun18 and Tun7 FHB resistances were found to be comparable to the best hexaploid wheat sources. A new significant QTL for FHB resistance was identified on the long arm of chromosome 5B (Qfhs.ndsu-5BL) with both association and classical QTL mapping analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks extending up to 40 cM were evident in these populations. The linear mixed model considering the structure (Q or P) and the kinship matrix (KT) estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) was identified as the best for association studies in a mixture of wheat populations from a breeding program. The results of association mapping analysis also demonstrated a region on the short arm of chromosome 3B as potentially linked to FHB resistance. This region is in proximity of major FHB resistance gene fhb1 reported in hexaploid wheat. A possibility of having susceptibility or suppressor of resistance gene(s) on durum wheat chromosome 2A was further confirmed in this material, explaining the problem in developing resistant genotypes without counter selection against this region.Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused mainly by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide (Cuthbert et al. 2007; Liu and Anderson 2003). Host resistance is considered as the most effective method to control FHB. But the efforts in this area have been hampered by the limited number of effective genes and the complexity of the resistance mechanism in identified sources (Cuthbert et al. 2007). Sources of resistance to FHB are mostly restricted to Chinese hexaploid genotypes, such as Sumai3 and Wangshuibai (Mardi et al. 2005; Waldron et al. 1999) and, to a limited extent, Frontana from Brazil (Mardi et al. 2006). The lack of resistance sources in tetraploid wheat has limited the progress in durum wheat (T. turgidum L. var. durum Desf.) breeding for FHB resistance and has shifted the effort toward using the wild emmer wheat and wheat alien species (Oliver et al. 2005; Oliver et al. 2007). The most effective quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Type II FHB resistance (resistance to disease spread within the spike) have been found on chromosome 3BS (fhb1) and chromosome 6BS (fhb2) of Sumai3-derived populations (Cuthbert et al. 2006, 2007). Otto et al. (2002) proposed a new source of resistance carried on the short arm of chromosome 3A from T. diccocoides, not located in a homeologous region as fhb1 on 3BS. Another QTL for fungal penetration (Type I) and, to a lesser extent, spread (Type II) was consistently found on chromosome 5A (Qfhs.ifa-5A) (Buerstmayr et al. 2009; Buerstmayr et al. 2003). So far the QTL for FHB resistance have been identified on all of the wheat (mostly hexaploids) chromosomes except for 7D (Buerstmayr et al. 2009). As the major genetic effect of the FHB resistance genes is additive, it should be possible to accumulate different genes to enhance FHB resistance in wheat (Bai et al. 2000). Association mapping utilizes linkage disequilibrium (LD) to discover marker/trait associations for a set of diverse germplasm or sets of inbred lines resulting from multiple crosses (Zhu et al. 2008). Association mapping analysis was initially developed for human linkage studies due to obvious limitation of structured populations derived from controlled crosses. Association mapping or LD mapping has been extended to plant studies, and many QTL have recently been identified and confirmed by means of this method (Agrama et al. 2007; Breseghello and Sorrells 2006; Casa et al. 2008; Christopher et al. 2007; Crossa et al. 2007; Maccaferri et al. 2011; Parisseaux and Bernardo 2004; Sk\xc3\xb8t et al. 2007; Stich et al. 2006; Tommasini et al. 2007). Association mapping is not only powerful in detecting QTL in natural populations or germplasm collections (Abdurakhmonov and Abdukarimov 2008), but it is also a good approach for detecting QTL in a routinely generated breeding program termed \xe2\x80\x9cin silico mapping\xe2\x80\x9d (Parisseaux and Bernardo 2004). Achieving success in association mapping depends on the separation of LD due to linkage or true association from other factors that make spurious associations (Malosetti et al. 2007; Stich and Melchinger 2009) and the statistical analysis that eliminates false positives (Kang et al. 2008). There are many advantages of association mapping in breeding populations compared with traditional QTL mapping, such as use of large populations with phenotypic data collected through multiple locations and years, diverse genetic backgrounds with multiple allele polymorphism, and availability of populations and phenotypic data (Parisseaux and Bernardo 2004). By using breeding populations, the probability of having false positive LD due to the population structure and familial relatedness is increased (Myles et al. 2009; Zhu et al. 2008). This can be solved by using a linear regression model (Breseghello and Sorrells 2006) or a logistic regression model (Pritchard et al. 2000; Thornsberry et al. 2001) to correct for population structure. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used by Price et al. (2006) to account for subpopulation effects. By using these two methods, just limited events of relatedness that occur in a few axes of variation can be captured and removed from analysis. For example, with extended pedigrees where many of the individuals have a close relatedness (such as most breeding populations), a pairwise relatedness matrix called the kinship matrix (K) can be used to remove the false positive LDs due to the structure, selection, and admixture (Myles et al. 2009). Yu et al. (2006) proposed a linear mixed model to combine the outcome of population structure (Q matrix) with the marker-based K matrix, and they showed its power in reducing the number of false positives. This approach was successfully implemented in potato (Malosetti et al. 2007), Arabidopsis (Kang et al. 2008), maize (Weber et al. 2007), and wheat with minor modifications to improve the power of the mixed model (Stich et al. 2008) and to increase computational speed (Kang et al. 2008). The North Dakota State University durum wheat breeding program has identified four tetraploid wheat sources of resistance from Tunisia, which were selected among a large number of lines evaluated over five repeated FHB trials. As the pedigree of these Tunisian lines shows no relation to Chinese genotypes, it is expected that they carry different alleles for resistance to FHB and could complement those loci. The objectives of our study were 1) to investigate the association of molecular markers with FHB resistance in different breeding populations derived from Tunisian lines; 2) to find the best model of association mapping analysis in the highly structured and related breeding populations; and 3) to compare the result of association mapping with classical QTL mapping analysis of one of the largest bi-parental populations in this analysis. The QTL identified in this study can be directly selected in the current breeding program utilizing these Tunisian-derived lines.'","b'Sources of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat are mostly restricted to Chinese hexaploid genotypes. The effort to incorporate the resistance from hexaploid wheat or wild relatives to cultivated durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum Desf.) have not been successful in providing resistance to the level of the donor parents. In this study, we used 171 BC1F6 and 169 BC1F7 lines derived from crossing of four Tunisian tetraploid sources of resistance (Tun7, Tun18, Tun34, Tun36) with durum cultivars \xe2\x80\x98Ben,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Maier,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Lebsock,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Mountrail\xe2\x80\x99 for association studies. The Tun18 and Tun7 FHB resistances were found to be comparable to the best hexaploid wheat sources. A new significant QTL for FHB resistance was identified on the long arm of chromosome 5B (Qfhs.ndsu-5BL) with both association and classical QTL mapping analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks extending up to 40 cM were evident in these populations. The linear mixed model considering the structure (Q or P) and the kinship matrix (KT) estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) was identified as the best for association studies in a mixture of wheat populations from a breeding program. The results of association mapping analysis also demonstrated a region on the short arm of chromosome 3B as potentially linked to FHB resistance. This region is in proximity of major FHB resistance gene fhb1 reported in hexaploid wheat. A possibility of having susceptibility or suppressor of resistance gene(s) on durum wheat chromosome 2A was further confirmed in this material, explaining the problem in developing resistant genotypes without counter selection against this region. Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused mainly by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide (Cuthbert et al. 2007; Liu and Anderson 2003). Host resistance is considered as the most effective method to control FHB. But the efforts in this area have been hampered by the limited number of effective genes and the complexity of the resistance mechanism in identified sources (Cuthbert et al. 2007). Sources of resistance to FHB are mostly restricted to Chinese hexaploid genotypes, such as Sumai3 and Wangshuibai (Mardi et al. 2005; Waldron et al. 1999) and, to a limited extent, Frontana from Brazil (Mardi et al. 2006). The lack of resistance sources in tetraploid wheat has limited the progress in durum wheat (T. turgidum L. var. durum Desf.) breeding for FHB resistance and has shifted the effort toward using the wild emmer wheat and wheat alien species (Oliver et al. 2005; Oliver et al. 2007). The most effective quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Type II FHB resistance (resistance to disease spread within the spike) have been found on chromosome 3BS (fhb1) and chromosome 6BS (fhb2) of Sumai3-derived populations (Cuthbert et al. 2006, 2007). Otto et al. (2002) proposed a new source of resistance carried on the short arm of chromosome 3A from T. diccocoides, not located in a homeologous region as fhb1 on 3BS. Another QTL for fungal penetration (Type I) and, to a lesser extent, spread (Type II) was consistently found on chromosome 5A (Qfhs.ifa-5A) (Buerstmayr et al. 2009; Buerstmayr et al. 2003). So far the QTL for FHB resistance have been identified on all of the wheat (mostly hexaploids) chromosomes except for 7D (Buerstmayr et al. 2009). As the major genetic effect of the FHB resistance genes is additive, it should be possible to accumulate different genes to enhance FHB resistance in wheat (Bai et al. 2000). Association mapping utilizes linkage disequilibrium (LD) to discover marker/trait associations for a set of diverse germplasm or sets of inbred lines resulting from multiple crosses (Zhu et al. 2008). Association mapping analysis was initially developed for human linkage studies due to obvious limitation of structured populations derived from controlled crosses. Association mapping or LD mapping has been extended to plant studies, and many QTL have recently been identified and confirmed by means of this method (Agrama et al. 2007; Breseghello and Sorrells 2006; Casa et al. 2008; Christopher et al. 2007; Crossa et al. 2007; Maccaferri et al. 2011; Parisseaux and Bernardo 2004; Sk\xc3\xb8t et al. 2007; Stich et al. 2006; Tommasini et al. 2007). Association mapping is not only powerful in detecting QTL in natural populations or germplasm collections (Abdurakhmonov and Abdukarimov 2008), but it is also a good approach for detecting QTL in a routinely generated breeding program termed \xe2\x80\x9cin silico mapping\xe2\x80\x9d (Parisseaux and Bernardo 2004). Achieving success in association mapping depends on the separation of LD due to linkage or true association from other factors that make spurious associations (Malosetti et al. 2007; Stich and Melchinger 2009) and the statistical analysis that eliminates false positives (Kang et al. 2008). There are many advantages of association mapping in breeding populations compared with traditional QTL mapping, such as use of large populations with phenotypic data collected through multiple locations and years, diverse genetic backgrounds with multiple allele polymorphism, and availability of populations and phenotypic data (Parisseaux and Bernardo 2004). By using breeding populations, the probability of having false positive LD due to the population structure and familial relatedness is increased (Myles et al. 2009; Zhu et al. 2008). This can be solved by using a linear regression model (Breseghello and Sorrells 2006) or a logistic regression model (Pritchard et al. 2000; Thornsberry et al. 2001) to correct for population structure. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used by Price et al. (2006) to account for subpopulation effects. By using these two methods, just limited events of relatedness that occur in a few axes of variation can be captured and removed from analysis. For example, with extended pedigrees where many of the individuals have a close relatedness (such as most breeding populations), a pairwise relatedness matrix called the kinship matrix (K) can be used to remove the false positive LDs due to the structure, selection, and admixture (Myles et al. 2009). Yu et al. (2006) proposed a linear mixed model to combine the outcome of population structure (Q matrix) with the marker-based K matrix, and they showed its power in reducing the number of false positives. This approach was successfully implemented in potato (Malosetti et al. 2007), Arabidopsis (Kang et al. 2008), maize (Weber et al. 2007), and wheat with minor modifications to improve the power of the mixed model (Stich et al. 2008) and to increase computational speed (Kang et al. 2008). The North Dakota State University durum wheat breeding program has identified four tetraploid wheat sources of resistance from Tunisia, which were selected among a large number of lines evaluated over five repeated FHB trials. As the pedigree of these Tunisian lines shows no relation to Chinese genotypes, it is expected that they carry different alleles for resistance to FHB and could complement those loci. The objectives of our study were 1) to investigate the association of molecular markers with FHB resistance in different breeding populations derived from Tunisian lines; 2) to find the best model of association mapping analysis in the highly structured and related breeding populations; and 3) to compare the result of association mapping with classical QTL mapping analysis of one of the largest bi-parental populations in this analysis. The QTL identified in this study can be directly selected in the current breeding program utilizing these Tunisian-derived lines. A collection of backcross-derived advanced breeding lines consisting of resistant lines, susceptible sibs, and resistant sources were used in this study. A total of 171 BC1F7 and 169 BC1F6 lines derived from multiple crosses of four Tunisian sources (Tun7, Tun18, Tun34, Tun36) with durum cultivars \xe2\x80\x98Ben\xe2\x80\x99 (Elias and Miller 1998), \xe2\x80\x98Maier\xe2\x80\x99 (Elias and Miller 2000a), \xe2\x80\x98Lebsock\xe2\x80\x99 (Elias et al. 2001), and \xe2\x80\x98Mountrail\xe2\x80\x99 (Elias and Miller 2000b) were used for association mapping analysis (Figure 1). Pedigrees of durum wheat lines derived from FHB-resistant Tunisian lines. Three different isolates of Fusarium graminearum (R010, R1267, and R1322) were cultured and prepared separately. A mixture suspension of these three isolates was prepared (50,000 conidiospores per milliliter) just prior to inoculation. A 10 \xc2\xb5l droplet of the conidial suspension was injected into one of the florets in the middle of spike on each plant. The parents and RILs were screened in the greenhouse for two seasons during 2006 and 2007 for Type II resistance to FHB by the previously described method (Stack et al. 2002). The parents were planted in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three and six replicates in 2006 and 2007, respectively, while progenies were planted in RCBD with two replicates in both years. Sumai3 and ND2710 (Frohberg et al. 2004), which are both hexaploid wheat, were used as controls for resistance, and D87450 (durum wheat) was used as susceptible check. The FHB severity was scored using 0 to 100% scale by counting the infected spikelets divided by the number of the total spikelets (infection rate) in a spike. To collect the phenotypic data, the infection rate from two inoculated spikelets per plant was reported, and the average of those values was used as the data point. (Data is provided in supporting information, File S2.) The DNA extraction was performed on a bulk of one leaf from at least 10 three-week-old plants per line following the methods described by Guidet et al. (1991) with minor modifications. The concentration of the DNA was measured by NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FL). The samples were diluted to the concentration of 100 ng/\xce\xbcl, and 20 \xce\xbcl of the samples were sent for DArT markers analysis by Triticarte Pty. Ltd., as described by Akbari et al. (2006). A total of 2300 DArT markers, distributed across the entire wheat genome, were screened on the entire population. (Data is provided in File S2.) The polymorphic markers for the population derived from the crosses of Tun34 and \xe2\x80\x98Lebsock\xe2\x80\x99 were analyzed using JoinMap 4.0 (Van Ooijen 2006). Markers were assembled into linkage groups at likelihood ratio statistic (LOD) \xe2\x89\xa5 3.0 and assembled into a consensus map. Markers showing highly distorted segregation ratios (P < 0.005) were excluded from map assembly. The Kosambi mapping function (Kosambi 1943) was used to convert recombination frequencies into centimorgan map distances. QTL analysis was performed by Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test and interval mapping (Lander and Botstein 1989) on the genome using all 169 BC1F6 lines. Thereafter, multiple QTL mapping (MQM) on chromosome 5B (Jansen 1993; Jansen and Stam 1994) was carried out, where marker wPt-7279 and all markers on chromosome 2A were considered as cofactors. The significant threshold LOD score (P = 0.05) for detection of QTL on the whole genome was determined by 1000 permutations tests (Churchill and Doerge 1994). To find the association between the genetic markers and resistance to FHB, 10 different models previously discussed by Stich et al. (2008) were tested to correct the structure and the coancestry relatedness in the entire population (see File S1). FastPHASE (Scheet and Stephens 2006) was used to impute missing data with default settings. Further, PowerMarker (Liu and Muse 2005) was used to find minor allele frequencies (MAF). Markers with MAF < 0.05 were removed from analysis. The best KT, QKT, and PKT matrices were obtained using the lowest mean square difference (MSD) value among the 20 T value comparisons. The expected P values used for MSD calculation are obtained by dividing the rank of an observed P value with the total number of markers (Stich et al. 2008). We selected the best models, considering the lowest MSD between observed and expected P values of all marker loci and percentage of observations below nominal level (\xce\xb1 = 0.05) in a P(expected)-P(observed) plot (see File S1). For the selected model(s), positive false discovery rate (pFDR; Q values) were calculated (Storey 2002) using the PROC MULTTEST procedure in Statistical Analysis System (SAS 9.2) software. The markers associated with the FHB trait are based on a cutoff criteria of P < 0.05 and Q value < 0.1 (Weber et al. 2007). For the significant markers, the phenotypic variation (R2) was calculated using a simple regression equation. For markers mapped in the Tun34\xc3\x97Lebsock population with a known location on the genetic map, the LD coefficient (r2) was plotted against genetic distance, and locally weighed polynomial regression (LOESS)\xe2\x80\x93based fitting curves were used to infer the decay of LD as described in Breseghello and Sorrells (2006) and Maccaferri et al. (2011). The 95th percentile of the distribution of unlinked markers (markers on different chromosomes) was used to set the critical r2 value. The pedigree of 323 Tunisian-derived backcross inbred lines (BIL) and nine triple-cross inbred lines used for this study are shown in Figure 1. These lines were selected in the field for their FHB resistance and agronomic performance for cultivar development. However, they were also evaluated in the greenhouse for Type II resistance by the single-floret inoculation method described by Stack et al. (2002). There were statistically significant differences in FHB Type II disease severity between genotypes and also between the seasons (Table S1). The effects of two greenhouse seasons were not significant on the cultivars\xe2\x80\x99 infection reaction. The same scenario was seen for the entire population, as the correlation between the two season was very high (r = 0.91; P < 0.0001), and the effect of cultivar \xc3\x97 season was not significant (\xce\xb1 = 0.05). Therefore, FHB mean score values across the seasons were used as reliable data points in the analysis. Broad sense heritability was estimated to be 81% by calculation based on ANOVA (Bai et al. 2000). The results show that Tun7 and Tun18 have resistance comparable to the Chinese hexaploid source Sumai3 (Figure 2). Although Tun34, Tun36, and Tun108 show better resistance levels compared with common durum cultivars, their level of resistance is not statistically different from \xe2\x80\x98Lebsock\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Maier.\xe2\x80\x99 The Tun34\xc3\x97Lebsock cross had the largest population size (169 lines) and, therefore, was used for genetic mapping of the markers and classical QTL analysis. The progenies from this cross showed transgressive segregation for resistance to FHB. Nearly 8.5% of the progenies expressed higher levels of resistance to FHB, whereas 53% were more susceptible compared with the parents (Figure S1). Most of the other crosses (but not Tun18\xc3\x97Lebsock or Tun34\xc3\x97Ben) showed transgressive segregation for FHB resistance. Most of the crosses with \xe2\x80\x98Maier\xe2\x80\x99 produced plants with more resistance than both parents even in Tun7 and Tun18 crosses. These crosses produced progenies (1 out of 44 for Tun7\xc3\x97Maier population and 1 out of 18 for Tun18\xc3\x97Maier population) with the same resistance as Sumai3 and spring wheat resistant breeding line ND2710. The average of infection rate for susceptible durum cultivars and the Tunisian resistant sources derived from nine plants (two spikes in each plant) planted in two seasons in 2006 and 2007. D87450 was used as the susceptible check, and Sumai3 and ND2710 were used as the resistant controls. The letters on top of each column indicates the Duncan grouping of means at the probability level of 0.05. All the parents and progenies depicted in Figure 1 were genotyped using the DArT marker system. This system enabled scanning the entire genome to identify segments that carry FHB resistance genes (QTL). In DArT analysis, 2300 markers were used, of which 23% were polymorphic between the parents. About 8% of the polymorphic markers were present in all the Tunisian lines but absent in the susceptible cultivars. Cluster analysis of the polymorphic DArT markers revealed three distinct groups (Figure 3). The Tun7 line was in a separate group from the other two, and all other Tunisian lines were clustered in a separate group from susceptible durum cultivars. Genetic distance (D = \xe2\x88\x92LN J; J = Jaccard coefficient) dendrogram of Tunisian sources of FHB resistance and durum wheat cultivars based on 537 DArT markers scanning the whole genome. A genetic linkage map based on the population of Tun34\xc3\x97Lebsock was constructed. Out of 2300 DArT markers, 15% (379) were polymorphic after screening Tun34 and Lebsock parents. Genotypic data were incorporated into different linkage groups using the JoinMap 4.0 software (Van Ooijen 2006). The observed segregation ratio was compared with expected ratios for all markers using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test. Results indicated the segregation distortion of 5.2% (P < 0.01) for this population. To eliminate the bias effect of genetic mapping due to distorted loci, highly distorted loci (P < 0.005) were excluded from the analysis before mapping. Out of 379 markers, 359 were assigned (LOD \xe2\x89\xa5 3.0) into 44 linkage groups, with the minimum number of three markers per group. As is illustrated in Figure 4, almost all of the linkage groups (except 2) could be assigned to durum wheat chromosomes by alignment to previously published maps (Mantovani et al. 2008; Peleg et al. 2008; Semagn et al. 2006). The location of the DArT markers corresponded well to previously published durum wheat DArT maps with a few exceptions. As the 359 markers couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cover the whole genome, there were low-coverage regions on chromosomes 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 4B, 5B, and 7B and large gaps introduced to connect separate linkage groups on chromosomes 2A, 7B, and 5B. Overall, this map provided nearly 75% coverage of the genome compared with published maps. Genetic maps and approximated location of the QTL on the chromosome arms of Tun34\xc3\x97Lebsock population (units are cM). The associated markers to Type II FHB resistance found by both QTL and mixed model association mapping analysis are indicated by red stars. The markers revealed only by Kruskal-Wallis test are in blue and the one just found by linear mixed model analysis is in green. However, the only major QTL confirmed in this study is Qfhs.ndsu-5BL. The phenotypic and genotypic data from the Tun34\xc3\x97Lebsock population were analyzed by a nonparametric genomic scan based on the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test (P \xe2\x89\xa4 0.001) using the MapQTL5 software (Van Ooijen 2004) to identify genetic markers associated with putative QTL for FHB resistance. Results shown in Table 1 revealed five regions associated with FHB resistance, located on chromosomes 5B, 2A, 6B, 7A, and 7B. A region on chromosome arm 5BL (4 cM interval) showed the highest K score and an increase in FHB resistance due to alleles from Lebsock parent. Other QTL identified by this method have a lower K score (Table 1). Following the method described above, interval mapping (IM) was performed on the whole genome. The results of IM revealed presence of a significant QTL (LOD = 4.5) on chromosome 5B accounting for 11.8% of phenotypic variation (14.6% of genetic variation) for FHB. The significant threshold (LOD = 3.4) was based on a permutation test implemented as described in Material and Methods. To further study the major QTL on chromosome 5B, multiple QTL mapping (MQM) analysis was performed on this population. The phenotypic value explained by this QTL when wPt-1723 (7B), rPt-3887 (7B), and wPt-0054 (5B) were chosen as cofactors increased to 14.7% (18.1% of the genetic variation). Although the position of the QTL did not change, LOD score increased to 6.1. For LD analysis, 537 polymorphic markers were selected on the whole population of nine different crosses. As the frequencies of the alleles play an important role in LD analysis, we eliminated the alleles with minor frequencies of less than 0.05 (Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 5A, the frequency of the alleles shifted from 0.5 to 0.2 due to several rounds of selection in the breeding populations. The LD decay graph (Figure 5B) shows the LD decreased with increasing genetic map distance between marker loci. In this graph, syntenic r2 (estimated LD for the loci on the same chromosome) was plotted against map distance. The 95th percentile in the distributions of the estimated LD of unlinked loci (r2 = 0.06) was used to estimate the extent of LD across the genome according to Breseghello and Sorrells (2006). The intersection of the LOESS fitting curve at this critical LD threshold was estimated to be 40 cM. As the LD breakdown depends on the number, relatedness, and mating system of the lines, this high degree of LD is not unexpected considering the selection pressure for FHB resistance and backcrossing to generate the populations (Abdurakhmonov and Abdukarimov 2008; Flint-Garcia et al. 2003). (A) The frequencies of minor alleles in the populations are maximized at 0.2 due to the effect of selection. (B) The estimates of r2 vs. the genetic distances of the markers according to Tun34\xc3\x97Lebsock genetic map. The LD decay is around 40 cM by considering the critical value of 0.06. The association mapping was implemented not only on the entire data set but also for the lines derived from crosses of the same Tunisian resistant source. This could increase the frequency of alleles from the resistance parents in the population if they carry different alleles for FHB resistance. By dividing the data into different panels, the power of association mapping on population under 100 lines could be tested. The comparison between association mapping on the Tun34 panel and the classical QTL mapping results on Tun 34\xc3\x97Lebsock was also possible in our experiment. For each association method, the high MSD between observed and expected P values (uniform distribution) of all marker loci indicates that the empirical Type I error rate of these approaches is considerably higher than the nominal \xce\xb1-level (Stich et al. 2008). Therefore, MSD between observed and expected P values calculated for three different association mapping models (KT, QKT, and PKT) for all 20 measures for T value was used to find the best T value for each model (see File S1). The comparisons of all 10 models are summarized for the three different panels in Table S2. For the entire data, the MSD value of the KT(0.65) and QKT(0.65) was the lowest. Since the P values are assumed to be under uniform distribution (Yu et al. 2006), models that have a higher number of P values under a critical limit are usually non-uniform. The Na\xc3\xafve model has \xe2\x88\xbc11% of the observations under 5% threshold levels, while the two selected models (KT and QKT), have only 5% of the observations under the 5% threshold level. In Tun34 panel PKT(0.30) had the lowest MSD (0.0003), and only 6% of the observations were under the 5% threshold level. The performance of this model is better than Na\xc3\xafve model with MSD of 0.32. For the Tun7 panel, however, PKT(0.55) had the minimum MSD value (Table S2). For the entire data set, a union output of the two different models (KT and QKT) showed that markers from 1B, 2A, 3A, 3B, 4A, 5B, 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B are associated (P < 0.05) with FHB (Table 2). Of these 35 markers, association of 5 markers was significant after correcting for multiple testing using pFDR criterion (Q value < 0.1). All of these markers were from the same QTL located on 5BL. The other QTL found in this study were not confirmed by Q value less than 0.1, although the QTL from 3AS, 3BS, and 6BL seems promising as the pFDR criterion is close to significance. Twenty markers out of 35 could be mapped in Tun34\xc3\x97Lebsock population (Table 2). The mapping information of the rest of the markers in Table 2 was extracted from a consensus map version 4.0 released by Triticarte Pty. Ltd. For Tun34 panel, 24 markers had significant association with FHB resistance at P < 0.05 using the PKT(0.30) model. However, none of the associated markers had an acceptable pFDR (Q value < 0.1). By increasing the threshold for pFDR to Q value < 0.15, the same associated markers to FHB resistance can be found as the entire data set such as wPt-2885, wPt-6910, wPt-7400, and wPt-0054 from 5BL. By increasing the threshold, a marker from chromosome 3B (tpt-6487) can be considered as having a significant association to FHB resistance with a P value < 0.0006 and a Q value < 0.15. Although 13 markers had significant association to FHB resistance in Tun7 panel, none of them had an acceptable amount of pFDR, and all are considered as false positives in the analysis. There are limited sources of resistance to FHB in wheat, especially in durum or pasta wheat. Owing to this limitation, tremendous efforts have been made to introduce new sources of resistance from wild tetraploids, such as emmer (T. diccoccum), Persian (T. cathalicum), and Polish (T. polanicum), and from common wheat sources, such as Sumai3, to durum wheat with limited success (Garvin et al. 2009; Kumar et al. 2007). Transferring FHB resistance from other alien species, such as Lophopyrum elongatum, were reported to have produced durum lines with FHB resistance (Jauhar and Peterson 2009), but successful use of these lines carrying alien chromosomes in breeding programs has been a challenge. Two FHB-resistant Tunisian lines (Tun7 and Tum18) were found with promising levels of resistance to FHB Type II and were integrated into the North Dakota State University (NDSU) durum wheat breeding program. These two lines both show consistent low infection rates of about 10% comparable to the Sumai3, which is the most widely used source of resistance in hexaploid wheat (Figure 2). These two genotypes are also believed to represent different genetic backgrounds based on the genotyping results (Figure 3). This increases the likelihood of having different genes/alleles for Type II FHB resistance derived from these sources. Somers et al. (2006) crossed an accession of T. carthalicum, showing a moderate Type II resistance to FHB, with a durum wheat cultivar \xe2\x80\x98Strongfield\xe2\x80\x99 to introduce new QTL into a cultivated background. They observed transgressive segregation for FHB resistance in their population, with a few lines carrying QTL from both parents being more resistant than either parent. However, none of these lines have been released as a new cultivar. In this study, Tun34\xc3\x97Lebsock cross resulted in a population with transgressive segregation for FHB resistance. Both parents had an infection rate of about 20 to 30%, but a portion of the population (\xe2\x88\xbc8.5%) were found to have within 10 to 20% range of Type II disease severity. This may be due to the fact that \xe2\x80\x98Lebsock\xe2\x80\x99 is also moderately resistant and many minor genes for FHB resistance would be segregating in this population. Other subpopulations also show transgressive segregation, especially those derived from \xe2\x80\x98Maier\xe2\x80\x99, where some progenies had resistance levels similar to that of Sumai3 and ND2710 (a resistant spring wheat line derived from Sumai3). If these lines prove agronomically suitable, they can be released as new resistant cultivars. An advantage of doing association mapping in a breeding population is to investigate the associated genes to the trait of interest and track them in the process of breeding and selection. Large LD blocks are common in most breeding populations, which can be reduced by backcrossing with the cultivated parent. Having the associated markers in the same background provides a valuable tool to perform several backcrosses and reduce the LD blocks while tracking the resistance genes in the progenies by marker-assisted selection. The LD decay plot of r2 values vs. genetic distances between all markers across the genome showed that the LD extends up to 40 cM (Figure 5B). A number of factors can explain the large LD blocks observed in this study, such as mating system (self-pollination), population structure, relatedness (kinship), small number of population founders, admixture, epistasis, and selection (Abdurakhmonov and Abdukarimov 2008). There are different reports for LD decays in different self-pollinated crops. The extent of LD was 10 to 50 cM in 953 cultivated barley accessions (Malysheva-Otto et al. 2006) and 10 to 20 cM in 43 US elite wheat cultivars representing seven market classes (Chao et al. 2007). Crossa et al. (2007) mapped 318 DArT markers in two subpopulations of five CIMMYT elite spring wheat yield trials and found LD decay around 40 cM. Therefore, finding large LD blocks in this study was not unexpected for the small number of pedigrees, selection pressure placed on these lines for various characteristics by the breeding program, and the backcrossing scheme used to generate the populations. However, using a collection of diverse elite accessions could reduce the LD blocks, as was seen by Maccaferri et al. (2011) in their study. Extending LD in self-pollinated crops, especially in backcross-derived inbred lines from a limited number of crosses, reduces the chance of finding tightly linked markers to the QTL of interest but eliminates the necessity of applying a large number of markers on the population. Thus, in these types of populations, finding the QTL might be possible by assaying just a few Single Sequence Repeats (SSR) markers 10 to 20 cM apart on each chromosome. The result of our association mapping analysis showed the QKT and the KT method were the best for finding the QTL in highly structured and related breeding populations. In the subpopulations, such as Tun34 and Tun7 crosses, the linear mixed model that takes the structure and kinship into account was found to be the best. The PKT was better than the QKT method as small populations under selection pressure deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which may not affect PCA but can affect structure matrix (Q). The results show that replacing the K matrix in the QK and PK models with KT improves the power of the association analysis by 2-fold. Stich et al. (2008) also proposed that the mixed model approach using a kinship matrix estimated by REML is better than marker-based kinship estimates underlying the studies of Yu et al. (2006). Despite the availability of pedigree information, the pedigree method (G) did not perform the same as other methods and was only better than Na\xc3\xafve model. The QTL analysis on Tun34\xc3\x97Lebsock population identified a major QTL, previously not reported in durum wheat, on chromosome 5BL (hereby designated as Qfhs.ndsu-5BL) explaining between 14.6 and 18.1% of genetic variation (H2 = 0.81). Classical QTL analysis corroborated the result of association mapping for this QTL. This further indicates that the mixed models association analysis applied here identified the major QTL with high allele frequency in the population. The highly structured population after several rounds of selection may reduce frequency of the allele with minor effects, especially when those selections are in favor of agronomics traits and not only FHB resistance. These would reduce the power of genome-wide association mapping to detect those QTL (Long and Langley 1999). In the case of FHB resistance where multiple genes with moderate effects are involved, genome-wide association mapping would fail to find these genes, especially when they are present in only one or a few subpopulations. Despite this drawback, potential QTL on chromosomes 3AS, 3BS, and 6BL by LD analysis were also identified but could not be confirmed by the pFDR test. Although an adjustment for multiple comparisons seems to be necessary for association mapping analysis to eliminate the false positives (Sabatti et al. 2003), a high stringent FDR threshold can lead to unexpected false negative errors as well (Park and Mori 2010). Focusing on at the Tun34 panel alone, similar pFDR for wPt-0054 (5BL) and tPt-6487 (3BS) is noted. In the entire panel, the Q value for wPt-5118 from 5BL is even slightly higher than the Q value for wPt-6467 from 3BS (Table 2). Therefore, it is very likely that another QTL for FHB resistance on chromosome 3BS exists in these populations. This was no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 true for other significant QTL, such as 1B, 2A, 3A, 4A, 6B, 7A, or 7B, which could not be confirmed by pFDR. As the associated markers from 3AS and 7BL regions were monomorphic in the Tun34\xc3\x97Lebsock population, their allele frequencies could not be determined, and the Q value was nonsignificant. Therefore wPt-9369 from 3AS or wPt-4025 from 7BL could be interesting markers for future FHB studies in Tunisian lines. The locations of these QTL are in the approximate location of Qfhs.ndsu-3AS found in T. turgidum L. var. dicoccoides (Otto et al. 2002) and the 7BL QTL found for Type II resistance in spring wheat population (Yang et al. 2005). Surprisingly, given the lack of connection between our material and the Chinese hexaploid wheat resistance sources, the location of tPt-6487 (3BS) is in the approximate location of the major gene for FHB resistance fhb1 identified in later material (Cuthbert et al. 2006). There is also the possibility of having a QTL influencing FHB resistance (tPt-1041 and wPt-4984) on chromosome 2A from the Kruskal-Wallis test conducted in our classical QTL and association mapping analyses but not confirmed by pFDR. This region is in approximate location of the 2A QTL found by Garvin et al. (2009), which may mask the magnitude of the resistance from 5BL QTL. Recently, Garvin et al. (2009) proposed the presence of a genomic region on chromosome 2A of wild emmer wheat that increases the FHB severity in durum wheat. Here the Tun18 and Tun7 both carry the 5BL and 3BL resistance QTL and seem not to carry the 2A susceptibility QTL (Figure 4). Therefore, both show good levels of Type II resistance (Figure 2). On the other hand, Tun34 and Tun36 both have only the 3BS resistance QTL but potentially carry the 2A susceptibility QTL and show a moderate level of FHB resistance (Figure 2). The majority of durum cultivars also show similar genotype for this susceptibility region. Thus, this finding not only further corroborates the result of Garvin et al. (2009) but also identifies the path for developing more resistant durum varieties. The influence of Qfhs.ndsu-3AS in the T. dicoccoides accession \xe2\x80\x98FA-15-3\xe2\x80\xb2 (Syn. \xe2\x80\x98Israel A\xe2\x80\x99) was not revealed until elimination of the suppression activity of the 2A QTL by using the chromosome substitution lines (Stack et al. 2002). The effect of the suppressor gene is so adverse that, despite the presence of the 3A QTL for FHB resistance, the overall phenotypic reaction of FA-15-3 is highly susceptible (Garvin et al. 2009). Pyramiding the QTL for FHB resistance in durum wheat background would not be helpful unless we have counter selection against 2A QTL. This study illustrates the advantage of QTL mapping in validating the association mapping result as recently proposed by Brachi et al. (2010) in Arabidopsis. The presence of 5BL QTL was confirmed by both association and classical QTL mapping. The presence of 3BS QTL in the populations analyzed here needs further confirmation by either increasing the size of the populations or developing validation material. Controlling the false positives and negatives for the highly structured, advanced population studied here would always be a challenge, especially when there is selection in favor of some other agronomic traits. Detecting QTL with minor effects, low frequencies, and allelic interaction (i.e. epistasis) would be a challenge in association mapping (Hall et al. 2010). The analysis presented here indicates that association mapping of complicated traits inherited quantitatively and influenced by environment, such as resistance to FHB, in highly structured breeding populations is possible. The number of false positives was very low in our association analysis. This also indicates that the linear mixed model considering the structure (Q or P) and the kinship matrix estimated by REML (KT) would be good models for association mapping in a mixture of wheat populations from different breeding programs. The possibility exists of having false negative associations when dealing with a trait of complex inheritance controlled by multiple genes each having moderate effects. This can be accounted for by increasing the number of populations resulting from each cross. Zhu et al. (2008) recommend a large sample size (more than 250) to obtain high power to detect genetic effect of moderate size. We recommend association mapping with multiple subpopulations having more than 100 lines (in F5 or F6 generation) before any other selection, except for the trait of interest, is placed on them. Working with different subpopulations derived from multiple resistance sources would increase the probability of finding different resistance QTL in a single experiment. Ten out of the 22 QTL found so far for FHB resistance are associated to plant height (Buerstmayr et al. 2009). Therefore selection in the favor of short plants would reduce the frequency of the alleles for FHB resistance in breeding populations by about 45%. The results of our study indicate the power of genome-wide association mapping in finding QTL for FHB resistance in highly structured breeding populations. The Qfhs.ndsu-5BL found in this study was further validated by classical QTL mapping, emphasizing again the effectiveness of mixed model association mapping for a complex trait such as FHB resistance. Replacing the K matrix in the QK and PK models with KT improved the power of QTL detection in backcross-derived inbred lines, which was also indicated by Stich et al. (2008) in soft winter wheat inbred lines. The 3BS QTL found in this study, which has been located in the approximate location of fhb1 gene, would eliminate the need to introduce the gene from hexaploid Chinese sources, which have not been successful in developing released varieties. Additionally, the confirmation of a 2A QTL for susceptibility (or suppressor of resistant) to FHB emphasizes the need to devise a better strategy for improving FHB resistance in durum wheat by elimination of this locus.

An understanding of the global effects of CS will provide insight into disease mechanisms and can guide the development of therapeutics and lifestyle changes to ameliorate their effects. To identify cellular functions important for the response to carbonyl stress, multiple genome-wide genetic screens were performed using two known inducers of CS. We found that different cellular functions were required for resistance to stress induced by methylglyoxal (MG) and glyoxal (GLY). Specifically, we demonstrate the importance of macromolecule catabolism processes for resistance to MG, confirming and extending known mechanisms of MG toxicity, including modification of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Combining our results with related studies that examined the effects of ROS allowed a comprehensive view of the diverse range of cellular functions affected by both oxidative and carbonyl stress. To understand how these diverse cellular functions interact, we performed a quantitative epistasis analysis by creating multimutant strains from those individual genes required for glyoxal resistance. This analysis allowed us to define novel glyoxal-dependent genetic interactions. In summary, using multiple genome-wide approaches provides an effective approach to dissect the poorly understood effects of glyoxal in vivo. These data, observations, and comprehensive dataset provide 1) a comprehensive view of carbonyl stress, 2) a resource for future studies in other cell types, and 3) a demonstration of how inexpensive cell-based assays can identify complex gene-environment toxicities.A hallmark of aging and its attendant ailments is the accumulation of DNA lesions, oxidized proteins, and carbonylated proteins and lipids (Beckman and Ames 1998; Harman 1981; Kujoth et al. 2005; Oliver et al. 1987; Stadtman 1992). It is well-documented that these defects are caused by reactive molecules such as superoxide anions (O2\xe2\x88\x92), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxy radicals (OH) formed as by-products of cellular metabolism (Barrera et al. 2008; Bertram and Hass 2008; Shringarpure and Davies 2002; Stadtman 2006). Less well-studied but no less consequential are the effects of carbonyl stress created by reactive carbonyl compounds (RCC), such as glyoxal, 3DG (3-deoxyglucosone) and methylglyoxal (MG). Glyoxal is formed by lipid and DNA oxidative degradation as well as via autoxidation of glycolaldehyde (Benov and Fridovich 1998). MG is a by-product of metabolic processes, including threonine catabolism (Murata et al. 1986) and lipid peroxidation (Poli et al. 1985). MG can also arise enzymatically during glycolysis (O\xe2\x80\x99Brien et al. 2005; Thornalley 1996). In addition, diverse environmental sources, such as cigarette smoke and automobile exhaust, are abundant sources of carbonyls (O\xe2\x80\x99Brien et al. 2005; Saint-Jalm and Moree-Testa 1980; Zervas et al. 2002). The widespread thermal processing of food can result in MG and other aldehydes (Nemet et al. 2006; Wells-Knecht et al. 1995). Advanced glycation end products (AGE) arising from carbonyl stress are thought to contribute to chronic diseases, such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemia/reperfusion, and Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease (Ellis 2007). Understanding the result of carbonyl stress is an essential first step to characterize the impacts of CS stress on cell physiology.

Identifying the cellular functions necessary for providing resistance to these toxic molecules will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie diseases associated with CS and could suggest therapeutic interventions. Methylglyoxal, glyoxal, nicotinamide, isonicotinamide, and aminoguanidine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Nicotinamide and isonicotinamide were dissolved in sterile H2O and filtered sterilized. Yeast deletion strains were obtained from the yeast deletion collection. ORF-containing plasmids, listed in Table S5, were obtained from Charlie Boone or constructed by gap-repair (Oldenburg et al. 1997). Yeast transformations were performed using the standard lithium acetate method (Gietz et al. 1995) and selected synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (SCM URA\xe2\x88\x92). For growth curve analysis, individual strains were inoculated into 100 \xce\xbcl of YPD or SCM URA\xe2\x88\x92 and grown to saturation for \xe2\x88\xbc20 h at 30\xc2\xb0C. Overnight cultures were resuspended by shaking for 15 min, diluted into 100 \xce\xbcl of media in 96-well plates, and grown in Tecan GENios microplate readers for 24 h. The growth rate of each culture was monitored by measuring the OD600 every 15 min as previously described (Giaever et al. 2004). Doubling-time calculations and area under growth curve (AUGC) analysis were performed as previously described (Hoon et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2005b). We used AUGC analysis for Figure 1B, as we found that this method more accurately captured the fitness of strains under severe growth inhibition (>50% inhibition). AUGC was calculated uniformly over a 24 h window from the start of the experiment. For lower levels of growth inhibition, doubling time during the exponential growth phase was used for fitness comparisons. Methylgloxal and glyoxal inhibit yeast growth. A) Chemical structure of methylglyoxal and glyoxal. B) Growth curve analysis for measuring the fitness of wild-type (HO) strain in glyoxal (left) and methylglyoxal (right) in the presence (black bars) and absence of 20 mM aminoguanidine (white bars). Fitness was quantified using area under growth curve and normalized to growth in YPD \xc2\xb1 SD (n = 3). Growth inhibition caused by aminoguanidine in the absence of glyoxal and methylglyoxal is discussed in the text. C) Fitness of deletion strains in methylglyoxal and glyoxal \xc2\xb1 SD (n = 3) analyzed by growth curve analysis. Strains selected were deficient in genes previously shown to be important for resistance to methylglyoxal stress in yeast. D) Heatmap representing significant GO terms of strains identified to be significantly sensitive (false discovery rate < 0.05) to methylglyoxal and glyoxal by pooled fitness screens. For comparison, we included strains identified to be sensitive to oxidants hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), linoleic acid 13-hydroperoxide (LoaOOH), menadione, and diamide by a previous study (Thorpe et al. 2004). The heatmap is colored according to the P value of each GO term. MSP and DSP screens were performed as previously described (Hoon et al. 2008) with the modification that only the homozygous deletion strains were screened against both methylglyoxal and glyoxal. For DSP, glyoxal was screened at 20 mM and methylglyoxal was screened at 8 mM for 5 and 20 generations. For MSP, yeast genomic library transformants were grown for 20 generations in glyoxal (40 mM) and supplemented with isonicotinamide (25 mM) where indicated. Methods for pooled growth, OD monitoring, automatic cell dilution, and cell harvesting were performed as previously described (Pierce et al. 2006). Competitive screens were designed such that strains that are not resistant should get diluted out over the course of four dilutions every 5 generations. There was variation in terms of the number of starting cells for each strain in the pool, but we normalized this by taking the ratio of the microarray intensities between the control and treated pools. Both DSP and MSP were analyzed using a high-density oligonucleotide tag array manufactured by Affymetrix (Pierce et al. 2006). For DSP, barcode probe intensities were extracted and processed as previously described (Pierce et al. 2006). Each array was mean-normalized and the fold change (log2 control/treatment) was calculated by comparison with a set of control arrays. At least two biological replicates were carried out for each treatment condition. The log2 ratios of both tags were averaged to generate a single score for each gene for use in the DSP-MSP plots. We used rank product analysis (Breitling et al. 2004) to identify strains that were significantly sensitive to either methylglyoxal or glyoxal. A false discovery rate cutoff of 0.05 was used. The list of sensitive strains can be found in Table S1 and Table S2. For the glyoxal deletion resistance screen, the homozygous deletion pools were screened and processed as described above. The results are presented in Table S3. For MSP, ORF probe intensities were extracted and processed in the same way as the barcode probes. Each ORF is represented by at least two probes, and the log2 ratios of each probe were averaged to generate a single score for each gene. To identify each suppressor locus, the log2 ratio of intensities were ordered by genomic location of each ORF and analyzed using a sliding window to identify loci that have at least two adjacent ORFs with log2 ratios \xe2\x89\xa5 1.6. GO analysis was performed using GOstats (Falcon and Gentleman 2007), a bioconductor package written in R. We assessed genetic interactions among a subset of genes that confer resistance to glyoxal by generating multiple combinations of double-deletion strains for quantitative fitness analysis (St. Onge et al. 2007). MATa haploids deletion strains were obtained from the yeast deletion collection, and MAT\xce\xb1 haploids deletion strains were obtained from Charlie Boone. Double-deletion strains were constructed by the synthetic genetic array (SGA) protocol with minor modifications using a Singer RoToR HDA (Singer Instruments, Somerset, UK) (Stansfield and Stark 2007; Tong and Boone 2006). Approximately 800 double-deletion mutants were constructed among 15 deletion strains that were sensitive to glyoxal and 24 deletion strains that were resistant to glyoxal. Single-deletion strains with the same drug resistance cassette (Kanr-Natr and Natr-Kanr) as the double-mutant strains were constructed using the HO-deletion strain as a query strain. In MATa haploids, genes were replaced with a kanamycin resistance marker gene (Kanr), and in MAT\xce\xb1 haploids, genes were replaced with a nourseothricin resistance marker gene (Natr). This method allowed each double-deletion gene pair to be constructed twice (Kanr-Natr and Natr-Kanr) independently. Fitness values between each gene pair were highly correlated (R2 = 0.92). The fitness of strains was determined in the presence and absence of glyoxal. One double mutant (\xce\x94hog1\xce\x94ccw12) could not be constructed because the genes in the pair were genetically linked. Fitness values between each gene pair were highly correlated (Figure 4B, R2 = 0.92), demonstrating the reproducibility of the assay. Strains for which fitness values of Kanr-Natr double-deletion strains differed from that of the Natr- Kanr deletion strains (|Wxy-Wyx|/ > 0.2) were filtered and not used in the analysis. Deletion strains arrayed on YPD/agar were inoculated into 96-well plates containing 100 \xce\xbcl of YPD using a Singer RoToR HDA (Singer Instruments). Cultures were grown to saturation for 20 h at 30\xc2\xb0C and stored at 4\xc2\xb0C for 24\xe2\x80\x9348 h. The cells were then resuspended by shaking for 15 min. Cultures were diluted into 100 \xce\xbcl volumes in 96-well plates using the Singer RoToR HDA and grown in Tecan GENios microplate readers for 30 h at 30\xc2\xb0C. The growth rate of each culture was monitored by measuring the OD600 every 15 min. The doubling time (D) was calculated exactly as previously described (St. Onge et al. 2007). The fitness of each deletion strain was calculated as the ratio of the doubling time of the parental wild-type strain divided by that of the mutant. We quantified the genetic interaction between each gene pair using a multiplicative model. If a strain deleted for gene x has a fitness of Wx and a strain deleted for gene y has a fitness of Wy, then the double mutant strain is expected to have a fitness (Wxy) of Wx \xc3\x97 Wy. We measured the deviation \xce\xb5xy from this expectation, where \xce\xb5xy = Wxy \xe2\x80\x93 Wx \xc3\x97 Wy. For each gene pair, the \xce\xb5xy values for each Kanr-Natr and Natr-Kanr were averaged and used to generate the heatmap. MG is a potent inhibitor of yeast growth (Aguilera and Prieto 2001; Aguilera et al. 2005; Bito et al. 1997; Inoue and Kimura 1996; Inoue et al. 1998; Maeta et al. 2005). Using a quantitative fitness assay, we quantified the growth inhibition for MG and glyoxal (Figure 1A). The IC50 for MG is 8.6 mM (for S. cerevisiae strain BY4743), approximately 5-fold less than that for glyoxal (IC50 of 45.5 mM) (Figure 1B). Aminoguanidine (AG), a \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-dicarbonyl scavenging agent (Cameron et al. 2005) and known suppressor of carbonyl stress, rescues the growth inhibition caused by both compounds (Figure 1B), suggesting that the cellular effects are specific. In the absence of methylglyoxal or glyoxal treatment with AG (20 mM) inhibits yeast growth, likely due to AG reacting with pyruvate to form a hydrazone adduct at high concentrations (Thornalley 2003); in contrast; the carbonyl compounds modulate this effect. In yeast, the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway regulates osmotic homeostasis (O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke et al. 2002). Previous work has determined that the HOG pathway mediates MG resistance, presumably via promoting the expression of genes involved in MG metabolism (Aguilera et al. 2005; Inoue et al. 1998). One such gene is GLO1, encoding glyoxalase I, an enzyme that converts MG into S-D-lactoylgluthathione in the presence of glutathione (Inoue and Kimura 1996). In contrast, we found glyoxal and MG exert different effects on mutants involved in HOG signaling and glyoxalase activity, suggesting distinct mechanisms of action. We confirmed this with individual growth tests of selected strains in glyoxal and methylglyoxal. For example, strains missing GLO1, GLO2, or GSH1 were more sensitive to MG stress than strains missing HOG1, PBS2, SSK1, or SSK2, whereas the opposite pattern of sensitivities was observed for glyoxal stress (Figure 1C). We used two genome-wide assays: 1) yeast deletion collection to identify genes that confer sensitivity, and 2) an overexpression assay to define genes that confer resistance to CS. Genome-wide fitness profiling showed that glyoxal and MG affect cells very differently. We screened both compounds against a collection of 4700 homozygous deletion strains (Giaever et al. 2002; Giaever et al. 2004; Hillenmeyer et al. 2008; Hoon et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2005b) and identified 458 deletion strains that were significantly sensitive (false discovery rate < 0.05) to either MG or GLY (supporting information, Table S1 and Table S2). Functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of sensitive strains showed distinct requirements for resistance to each compound (Figure 1D). MG-sensitive genes were enriched for protein, mRNA, and DNA metabolic processes, in agreement with the suggested mechanism of action of MG in forming DNA, RNA, and protein adducts (Kalapos 1999). In contrast, glyoxal resistance required genes involved in glucose metabolism and peroxisomal and signal transduction processes. Our study corroborates, on a genome-wide level, previous studies in which MG and glyoxal were shown to exert different effects in vivo [e.g., MG and glyoxal induced distinct signals for MAP family kinases in human endothelial cells (Akhand et al. 2001)]. The effects of MG and glyoxal were also distinct from that observed for other oxidants. We compared GO annotations for genes identified following treatment with other oxidants in a previous study (Thorpe et al. 2004) and found that the effects of oxidative stress are typically broad but specific to each oxidant (Figure 1D). Here, we found that additional functions, beyond those associated with ROS, were important for CS resistance. We found that multiple processes involved in the repair and degradation of damaged cellular macromolecules factor in the CS response. Glyoxal and MG are potent arginine-directed glycating agents and covalently cross-link proteins via modification of arginine residues, leading to protein dysfunction (Rabbani and Thornalley 2008). Protein modification by MG activates ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis (Du et al. 2006). Consistent with this observation was our finding that strains deleted for genes involved in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation (\xe2\x88\x86shp1, \xe2\x88\x86bsd2, \xe2\x88\x86stp22, \xe2\x88\x86doa4, \xe2\x88\x86swm1, \xe2\x88\x86bst1, \xe2\x88\x86cdc26, \xe2\x88\x86rad6, \xe2\x88\x86eps1, \xe2\x88\x86 rtt101, \xe2\x88\x86grr1, \xe2\x88\x86vps25, \xe2\x88\x86def1, \xe2\x88\x86doa1, \xe2\x88\x86 snf7, \xe2\x88\x86 srn2, \xe2\x88\x86vps36, \xe2\x88\x86ubx2, \xe2\x88\x86ubx4, \xe2\x88\x86vps20, \xe2\x88\x86ydj1, \xe2\x88\x86snf8, \xe2\x88\x86vps28, and \xe2\x88\x86bro1) were sensitive to MG. For glyoxal, the requirement for ubiquitin-related pathways was less pronounced, with fewer identified strains (\xe2\x88\x86reg1, \xe2\x88\x86doa4, \xe2\x88\x86ubc8, \xe2\x88\x86 jem1, and \xe2\x88\x86ydj1). Together, the MG and GLY results demonstrate that protein catabolism plays a major role in detoxifying glycated proteins. Besides producing protein adducts, methylglyoxal also reacts with guanine bases in RNA and DNA (Kang et al. 1996; Murata-Kamiya and Kamiya 2001). Because messenger RNA (mRNA) quality control is essential, we expected to uncover gene deletion strains involved in mRNA metabolism. The first step in mRNA decay is deadenylation, followed by mRNA degradation either by decapping followed by 5\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x80\xb2 decay or by 3\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x86\x925\xe2\x80\xb2 decay (Garneau et al. 2007). As expected, several strains deficient in deadenylation (\xe2\x88\x86ccr4, \xe2\x88\x86pop2, and \xe2\x88\x86not5), decapping and 5\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x80\xb2 decay (\xe2\x88\x86dhh1,\xe2\x88\x86pat1,\xe2\x88\x86lsm6, \xe2\x88\x86lsm1, and \xe2\x88\x86lsm7) and 3\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x86\x925\xe2\x80\xb2 decay (\xe2\x88\x86ski8, \xe2\x88\x86ski7, \xe2\x88\x86ski3, and \xe2\x88\x86ski2) were sensitive to methylglyoxal. Furthermore, multiple strains involved in DNA repair (\xe2\x88\x86mms4, \xe2\x88\x86rad18, \xe2\x88\x86rpn4, \xe2\x88\x86rad59, \xe2\x88\x86rad57, \xe2\x88\x86rad55, \xe2\x88\x86hpr1, \xe2\x88\x86mus81, \xe2\x88\x86rad51, \xe2\x88\x86rad4, \xe2\x88\x86rad6, \xe2\x88\x86rpb9, \xe2\x88\x86rad54, \xe2\x88\x86srs2, \xe2\x88\x86def1, \xe2\x88\x86doa1, \xe2\x88\x86rad5, \xe2\x88\x86mms22, \xe2\x88\x86rad52, \xe2\x88\x86rad14, \xe2\x88\x86mre11, \xe2\x88\x86tho2, \xe2\x88\x86rad50, \xe2\x88\x86snf2, \xe2\x88\x86rad1, and \xe2\x88\x86mms1) were also sensitive to MG. In contrast, DNA repair and mRNA decay pathways were not required for glyoxal resistance, even at higher doses (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that MG damages cellular macromolecules more potently than glyoxal. Having identified numerous CS-sensitive deletion strains, we asked which deletion strains manifest CS resistance. Such genes can be interpreted as negative regulators of stress resistance. Pooled fitness profiling assays have focused on identifying deletion strains with reduced fitness in experimental conditions, in part because the assay\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic range for assessing resistance is poor [i.e., modest perturbations are used (\xe2\x88\xbcIC10)] and in part because a large amount of the sample is hybridized. To identify resistant strains, we developed an optimized \xe2\x80\x9cresistance screen\xe2\x80\x9d in which the entire pool of deletion strains is treated with a high dose of compound (e.g., IC50) over 20 generations of growth (Figure 2A and Materials and Methods), and a smaller amount of material is hybridized (Figure 2A). This new assay identified bona fide resistant deletion strains. Following treatment with glyoxal at an IC50 concentration, most of the strain-specific TAG intensities were at background levels compared to controls, while those strains that remained constant or increased during the course of the experiment represented glyoxal-resistant strains. Identifying deletion strains resistant to glyoxal stress. A) (left) Schematic of screen used for identifying deletion strains resistant to glyoxal stress. A homozygous deletion pool was grown for 20 generations in 80 mM glyoxal. Barcodes were amplified and hybridized to TAG4 arrays. (right) Strong selection in the presence of glyoxal resulted in selection for strains highly resistant to glyoxal. TAG intensities are mostly at background (gray region) in cells treated with glyoxal compared to control. B) (left) Log2 fold ratio of control/treatment of TAG array results. Negative fold ratios indicate tags that are over-represented in glyoxal selection. Genes mentioned in the text are highlighted in red. (right) Confirmation growth curves of deletion strains resistant to glyoxal. Multiple strains were significantly resistant to glyoxal, and the majority of these strains were confirmed individually (Figure 2B, Table S3). Among these genes, PTC1, a type 2C protein phosphatase that negatively regulates the HOG pathway by dephosphorylating Hog1 (Warmka et al. 2001), and Nbp2, a protein that recruits Ptc1 to the Pbs2-Hog1 complex, provide additional evidence that upregulation of the HOG pathway is required for glyoxal resistance (Mapes and Ota 2004). GO analysis of these resistant deletion strains showed enrichment for intracellular/endosome transport protein metabolic processes and organelle organization (Table S4). To further characterize the effects of glyoxal, we employed a third genome-wide assay. Specifically, we identified multicopy suppressors of glyoxal sensitivity using multicopy suppressor profiling (MSP) to identify genes that confer resistance to compounds when over-represented (Hoon et al. 2008; Rine et al. 1983). During our experiments with deletion resistant screens, we discovered that sir2 deletion mutants displayed resistance to glyoxal. This observation, combined with the well-characterized relationship between Sir2 and NAD metabolism (Blander and Guarente 2004), inspired us to test if nicotinamide, an endogenous inhibitor of Sir2 (Bitterman et al. 2002), would act as a chemical modifier in the glyoxal MSP assay. We found that nicotinamide conferred resistance to glyoxal (Figure 3A) whereas isonicotinamide, an antagonist of nicotinamide inhibition and an activator of Sir2 deacetylase activity (Sauve and Schramm 2004), conferred sensitivity to glyoxal (Figure 3A). Therefore, we mimicked activation of Sir2 using isonicotinamide to amplify the sensitivity of the MSP screen (Figure 3B). We identified multiple suppressors containing genomic DNA that were over-represented in pools grown in glyoxal compared with control (Table 1), and isonicotinamide administration identified additional suppressors. One of the most resistant loci identified was GLO1, the enzyme that metabolizes glyoxal. This observation confirms that this experimental approach can identify relevant genes involved in glyoxal resistance. Several suppressors were confirmed by isogenic tests with wild-type yeast harboring plasmids containing individually cloned ORFs (Figure S1). Sensitized glyoxal suppressor screen. A) Fitness \xc2\xb1 SD (n = 3) of wild-type and SIR2 mutants grown in different glyoxal concentrations with and without supplementing nicotinamide (NAM) and isonicotinamide (IsoNAM) at 5 mM and 25 mM, respectively. B) Schematic of multicopy suppressor screen with glyoxal and isonicotinamide. A pool of yeast strains harboring a genomic library was grown competitively in the presence of control, glyoxal, and glyoxal supplemented with isonicotinamide. Plasmids were isolated and inserts were amplified by PCR and hybridized to ORF probes present on the TAG4 array. Over-represented ORFs in treatment vs. control are identified as candidate suppressors. C) Confirmatory growth curves of individually cloned suppressors identified by MSP. D) Overlap of genes identified by MSP and DSP. MSP genes include genes found in suppressor loci in Table 1. In cases where individual genes were not identified by subcloning, all genes in the suppressor loci were included. Genes that were found in both assays were enriched for components in the osmosensory signaling pathway by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Surprisingly, only 4% (12/287) of genes were identified in both the overexpression-resistance and deletion-sensitivity assays (Figure 3D). There are multiple reasons for this lack of overlap, both biological and technical. These assays were designed to yield orthologous data; e.g., deletion screens are unlikely to identify genes with overlapping or redundant function (Tong et al. 2001). Overexpression screens can identify suppressor genes that are functionally redundant because expression of a single gene can confer resistance. Indeed, we identified several aldehyde reductases that, when overexpressed, behaved this way. GRE3 is an aldehyde reductase that is capable of metabolizing MG and is regulated by the HOG pathway (Aguilera and Prieto 2001; Aguilera et al. 2005). YPR1 is another aldehyde reductase that has high specificity for 2-methylbutyraldehyde (Ford and Ellis 2002). ADH6 is an alcohol dehydrogenase able to detoxify aldehydes in vivo (Larroy et al. 2002). All three genes strongly suppressed glyoxal toxicity in single-strain confirmations (Figure 3C). Although each of these genes was identified by overexpression profiling, none was sensitive to glyoxal as a single-gene deletion (Table S2), reflecting potential functional redundancy and underscoring the benefit of combining the results of multiple assays. Despite the small overlap between loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays, 12 genes where identified in both assays (Figure 3D). These genes were enriched for signal transduction; e.g., three components of the HOG pathway (PBS2, SSK1, and SSK2) were identified. Overexpression of HOG1 conferred resistance to glyoxal (Figure 3C), even though it was not identified by MSP. On the basis of our earlier work, genes that ranked high in both assays were enriched for functions directly related to drug mechanism of action (Hoon et al. 2008); accordingly, we concluded that the HOG pathway is critical for glyoxal resistance, and because mutants in the glyoxalase pathway were much less sensitive (Figure 1C), we suggest that additional effectors of glyoxal resistance are regulated by the HOG pathway. Using the data from the deletion- and overexpression-based screens, we generated a ranked list of sensitive and resistant strains and performed epistasis analysis by systematically creating double mutants between genes involved in CS resistance and measuring their fitness in the presence of glyoxal using high resolution growth curve analysis on the approximately 800 multimutants. Epistasis, defined as the influence of a mutation in one gene on the phenotype of another, can be formalized so that any deviation from the predicted effects of combined mutations can be quantified to derive genetic interaction networks and dissect cellular pathways (Boone et al. 2007; Mani et al. 2008) (St. Onge et al. 2007). All possible combinations of double-deletion strains were constructed for 15 deletion strains sensitive to glyoxal, and all possible combinations between the same 15 sensitive deletion strains and 24 resistant deletion strains were constructed for a total of \xe2\x88\xbc800 double-deletions strains that were screened for fitness in the presence and absence of glyoxal (Figure 4A).We performed the screens at two glyoxal concentrations (5 mM and 10 mM) that were lower than the pooled screen concentration to increase the likelihood of identifying both alleviating and aggravating interactions. Each double mutant was constructed twice, and we found that fitness values between reciprocal gene pairs were highly correlated (Figure 4B). Using fitness values for double- and single-deletion strains, we quantified the genetic interaction (expressed as \xce\xb5) between gene pairs, where \xce\xb5xy = Wxy \xe2\x80\x93 Wx \xc3\x97 Wy. By performing our screens at multiple drug doses with both resistant and sensitive mutant strains (using high-resolution growth curves), we could identify subtle genetic interactions ranging from aggravation (\xce\xb5 < 0) to suppression (\xce\xb5 > 0). For example, in 5 mM glyoxal, loss of RPE1 severely aggravated glyoxal sensitivity of a \xce\x94pbs2 strain, whereas in 10 mM glyoxal, loss of ERV14 completely suppressed glyoxal sensitivity of a \xce\x94pbs2 strain (Figure 4C). The distribution of \xce\xb5 values showed that a greater number of genetic interactions were uncovered when the screen was performed in the presence of stress (St. Onge et al. 2007) (Figure 4D). Quantitative epistasis analysis. A) Double deletion strains were constructed between 15 glyoxal sensitive strains and 24 glyoxal resistant strains. Each double mutant was constructed independently twice using two different markers (Kanr and Natr). B) Fitness correlation between reciprocal double-deletion mutants for each gene pair in the presence and absence of glyoxal. The correlation coefficient (R) and the best fitting line are shown. C) Examples of double-deletion mutants displaying aggravating and alleviating genetic interaction in the presence of glyoxal. \xce\x94pbs2\xce\x94rpe1 mutants were strongly aggravating in 5 mM glyoxal with \xce\xb5 = \xe2\x88\x920.66, and \xce\x94pbs2\xce\x94erv14 were strongly alleviating (suppression) in 10 mM glyoxal with \xce\xb5 = 0.44. D) Distribution of \xce\xb5 values for all double mutant pairs grown in YPD (blue) or 10 mM glyoxal (red). We summarized all the epistatic tests as a heatmap, with strains ordered by hierarchical clustering of their \xce\xb5 values (Figure 5). Genes of related function clustered together; e.g., HOG1 and PBS2 were highly correlated (r = 0.98) in both YPD and YPD + glyoxal. In contrast, other pairs of genes shared genetic interactions only in the presence of glyoxal. RPN10, which encodes the 19S regulatory particle (RP) of the 26S proteasome, clusters with SPT3 and SPT8, members of the SAGA transcriptional regulatory complex. It was recently shown that the 19S RP alters SAGA and stimulates its interaction with transcription activators (Lee et al. 2005a). We also note that a strain deleted for GCN5, the catalytic subunit of SAGA, was resistant to glyoxal (Table S3) and RPE1, an epimerase with roles in the non-oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway that has been shown to display increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (Juhnke et al. 1996). In the presence of glyoxal, RPE1 clusters with TKL1, a transketolase that functions in the same pathway (Walfridsson et al. 1995), and both are involved in NADPH production, important for protection against reactive oxidative stress. Because alleviating interactions arise when a mutation in one gene impairs the function of a pathway, thereby masking the effects of mutations in other members of the same pathway (Mani et al. 2008), the alleviation observed between RPE1 and TKL1 (\xce\xb5 = 0.15) suggests that the two genes operate in the same pathway. In contrast, mutants of both RPE1 and TKL1 shared aggravating interactions with mutants of IRA2, SSD1, PPZ1, HOG1, and PBS2, indicating that they buffer glyoxal resistance via distinct pathways. Thus, our epistasis analysis of over 800 multimutants detected known relationships between genes in the same pathway and uncovered novel relationships between pathways that were detected only under glyoxal-induced stress. Genetic interaction profiles predict pathways. Genes hierarchically clustered (Pearson correlation) according to similar patterns of genetic interaction (\xce\xb5) for growth in YPD (left) and in 10 mM glyoxal (right).

 the \xce\xb5 value of each double mutant: yellow for aggravating interactions (\xce\xb5 < 0) and blue for alleviating interactions (\xce\xb5 > 0). Genes identified as sensitive to glyoxal when deleted singly are highlighted in red, and genes identified as resistant to glyoxal when deleted singly are highlighted in green. Erv14 is a transmembrane protein found in the ER and the early Golgi compartment involved in COPII cargo selection (Nakanishi et al. 2007; Powers and Barlowe 1998; Powers and Barlowe 2002). Our genetic interaction analysis showed that Erv14 clusters with Fps1, a membrane channel involved in glycerol export. Deletion of both genes resulted in complete suppression of glyoxal sensitivity of \xce\x94hog1 and \xce\x94pbs2 mutants, demonstrating that both FPS1 and ERV14 function downstream of the HOG pathway (Figure 6A). Fps1 is known to mediate the uptake of acetic acid, arsenite, and antimonite, and downregulation of Fps1 activity via Hog1 confers resistance to the same toxins (Mollapour and Piper 2007; Thorsen et al. 2006; Wysocki et al. 2001). On the basis of the degree of resistance conferred by loss of FPS1 to both \xce\x94hog1 and \xce\x94pbs2 mutants, we speculate that glyoxal may enter the cell via the Fps1 plasma membrane channel. Because loss of Fps1 also suppressed glyoxal sensitivity in other mutants (e.g., \xce\x94tma108, \xce\x94tkl1, and \xce\x94ppz1) at much higher glyoxal concentrations (Figure S2), it is also possible that Erv14 regulates transport of Fps1 to the plasma membrane. To test the hypothesis that loss of Erv14 renders cells resistant to glyoxal by disrupting plasma membrane localization of Fps1, we examined a GFP-tagged allele of Fps1 and found that, in fact, localization of Fps1 to the plasma membrane was disrupted in \xce\x94erv14 mutants (Figure 6B). This observation confirmed that epistatic studies derived from the genome-wide screens can form the basis of specific, testable hypotheses. Erv14 deletion abolishes requirement for HOG pathway. A) Growth curve of double mutants \xce\x94hog1\xce\x94erv14 (top row) and \xce\x94pbs2\xce\x94erv14 (bottom row) in YPD and glyoxal (10 mM). B) Live cell imaging of Fps1 distribution. Wild-type (BY4741) and \xce\x94erv14 cells expressing C-terminally GFP-tagged Fps1 from the pUG23-FPS1GFP plasmid were grown in synthetic media lacking methionine. DNA staining was performed with Hoescht stain 33258. Characterization of chemical stresses, such as MG and glyoxal, is challenging because numerous pathways (e.g., stress response and chemical detoxification) are involved. To address these challenges, we employed several unbiased chemical genomic assays. First, using competitive fitness measurements, we defined the genetic determinants of CS resistance and then determined the relationships between these genes in the presence of CS using multimutant analysis (St. Onge et al. 2007). The result is a comprehensive view of the physiology that underlies the cellular response to CS. We show that the genetic requirements for MG and glyoxal resistance are distinct and that different carbonyl stresses require distinct genetic cohorts for cell survival. We demonstrate the importance of macromolecule catabolism for resistance to MG, confirming and extending known mechanisms of MG toxicity. Downregulation of the glucose repression pathway was also implicated in the control of glyoxal resistance, specifically MIG1, SNF1, and MIG2 (Table 1). The effects of glyoxal on the cell are pervasive and deleterious, yet poorly understood. Integrating our observations, we suggest a model of glyoxal resistance in yeast (Figure 7) with the intention of generating testable hypotheses for follow-up studies. In this model, glyoxal detoxification is mediated via multiple reductases, GRE3, ADH6, YPR1 and GLO1, which were identified via multicopy suppression to confer glyoxal resistance. A functioning HOG pathway is critical for glyoxal resistance by regulating the expression of GLO1, which encodes a glyoxal detoxifying enzyme. In addition to GLO1, our data suggest that other downstream effectors participate in mediating glyoxal resistance. One candidate effector is FPS1, a plasma membrane channel that is targeted for endocytic degradation by Hog1 phosphorylation (Mollapour and Piper 2007). Deletion of FPS1 abolishes the sensitivity of HOG pathway mutants to glyoxal, similar to that observed for acetic acid, arsenite, and antimonite (Mollapour and Piper 2007; Thorsen et al. 2006; Wysocki et al. 2001). Several mutants responsible for ER and early Golgi transport were observed to be resistant to glyoxal. In particular, loss of ERV14 also abolishes sensitivity of HOG pathway mutants. We speculate that this is due to defective localization of Fps1 to the cell surface with a concomitant reduction in glyoxal levels. One way to test this model would be to measure the intracellular glyoxal concentrations during treatment of wild-type and mutant strains. Model for glyoxal resistance. We highlight four main pathways necessary for glyoxal resistance. The HOG pathway positively regulates the expression of GLO1 and negatively regulates FPS1 in conferring glyoxal resistance. We hypothesize that the HOG pathway targets Fps1 for degradation, thereby reducing glyoxal import. Moreover, we hypothesize that transport of Fps1 to the cell surface is mediated by Erv14 and associated proteins. We also identified two other mechanisms by which glyoxal resistance is managed: 1) downregulation of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway and 2) glyoxal metabolism. In summary, we show the broad range of specific cellular functions that are important for carbonyl stress resistance. Using multiple genome-wide approaches, we were able to comprehensively identify multiple genetic requirements for glyoxal stress resistance. Furthermore, a quantitative epistasis analysis comprising \xe2\x88\xbc800 strains allowed us to uncover glyoxal-dependent genetic interactions. These data comprise the first genome-wide assessment of the role of gene dose and of epistatic relationships with respect to their role in the response to carbonyl stress. Because many of the pathways affected by carbonyl stress are well conserved, our observations and their underlying datasets provide a resource for future studies in yeast and other cell types. For example, aging, while not typically thought of as a stress-related disorder, manifests many of the features of carbonyl accumulation\xe2\x80\x93related toxicity. Accordingly, comprehensive gene dose studies may serve as a cost-effective and comprehensive approach for toxicity assessment toward achieving the goal of transforming both general and environmental health (Collins et al. 2008).

7,"['Chengsong Zhu', 'Xianran Li', 'Jianming Yu']","August 8, 2011.","Integrating Rare-Variant Testing, Function Prediction, and Gene Network in Composite Resequencing-Based Genome-Wide Association Studies (CR-GWAS)","b'High-density array-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are complemented by exome sequencing and whole-genome resequencing-based association studies. Here we present a composite resequencing-based genome-wide association study (CR-GWAS) strategy that systematically exploits collective biological information and analytical tools for a robust analysis. We showcased the utility of this strategy by using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resequencing data. Bioinformatic predictions of biological function alteration at each locus were integrated into the process of association testing of both common and rare variants for complex traits with a suite of statistics. Significant signals were then filtered with a priori candidate loci generated from genome database and gene network models to obtain a posteriori candidate loci. A probabilistic gene network (AraNet) that interrogates network neighborhoods of genes was then used to expand the filtering power to examine the significant testing signals. Using this strategy, we confirmed the known true positives and identified several new promising associations. Promising genes (AP1, FCA, FRI, FLC, FLM, SPL5, FY, and DCL2) were shown to control for flowering time through either common variants or rare variants within a diverse set of Arabidopsis accessions. Although many of these candidate genes were cloned earlier with mutational studies, identifying their allele variation contribution to overall phenotypic variation among diverse natural accessions is critical. Our rare allele testing established a greater number of connections than previous analyses in which this issue was not addressed. More importantly, our results demonstrated the potential of integrating various biological, statistical, and bioinformatic tools into complex trait dissection.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have uncovered hundreds of genetic variants associated with complex human diseases and traits, have revolutionized genetic mapping in humans (Altshuler et al. 2008; Donnelly 2008; Hindorff et al. 2009a) and are being adopted in plants (Atwell et al. 2010; Brachi et al. 2010). The underlying rationale for GWAS, known as the common disease\xe2\x80\x93common variant (CDCV) hypothesis (Risch and Merikangas 1996), is that common phenotypic variation is caused by common genetic variants. But genes implicated in GWAS often account for only a small fraction of the heritable variation of a phenotype (Hindorff et al. 2009b; Manolio et al. 2009; Mccarthy et al. 2008). Rare functional alleles are among the likely culprits (Pritchard 2001; Reich and Lander 2001) because power to detect association is a function of allele frequency and rare variants are underpowered when sample sizes are limited. In some cases, researchers often exclude single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that have a minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 5% from association studies (Nordborg et al. 2005; Yu et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2007). However, recent studies on the frequency of human alleles and their predicted functional effects imply that rare variants (i.e., MAF < 5%) are more likely to be functional than common variants (Gorlov et al. 2008), and multiple rare frequency variants together may explain a certain proportion of the genetic variation for certain complex diseases (Bodmer and Bonilla 2008; Johansen et al. 2010; Schork et al. 2009). Most of the GWAS in human genetics so far were based on single common variant analyses (Manolio 2010), although it has been shown that multiple rare variants together may account for a few proportions of phenotypic variation for complex diseases (Bansal et al. 2010). But these studies with a focus on rare variants were the analysis of one or several candidate genes, and resequenced-based association studies are still not available. Pathway-based approaches have recently been developed to use prior biological knowledge on gene function to facilitate the analysis of GWAS datasets (Wang et al. 2010). Up to now, a comprehensive approach that combines statistical analyses of common and rare variants, biological network, function prediction, and other existing methods has not been proposed. Several notable, critical advances in relevant areas make it feasible to conduct a composite analysis of both common and rare variants beyond the single SNP analysis. First, with next-generation sequencing technologies, exome sequencing or whole-genome resequencing is now possible (Ansorge 2009; Ng et al. 2010; Shendure and Ji 2008). Second, biological functions of nucleotide polymorphisms can be predicted with the context sequence of genes (Kumar et al. 2009; Ramensky et al. 2002) and have been examined in Arabidopsis and rice (Gunther and Schmid 2010). Third, attention has been given to the rare allele issue (Bodmer and Bonilla 2008; Cohen et al. 2004; Nejentsev et al. 2009), and some specific statistics have been developed to assess the significance of rare variants (Li and Leal 2008; Madsen and Browning 2009; Morgenthaler and Thilly 2007; Morris and Zeggini 2010). Fourth, genome databases and gene networks have been developed to aid the search and confirmation processes of gene-trait associations (Lee et al. 2010a; Lee et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2010b). Comprehensive association analysis calls for an integration of all these advances (Bodmer and Bonilla 2008). In this study, we designed a composite resequencing-based GWAS (CR-GWAS) strategy to integrate these advances, and we showcased the analysis with an Arabidopsis flowering time dataset (Figure 1). We showed specifically how biological function predictions can be incorporated into testing rare variants and broadly how function prediction, genome database, and network information can be integrated into the process of identifying robust associations. With this approach, we identified both common and rare variants underlying variation of flowering time in Arabidopsis. To date, several GWAS studies with high SNP density have been conducted in plants, including Arabidopsis (Atwell et al. 2010; Brachi et al. 2010), rice (Huang et al. 2010), and maize (Kump et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2011). These two recent Arabidopsis studies, however, used the array-based genotyping approach, and rare variants (i.e., MAF < 5%) accounted for only 4.7% of all the SNP variants, limiting rare variant analysis. The maize studies involved a genetic design that alters the allele frequency in the final nested association mapping population. The resequencing dataset used in the current study includes data described in earlier publications (Nordborg et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2007) and other data of resequenced gene fragments after those publications. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the only resequencing-based data with adequate frequencies of rare variants (50%) for a comprehensive analysis in a plant species for which various tools are available. This provides an opportunity to demonstrate the CR-GWAS strategy, particularly the use of rare variant analysis, function prediction, and gene network, which were not conducted in a previous study (Zhao et al. 2007). It would be interesting to test this strategy again once data are available from the 1001 Genomes Project.'","b'High-density array-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are complemented by exome sequencing and whole-genome resequencing-based association studies. Here we present a composite resequencing-based genome-wide association study (CR-GWAS) strategy that systematically exploits collective biological information and analytical tools for a robust analysis. We showcased the utility of this strategy by using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resequencing data. Bioinformatic predictions of biological function alteration at each locus were integrated into the process of association testing of both common and rare variants for complex traits with a suite of statistics. Significant signals were then filtered with a priori candidate loci generated from genome database and gene network models to obtain a posteriori candidate loci. A probabilistic gene network (AraNet) that interrogates network neighborhoods of genes was then used to expand the filtering power to examine the significant testing signals. Using this strategy, we confirmed the known true positives and identified several new promising associations. Promising genes (AP1, FCA, FRI, FLC, FLM, SPL5, FY, and DCL2) were shown to control for flowering time through either common variants or rare variants within a diverse set of Arabidopsis accessions. Although many of these candidate genes were cloned earlier with mutational studies, identifying their allele variation contribution to overall phenotypic variation among diverse natural accessions is critical. Our rare allele testing established a greater number of connections than previous analyses in which this issue was not addressed. More importantly, our results demonstrated the potential of integrating various biological, statistical, and bioinformatic tools into complex trait dissection. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have uncovered hundreds of genetic variants associated with complex human diseases and traits, have revolutionized genetic mapping in humans (Altshuler et al. 2008; Donnelly 2008; Hindorff et al. 2009a) and are being adopted in plants (Atwell et al. 2010; Brachi et al. 2010). The underlying rationale for GWAS, known as the common disease\xe2\x80\x93common variant (CDCV) hypothesis (Risch and Merikangas 1996), is that common phenotypic variation is caused by common genetic variants. But genes implicated in GWAS often account for only a small fraction of the heritable variation of a phenotype (Hindorff et al. 2009b; Manolio et al. 2009; Mccarthy et al. 2008). Rare functional alleles are among the likely culprits (Pritchard 2001; Reich and Lander 2001) because power to detect association is a function of allele frequency and rare variants are underpowered when sample sizes are limited. In some cases, researchers often exclude single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that have a minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 5% from association studies (Nordborg et al. 2005; Yu et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2007). However, recent studies on the frequency of human alleles and their predicted functional effects imply that rare variants (i.e., MAF < 5%) are more likely to be functional than common variants (Gorlov et al. 2008), and multiple rare frequency variants together may explain a certain proportion of the genetic variation for certain complex diseases (Bodmer and Bonilla 2008; Johansen et al. 2010; Schork et al. 2009). Most of the GWAS in human genetics so far were based on single common variant analyses (Manolio 2010), although it has been shown that multiple rare variants together may account for a few proportions of phenotypic variation for complex diseases (Bansal et al. 2010). But these studies with a focus on rare variants were the analysis of one or several candidate genes, and resequenced-based association studies are still not available.

With this approach, we identified both common and rare variants underlying variation of flowering time in Arabidopsis. Schematic diagram of a composite resequencing-based GWAS (CR-GWAS) strategy that integrates function prediction, genome database, and gene network information, as well as common variant and rare variant testing. To date, several GWAS studies with high SNP density have been conducted in plants, including Arabidopsis (Atwell et al. 2010; Brachi et al. 2010), rice (Huang et al. 2010), and maize (Kump et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2011). These two recent Arabidopsis studies, however, used the array-based genotyping approach, and rare variants (i.e., MAF < 5%) accounted for only 4.7% of all the SNP variants, limiting rare variant analysis. The maize studies involved a genetic design that alters the allele frequency in the final nested association mapping population. The resequencing dataset used in the current study includes data described in earlier publications (Nordborg et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2007) and other data of resequenced gene fragments after those publications. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the only resequencing-based data with adequate frequencies of rare variants (50%) for a comprehensive analysis in a plant species for which various tools are available. This provides an opportunity to demonstrate the CR-GWAS strategy, particularly the use of rare variant analysis, function prediction, and gene network, which were not conducted in a previous study (Zhao et al. 2007). It would be interesting to test this strategy again once data are available from the 1001 Genomes Project. Two resequencing datasets were merged for the current study: one described in earlier publications (Nordborg et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2007) and the other based on resequenced gene fragments after initial publications by Magnus Nordborg\xe2\x80\x99s group (Table S4). Additional Arabidopsis requencing data is available at http://walnut.usc.edu/. These 1275 fragments ranged from 454 bp to 942 bp, representing 0.73 Mb of the genome. The average sequence length is 542 bp. All the reliable alignments involving 1116 genes were sequenced across a panel of 96 Arabidopsis thaliana lines (Nordborg et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2007). A total of 20,810 SNPs were annotated as intergenic, intronic, synonymous, or nonsynonymous to analyze the relationship of allele frequency and function prediction, and then used for association testing. Given the small genome size of Arabidopsis (i.e., about 4% of human genome), the SNP density in this dataset is similar to a study with 500,000-SNP exome or candidate-gene sequence capture in humans. Sixteen traits related to flowering time (Table S1) (Zhao et al. 2007) were used for various association testing of common and rare variants. The 3.74% missing entries for phenotypes were imputed using the clustering method (Scheet and Stephens 2006) because of significant correlations among these traits, and the resulting complete data were normalized for association testing. To integrate statistical analyses, function prediction, and gene network, we designed the CR-GWAS strategy (Figure 1). First, we analyzed the gene fragments with a combination of statistical methods to identify significant tests for gene fragments. Second, we examined whether a priori candidate genes that were significant at the 0.001 significance level across all methods could be confirmed by previous experiments for genes with common variants. Third, for genes with rare variants (i.e., MAF < 5%), we checked whether the number of functional SNPs on the basis of function prediction within gene fragments was greater than or equal to three. We used three as a cutoff to avoid cases of complete linkage disequilibrium between two SNPs with rare alleles. In addition, we examined the congruency across different statistical methods. Fourth, if the tested genes were not in the a priori candidate gene list but were among the top 30 significant tests out of all tests, we searched these genes in the gene network AraNet to verify whether they were connected with a priori candidate genes. The detailed procedures are described in the following sections. A list of 281 a priori candidate genes with annotations related to flowering-related traits were retrieved previously from the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) version 8 (Atwell et al. 2010; Brachi et al. 2010). Twelve additional genes were retrieved from TAIR 9, resulting in a list of 293 a priori candidate genes. Generating the a priori candidate gene list is justified because Arabidopsis has been thoroughly studied as a model organism, and its flowering-time pathways have been well characterized. Thirty-five of these a priori candidate genes overlapped with genes contained in the 1,275 fragments analyzed for association with flowering time\xe2\x80\x93related traits (Table S1 and Table S4). Two approaches based on sequence homology, Polymorphism Phenotype (PolyPhen) (Ramensky et al. 2002) and Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) (Kumar et al. 2009), were used to evaluate the potential impact of nonsynonymous SNPs. Nonsynonymous SNPs result in amino acid substitutions and are more likely than synonymous SNPs to affect the activity of proteins encoded by the genes. For predictions by PolyPhen, SNPs were classified into three categories: benign, possibly damaging, and probably damaging. Benign SNPs were considered as nonfunctional, whereas possibly or probably protein-damaging SNPs were considered functional. The SNPs predicted to be intolerant by SIFT were considered functional, and SNPs predicted to be tolerant were considered nonfunctional. A nonsynonymous change may be either missense or nonsense. A missense change results in a different amino acid, and a nonsense change results in a premature stop codon. All nonsense SNPs were considered functional because they typically result in more damage to protein structure and function than probably damaging SNPs. The MAFs were binned into 20 categories in increments of 2.5%, and the various types of SNPs in different MAF bins were tabulated (Table S6). To estimate the relationship between MAF and the proportion of nonsynonymous SNPs predicted to be protein disturbing, power regression (), logarithmic regression (), and linear regression () were used to fit the binned data. With predictions from PolyPhen, a power regression function of MAF (p), , captured 84.6% of the variation of proportion of functional SNPs; this was higher than logarithmic regression (56.9%) or linear regression (27.2%). Similarly, with predictions from SIFT, a power regression function of MAF (p), , captured 78.3% of the variation, which was higher than logarithmic regression (61.4%) and linear regression (32.2%). We examined the congruency between function predictions by PolyPhen and SIFT. There was highly significant non-independence (P-value = 1.8 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9234) between the two predictions, driven primarily by the large proportion (66%) of SNPs predicted to be benign by PolyPhen and tolerant by SIFT. Because these two programs were developed using different algorithms, this general congruence observed should be satisfactory. The unified mixed model was used to control for population structure and relative kinship (Yu et al. 2006). The vector of phenotypes, y, is modeled as , where \xce\xb2 is a vector of subpopulation effects, i.e., Q (STRUCTURE), nonmetric dimensional scaling (nMDS), or principal component analysis (PCA), and u is a vector of polygene background effects. X contains the coordinates from STRUCTURE, nMDS, and PCA relating y to \xce\xb2; Z is an incidence matrix of ones and zeros relating y to u; and e is a vector of residual effects. The phenotypic covariance matrix is assumed to have the form , where K is an n \xc3\x97 n matrix of relative kinship coefficients that define the degree of genetic covariance between a pair of individuals (Loiselle et al. 1995), I is an n \xc3\x97 n identity matrix,  is the genetic variance attributable to genome-wide effects, and  is the residual variance. As the effects of population structure on phenotypes varied, we compared the model fit of 22 relevant models across 16 different phenotypes using Bayesian Information Criterion (Yu et al. 2006; Zhu and Yu 2009) (Table S2 and Table S3). With the optimal model for each trait, a GRAMMAR approach was taken in which the adjusted phenotype was computed before testing of common and rare variants to reduce the computational load and avoid convergence issues (Aulchenko et al. 2007). For SNPs with MAF greater than 5% (i.e., common variants), a test of association was conducted with adjusted phenotypes by comparing models with and without the specific SNP. For SNPs with MAF less than 5% (i.e., rare variants), the sum test (Li and Leal 2008; Morris and Zeggini 2010) and weighted sum test (Madsen and Browning 2009) were conducted first. A third test, the function-aided sum test, was adapted by incorporating both biological function prediction (Ramensky et al. 2002) and allele frequency into the weighting process (Price et al. 2010). In general, the first step for pooling the rare variants is to choose the appropriate genomic units for analysis. One way is to pursue a moving window analysis in which variants in contiguous, possibly overlapping subregions are tested (Bansal et al. 2010). In our situation, both collapsed and multivariate tests are confined to the fragment because the 1275 resequenced fragments were mostly independent short segments. We required the number of rare variants with a gene fragment to be greater than or equal to three to be included in the analysis. For all three tests, the common model was , where yi is the adjusted phenotype value, \xce\xb20 is the intercept, and \xce\xb21 is the effect of minor allele vs. common allele, and ei is the residual effect. For the sum test, , where m is the number of rare variants in a gene (or fragment) for ith individual, and xij denotes the reference allele count of SNP j in sample i. For the weighted sum test, , where pj is the frequency of jth rare variant and n is the population sample size. For the function-aided sum test, , where Sj is independent of allele frequency and is the average probabilistic score of amino acid change from the allele substitution of jth rare variant, and pjF is the predicted proportion of functional SNPs with the same MAF frequency of jth rare variant. Both Sj and pjF were obtained from the function prediction (Adzhubei et al. 2010; Ramensky et al. 2002). S relates the function class of rare variants to weighting and takes one of three values on the basis of average of delta scores from each category (Table S5): 0.6772 for benign or synonymous, 1.7051 for possibly damaging, and 2.4277 for probably damaging for the Arabidopsis data. The probability score of amino score, pF, relates allele frequency (p) to weighting through the power regression equation described in the previous section, . With S and pF, both predicted biological function and allele frequency distribution were introduced into the statistical testing of the rare variants. For gene fragments with multiple common SNPs, we used the multivariate approach (Pan 2009) in which each variant was assigned the same weight, . For the combined multivariate pooled method, we regarded pooled rare variants (by weighted-sum approach) as individual variants and then applied a multivariate test to analyze groups of variants within a gene fragment. In the current study, one multiple common variant test and three pooled rare variant tests were examined to determine the significance of the gene fragments and compare the performance of these tests. Likelihood ratio (LR) tests were conducted for all individual methods for single SNP, multiple common variant, sum test, weighted sum test, function-aided sum test, and combined multivariate pooled test. To address multiple testing issues, we used Bonferroni correction to determine significance for the single SNP test because the huge computational load prevented us from using permutation. For all other tests, the experiment-wise LR threshold significance level was determined by computing 1000 permutations (Churchill and Doerge 1994). To compare the results of different tests at the same scale, we calculated the LR/LR99 values. With the a priori candidate genes (Table S12) as bait, we searched the gene network AraNet (Lee et al. 2010a) to find new genes with biological roles inferred by the annotations of the neighbors of these bait genes. AraNet is a probabilistic functional gene network that was constructed for Arabidopsis by a modified Bayesian integration of 24 types of \xe2\x80\x9comics\xe2\x80\x9d data from multiple organisms (Lee et al. 2010a). The connection between two genes has an associated log-likelihood score that measures the probability of a connection representing a true functional interaction. In Arabidopsis thaliana, flowering time is known to be regulated by a complex genetic network composed of four main converging pathways: the vernalization pathway, the photoperiod pathway, the autonomous pathway, and the gibberellin pathway. These pathways connect physiological and environmental factors, such as photoperiod variation, vernalization, ambient temperature, and plant growth, to promote or repress flowering at an appropriate time (Roux et al. 2006). It is known that several genes are involved in these biological networks. After obtaining the list of 293 a priori candidate genes, we first checked how many genes are connected by entering these candidate genes as query genes to find their relationships. Then we performed the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis for the connected genes to further verify their connections. Cross validation (i.e., omitting each seed gene in turn from the seed set) was used, where a higher retrieval rate is given to genes annotated to have the same function cluster in the network (positive) than to genes that are not annotated with that function (negative) in the ROC plot. The degree of the overall connection was summarized by the area under the ROC curve (AUC), ranging from 0.5 to 1 (i.e., genes with high values are deemed to be tightly clustered in a network). In each round, we removed the least-scored gene until the AUC value was greater than or equal to 0.95. If the statistically significant a priori candidate genes were in the connected network, they were regarded as the promising candidate genes. In addition, we used these connected a priori genes as bait to identify other flowering-time\xe2\x80\x93related genes in AraNet. Then we compared the top 30 significant tests that were not from the list of a priori candidate genes with the top 200 (this number was suggested by AraNet) network-connected genes that were retrieved by the bait genes to identify any potentially novel flowering-time\xe2\x80\x93related genes. To obtain an overall view of the potential function of polymorphisms within gene fragments, we analyzed the SNP frequency distribution and conducted function prediction with PolyPhen (Ramensky et al. 2002). First, the distribution of SNPs in different MAF categories showed that the proportion of SNPs with MAF less than 5% (0.5043 \xc2\xb1 0.0026) was significantly higher than the expected value (0.3632 \xc2\xb1 0.0024) under standard population genetics models (Nordborg et al. 2005) (Figure 2a). Second, nonsynonymous substitutions were more common than synonymous substitutions for rare SNPs with MAF less than 5% (Figure 2b). In addition, the distributions of SNPs with probably damaging or possibly damaging effects were skewed more to the left than the distributions of SNPs in other categories (Figure 2c, Table S5). The proportion of probably damaging SNPs was highest in the MAF 0\xe2\x80\x930.05 bin (0.74 \xc2\xb1 0.00045). These results suggest the action of weak purifying selection on amino acids in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome (Foxe et al. 2008; Nordborg et al. 2005). A) SNP frequency in different minor allele count categories; B) distribution of synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs across different minor allele frequencies; C) distribution of SNPs with different function prediction across different minor allele frequencies; D) PolyPhen-predicted functional SNP frequency across different minor allele frequencies; E) SIFT-predicted functional SNP frequency across different minor allele frequencies; and F) SIFT-predicted function class, deleterious or tolerant, and PolyPhen-predicted score value. SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism. MAF and the proportion of functional SNPs were inversely related in both PolyPhen and SIFT (Kumar et al. 2009) predictions (Figure 2d, e). The rapid decrease in the proportion of functional SNPs with increasing MAF was adequately modeled by a power regression function. The congruency (P-value = 1.8 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9234) between the two predictions was mainly driven by the large number of SNPs predicted to be benign by PolyPhen and tolerant by SIFT (Figure 2f). These results demonstrate that a high proportion of SNPs predicted to be functional have low to rare MAF and that analyzing these variants with appropriate statistics would facilitate establishing gene-trait association in GWAS. We used the mixed model to control for population structure by selecting the optimal model for different traits (Yu et al. 2006; Zhu and Yu 2009) (Table S2 and Table S3). Detailed inspection with quantile-quantile plots suggested the need for further adjustment with an inflation factor (Devlin et al. 2004). The combination of in- and post-testing adjustments was designed to achieve both accurate individual tests and overall control of false positives (Table S9, Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S3, Figure S4, Figure S5, Figure S6, Figure S7, Figure S8, Figure S9, Figure S10, Figure S11, Figure S12, Figure S13, Figure S14, Figure S15, and Figure S16). Single SNP tests were conducted for all 20,810 SNPs first. For gene fragments without any SNP with MAF less than 5%, the multiple common variant test was carried out. For gene fragments with SNP with MAF less than 5%, the sum test, weighted sum test, and function-aided sum test were carried out. For gene fragments with a combination of both common and rare variants, a final combined multivariate pooled test was carried out (Table S8). We examined the predicted function of the significant trait-associated SNPs (TAS). For common variants, 25.6% were nonsynonymous; 10.3%, synonymous; 41.0%, intronic; and 23.1%, intergenic (Table S10). These intronic and intergenic proportions were lower than those in human GWAS results (Hindorff et al. 2009b). When adjusted for the base number of each category, 0.042% of the tests for nonsynonymous was significant, which was higher than for synonymous (0.012%), intronic (0.020%), or intergenic (0.033%). Even with the in- and post-testing control, the slightly high number of TASs was not unexpected because that linkage disequilibrium was higher among SNPs with similar allele frequency than among SNPs with different allele frequency (Table S7) and there was a minor allele dependence issue (Table S11) (Brachi et al. 2010). In addition, because the LR test has been shown to be liberal (Atwell et al. 2010), we conducted additional permutation tests to determine the significance threshold. Under the assumption of CDCV, we inspected the significant results to identify specific sequence fragments corresponding to genes that were on the list of a priori candidate genes for flowering time and that had other biological function evidence. This resulted in four genes with robust associations (Table 1). First, the vernalization-response gene, FRIGIDA (FRI), has polymorphisms known to affect flowering time through their effect on FLC (FLOWERING LOCUS C) (Johanson et al. 2000; Shindo et al. 2005). The FRI gene was strongly associated with FRI expression levels and was also associated with FLC expression levels, consistent with other reports (Atwell et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2007). Second, the FCA gene, with a function in the posttranscriptional regulation of transcripts involved in the flowering process (Macknight et al. 1997), showed significant association with vernalization response to short days [\xc2\xb1V(SD)]. The association of FCA with flowering time was confirmed in previous analyses (Atwell et al. 2010; Brachi et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2007). Third, the FLC gene, encoding a MADS-domain protein acting as a repressor of flowering time (Ratcliffe et al. 2001), showed a significant association with day-length response with vernalization [SD/LD(V)] and short days with 5-week vernalization at University of Southern California (USC) (SDV). Fourth, the floral homeotic gene specifying floral meristem identity in Arabidopsis (Gustafson-Brown et al. 1994), APETALA1 (AP1), was associated with long days without vernalization at John Inns Centre (JIC) (JIC0W) and FLC expression levels, and it was also associated with long days with 4-week vernalization at John Inns Centre (JIC) (JIC4W) and response to length of vernalization (VERN) if rare variants were considered (Table 1). AP1 was detected among the 50 best associations in previous GWAS (Brachi et al. 2010). Furthermore, AP1 shares a biological process (GO: 0003700) with FLC, and its role in integrating signals from multiple pathways is well established (Mouradov et al. 2002). The associations of two additional genes, CR88 with JIC/USC and TIC with JIC4W, need further evidence, although both genes were a priori candidate genes involved in the light-dependent pathway (Cao et al. 2000) and the circadian clock (Ding et al. 2007). A third gene, DCL2, containing common variants, is discussed in the association and gene network section. If the statistically significant genes were not on the list of a priori candidate genes, we considered the top 30 significant tests out of 18,448 tests (16 traits \xc3\x97 1153 fragments) (Table S5, Table S8, and Table S13). Then we checked whether there was at least one significant functional SNP by functional prediction within each fragment. T23J18.17 (AT1G11510) and SMD1 (AT4G11130) met the requirements. Both genes were associated with SDV (Table S13). When rare variants were considered, all collapsed methods suggested an excess of significant genes associated with flowering-time\xe2\x80\x93related traits (Figure 4). Unlike the sum test, the weighted sum test and function-aided sum test assign different weights for different MAF. Accordingly, the results for these two methods were more consistent than those for the sum test. Consistence among three methods narrowed down the list of the significant candidate genes, which facilitated the follow-up validation studies (Figure 3). Considering the consistency across pooled rare association methods, 4 of the 35 a priori candidate genes showed a significant association with flowering-time\xe2\x80\x93related traits (Table 1, Figure 4, and Table S15). First, FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM), a MADS-domain gene that acts as an inhibitor of flowering in Arabidopsis (Scortecci et al. 2001), had significant association between pooled rare variants and long days without vernalization at USC (LD) across all methods. However, there was no significant association between common variants within the FLM gene and flowering-time\xe2\x80\x93related traits, and FLM was not detected in a GWAS with field experiments (Brachi et al. 2010). One explanation is that FLM contains accession-specific mutations (Werner et al. 2005) and is less likely to be detected by the regular methods. Under close examination, we found that rare mutations occur in diverse accessions; this suggests that multiple rare alleles in the FLM gene incrementally increase the proportion of genetic variation contributing to flowering time. Second, pooled rare variants in FY gene (Simpson et al. 2003) were significantly associated with long days with 2-week vernalization at JIC (JIC2W), 4-week vernalization (JIC4W), and 8-week vernalization (JIC8W) (Table 1), agreeing with a previous GWAS (Brachi et al. 2010). The difference is that common variants in the FY gene were significant in the previous GWAS, but pooled rare variants in the FY gene were significant in our study. We suggest that rare genetic variants generate synthetic associations that may have been credited to common variants (Dickson et al. 2010). Third, SPL5 showed significant association with chamber response with vernalization (JIC/USC). SPL5 and two closely related transcription factors (SPL3 and SPL4) have target sites for MicroRNA miR156, and these three genes have overlapping functions in regulating vegetative phase change and floral induction in Arabidopsis (Wu et al. 2009; Wu and Poethig 2006). Rare alleles were not addressed in the previous studies, so although SPL5 was not confirmed in two GWAS reports, it is still a good candidate. Finally, the pooled rare variant in BAS1 was associated with LD, JIC2W, and short days without vernalization at USC (SD), agreeing with its documented function in photomorphogenesis, hypocotyl elongation, and flowering time (Turk et al. 2005). However, caution is warranted because all three SNPs tested were intronic (Table S15). Venn diagram for the number of significant tests from different methods. The numbers in the joined areas indicate the overlap between two or among three methods. The number (18,843) outside of these circles represents tests that are not statistically significant. Candidate genes are overrepresented among statistically significant associations. A) LR/LR99 values from the weighted sum test vs. sum test; B) LR/LR99 values from the function-aided sum test vs. weighted sum test 14; and C) LR/LR99 values from the function-aided sum test vs. sum test. Four genes with rare variants (FLM, BAS1, SPL5, and FY) are highlighted. For gene fragments with rare variants, we identified those fragments that not only contained at least three significant functional SNPs from functional prediction but also were among the top 30 tests (out of 19,104 tests = 16 traits \xc3\x97 1194 fragments) (Table S5 and Table S14). This yielded 4 gene fragments: T9E8.100 (AT4G13360), MXF12.90 (AT5G39080), MWF20.13 (AT5G43420), and K24M7.26 (AT5G52500). All these genes were associated with either JIC/USC or JIC2W. Results from the function-aided sum tests of these genes were also significant. First, we entered 293 a priori candidate genes as query genes to find their relationships. The report showed that 161 genes are connected to each other (Table S16), 99 genes disconnected (Table S17), and 33 genes not found in AraNet (Table S18). Verification of these connections by ROC analysis suggested that 150 of these genes should be retained as query genes to identify other flowering-time\xe2\x80\x93related genes with",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

n AraNet (Figure 5) because the degree of the overall connection measured by the ROC AUC increased from 0.1013 (293) to 0.9505 (150). Comparing the statistically significant a priori genes with these 150 connected genes, we found that TIC and CR88 were not in the network. We then use the 150 connected genes as query genes to identify other flowering-time\xe2\x80\x93related genes. A total of 5501 associated genes, 18 times the original list, were identified and sorted by their log-likelihood scores. Predictive power of AraNet for flowering-time\xe2\x80\x93related pathways measured by cross-validated receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve analyses. A) All 293 a priori candidate genes and B) the 150 connected a priori candidate genes. This final list of genes provided additional biological filtering capacity to inspect the statistically significant tests (Table S13, Table S14, and Table S19). Eight of these genes (Table S20 and Table S22) were also among the top 30 statistically significant associations (Table S13 and Table S14). Notably, DCL2 (AT3G03300, ranked 148th within the 5501 gene list) was significantly associated with SDV (Table 1 and Figure 6). DCL2 is organized into a network by connecting to a priori flowering-time\xe2\x80\x93related genes, evidence for the connections coming from both plant- and animal-derived data sets. Only part of the network is shown. The background is the network constructed with the 150 connected a priori candidate genes. To determine how DCL2 is associated with flowering time, we examined its function connections with other a priori candidate genes (Figure 6, Table S21 and Table S22). In Figure 6, the left five genes formed a network belonging to the photoperiod/autonomous pathway, and the right three genes formed a flower development biological process (GO accession number: 0009908) (He et al. 2010). The two biological processes are linked by DCL1. Supporting evidence for the network prediction came primarily from AT-DC (co-occurrence of domains among Arabidopsis proteins) and AT-GN (gene neighborhoods of bacterial and archaeal orthologs of Arabidopsis) with supplementary evidence from HS-DC (co-occurrence of domains among human proteins). Indeed, recent research (not in TAIR7 on which AraNet was built) has shown that DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 redundantly function in RNA-directed DNA methylation and that triple mutants had delayed flowering (Henderson et al. 2006). In summary, 10 candidate genes out of a list of 35 a priori candidate genes were determined to have modest to robust associations. Among them, 8 were overlapped by AraNet either through common variant tests (AP1, FCA, FRI, and FLC) or through rare variant tests (FLM, FY, BAS1, and SPL5). Six other genes (two through common variant tests and 4 through rare variant tests) were determined to be interesting for follow-up studies because they all had top 30 significant tests and supporting evidence from function prediction. Finally, DCL2 and 7 additional genes had gene network support and statistical significance support. While some components of this CR-GWAS strategy have been proposed individually, our aim was to bridge advances in different areas. In GWAS, common variants are typically identified though individual testing, whereas rare variants, each with incommensurable effects on phenotypic traits, are difficult to identify using the traditional methods. For multiple rare mutations expected to affect phenotypic traits of interest, grouping variants from the same genes, pathways, and segmental conserved regions has provided promising results (Bodmer and Bonilla 2008; Cohen et al. 2004; Nejentsev et al. 2009). If various rare variants in a group influence phenotype of complex traits, focusing on the group rather than on an individual variant helps enrich the association signals, reduce the number of degrees of freedom in tests, and subsequently increase statistical power (Mccarthy et al. 2008). In the current study, we further factored function prediction and allele frequency distribution into a function-aided sum test of rare variants, establishing a bridge between two research areas: rare allele testing (Li and Leal 2008; Madsen and Browning 2009; Morris and Zeggini 2010) and function prediction (Kumar et al. 2009; Ramensky et al. 2002). Moreover, we addressed the connection of statistical significance of associate analysis and biological significance via a priori candidate genes and a gene network, the combination of which has not been widely explored. Similar gene networks have been constructed for C. elegans (WormNet), S. cerevisiae (YeastNet), M. musculus (MouseNet), and O. sativa (RiceNet). Individual components (i.e., function prediction, statistical testing for common and rare variants, functional annotation of genomes, and gene network construction) of the composite analysis demonstrated in this study should certainly improve over time, and the overall structure of CR-GWAS should also evolve to accommodate additional components. The ultimate goal is to maximize our capacity in complex trait dissection. Genetic architecture of flowering time has been extensively studied in the model species Arabidopsis and other plants. The complexity and redundancy involved in controlling the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase involves multiple pathways with many genes (Izawa et al. 2003; Komeda 2004). Recent association studies tested whether natural allelic variation of these known genes could account for the flowering-time differences within a diverse collection or derived populations (Atwell et al. 2010; Brachi et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2007). The allele frequency of genes in the association panel directly affects the signal strength and detection power of standard tests, but this has not been adequately addressed. Following the CR-GWAS strategy, we found that both common and rare variants in a series of genes (FRI, FLC, FCA, AP1, FLM, FY, SPL5, and DCL2) contribute to the flowering-time variation observed in a diverse collection of Arabidopsis ecotypes. Some additional genes identified through this composite analysis are likely to be further validated. Although the focus of the current study is on one specific experiment, the proposed approach can be applied quite generally. In the current study, we used resequenced candidate gene fragment data to showcase the CR-GWAS analysis. With the next-generation sequencing technology, we expect similar analysis strategies to be applied to exome sequencing and whole-genome resequencing studies. On the other hand, data generated through array-based genotyping approaches could also be analyzed in a similar framework if the ultrahigh-density genotyping chip containing rare SNPs provides adequate context sequence polymorphisms for function prediction. The capacity of genome databases and gene networks is expected to grow as similar bioinformatics frameworks spread to more species. In addition, incorporating various analytical methods developed for population stratification correction, testing of common variants and rare variants (with flexible weight assignment), threshold determination, and computational load reduction (Aulchenko et al. 2007; Devlin et al. 2004; Kang et al. 2010; Price et al. 2006; Pritchard et al. 2000; Yu et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2010) into a common platform would be challenging but highly desirable. We thank two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments to improve the manuscript. We thank Magnus Nordborg for making the resequencing data available for analysis and providing critical comments.

Sternberg', 'Phillip Hieter', 'Tim Schedl']","September 15, 2011.","G3, GENETICS, and the GSA: Two Journals, One Mission",,"b""With the June launch of its open-access journal G3: Genes | Genomes | Genetics, the Genetics Society of America (GSA) now offers two peer-edited journals. The missions of G3 and GENETICS are fundamentally the same: to provide a forum for timely communication of the latest findings in genetics, selected by editors who are the authors' peers. But the scopes of the two journals are different. Why offer two journals? Since 1916, GENETICS has sought to publish significant advances in the field. To be considered for publication in the journal, the Editors have stipulated that manuscripts must provide new insights into a biological process or demonstrate novel and creative approaches to an important biological problem or describe development of new resources, methods, technologies, or tools. And the study must be of interest to a wide range of genetics and genomics investigators. In short, the Editors of GENETICS seek to attract and publish articles that they believe will have a high impact on the field. However, the GSA recognizes that this leaves large gaps in its coverage of foundational genetics and genomic research. Impact is relative, and interest and significance are subjective terms; the potential significance of scientifically rigorous findings will never be realized if they remain hidden. New discoveries that advance a field, no matter its size, move science forward; emerging fields will be unable to develop if practitioners are unable to publish their findings. And genetic research increasingly relies on access to data sets; rapid publication of those data sets enables future insights. These are some of the reasons that led the GSA Board of Directors to launch G3 as GENETICS's sister journal. G3 seeks to publish articles that describe well-executed and lucidly-interpreted genetic studies of all kinds. G3 is not bound by the subjective editorial criteria of importance, novelty, or broad appeal. The only criteria for publication in G3 are that the results or resources described in the manuscript are scientifically sound and (actually or potentially) useful. And not being concerned for potential impact or broad appeal allows the Editors to streamline the review process, leading to quick decisions and publication. G3's mandate includes publishing foundational research\xe2\x80\x93the cornerstones of future insights and the building blocks of our discipline. Genome maps (genetic, physical, and sequence) may not provide immediate biological insights, but they pave the way for future discoveries. If those discoveries are to be realized, such data must be made freely accessible to geneticists. Genome-wide association (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies may not always illuminate the trait under study, but the data are likely to be useful; instead of important genetic data remaining unseen in a notebook, publication offers the potential for discovery, usefulness, and synergy. In short, G3 emphasizes experimental design and potential usefulness rather than immediate or subjective impact. G3 offers the opportunity to publish the puzzling finding or to present unpublished results that may not have been submitted for review and publication due to a perceived lack of a potential high-impact finding. Examples of studies valuable to our scientific community and therefore worthy of consideration for publication in G3 are (1) genetic and genomic studies with organisms or aspects of biology where the audience/field is small or emerging; (2) QTL studies limited to a single population; (3) mutant or RNAi screens without extensive further mutant characterization; (4) reports of genetic and physical genome maps or collections of characterized genetic markers; (5) personal exome and genome sequencing case, disease, and population reports; and (6) genome-wide association studies and analysis, including gene expression, SNP, and CNV studies in disease and control cohorts. G3 also provides a unified home for reporting genome sequence and genetic/physical maps of any organism or cell of interest. How is G3 different from GENETICS? Its criteria for publication are simpler: the study need only be judged scientifically sound and actually or potentially useful. Why is G3 different from GENETICS? Because these findings need to be made available in the age of genomics, regardless of predicted or perceived significance or interest. Why have we created yet another new journal? Because the Genetics Society of America and the Editors of GENETICS and G3 recognized the need to provide forums for observations of importance as well as for studies of obvious significance. We are fulfilling our responsibility to satisfy that need. Join us in advancing our field: submit your best work for publication in the peer-edited journals of the Genetics Society of America.

Martin', 'Radhakrishnan Mahadevan', 'Kristin Baetz']","September 15, 2011.",Chemical and Synthetic Genetic Array Analysis Identifies Genes that Suppress Xylose Utilization and Fermentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"b'Though highly efficient at fermenting hexose sugars, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has limited ability to ferment five-carbon sugars. As a significant portion of sugars found in cellulosic biomass is the five-carbon sugar xylose, S. cerevisiae must be engineered to metabolize pentose sugars, commonly by the addition of exogenous genes from xylose fermenting fungi. However, these recombinant strains grow poorly on xylose and require further improvement through rational engineering or evolutionary adaptation. To identify unknown genes that contribute to improved xylose fermentation in these recombinant S. cerevisiae, we performed genome-wide synthetic interaction screens to identify deletion mutants that impact xylose utilization of strains expressing the xylose isomerase gene XYLA from Piromyces sp. E2 alone or with an additional copy of the endogenous xylulokinase gene XKS1. We also screened the deletion mutant array to identify mutants whose growth is affected by xylose. Our genetic network reveals that more than 80 nonessential genes from a diverse range of cellular processes impact xylose utilization. Surprisingly, we identified four genes, ALP1, ISC1, RPL20B, and BUD21, that when individually deleted improved xylose utilization of both S. cerevisiae S288C and CEN.PK strains. We further characterized BUD21 deletion mutant cells in batch fermentations and found that they produce ethanol even the absence of exogenous XYLA. We have demonstrated that the ability of laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae to utilize xylose as a sole carbon source is suppressed, which implies that S. cerevisiae may not require the addition of exogenous genes for efficient xylose fermentation.Cellulosic fermentation for the production of fuels and chemicals has many advantages as cellulose, the main component of plant cell walls, is very abundant in agricultural and forestry waste and this feedstock does not compete with valuable food source (reviewed in Lynd et al. 2008; Rubin 2008). Though cellulose is abundant and renewable, numerous hurdles remain in making cellulosic ethanol production an economically viable industry. In contrast to cane sugar or starch fermentation, due to the complex nature of the carbohydrate present in cellulosic biomass, a significant amount of xylose and arabinose (5-carbon sugars derived from the hemicellulose portion of the lignocellulose) is present in the biomass hydrolysates (Saha 2003). Indeed, after glucose, D-xylose is the second most abundant sugar in hemicelluloses. Therefore, in order to maximize the potential for ethanol production, ethanologenic fermentation strains must be capable of utilizing both pentose and hexose sugars present in the lignocellulose. Though Saccharomyces cerevisiae has an exceptional ability for rapid anaerobic growth and fermentation of hexose sugars, it has been generally reported that laboratory strains exhibit only a negligible metabolism of xylose (Chiang et al. 1981; Gong et al. 1983; Wang et al. 1980). This phenotype is in spite of the fact that S288C laboratory yeast has endogenous genes that appear to encode a putative xylose utilization pathway (Figure 1). The present strategy to improve the ability of S. cerevisiae to ferment xylose has been the introduction of exogenous genes from xylose-fermenting fungi (reviewed in Hahn-Hagerdal et al. 2007; Matsushika et al. 2009; Van Vleet and Jeffries 2009). The most common strategy involves the introduction of xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) genes and the overexpression of the endogenous xylulokinase gene (XKS1) (Hallborn et al. 1991; Ho et al. 1998; Jin et al. 2002; Kotter et al. 1990). As the XR/XDH pathway can result in a cofactor imbalance that has been shown to negatively impact metabolic flux (reviewed in Hahn-Hagerdal et al. 2007; Matsushika et al. 2009; Van Vleet and Jeffries 2009), a second strategy has emerged that introduces a bacterial xylose isomerase (XI) gene into yeast, which allows for the slow metabolism of xylose via the endogenousXks1 (Karhumaa et al. 2005; Kuyper et al. 2003; Madhavan et al. 2009; Walfridsson et al. 1996). Considerable effort has been made to improve pentose fermentation, including engineering or optimizing xylose enzyme activity (XR, XK, XDH, and XI), xylose transport, and the pentose phosphate pathway; reducing redox imbalances; and other strategies (reviewed in Hahn-Hagerdal et al. 2007; Matsushika et al. 2009). Despite significant directed efforts focusing on known proteins or pathways impacting xylose utilization and fermentation, ethanol production from xylose remains inefficient in recombinant S. cerevisiae strains and suggests that novel strategies should be considered. It is clear that despite the common belief that S. cerevisiae cannot use xylose as a carbon source, many wild and industrial wine yeast strains are in fact capable of xylose utilization (Attfield and Bell 2006; Wenger et al. 2010). The ability of some industrial yeast to utilize xylose was recently mapped to a putative xylitol dehydrogenase gene, XDH1 that is not present in the laboratory S288C strain (Wenger et al. 2010). Importantly, Wenger et al. (2010) determined that XDH1 requires the endogenous XR genes GRE3 and YPR1 and the endogenous XK gene XKS1 to allow for xylose utilization. In contrast, they also found that three putative XDH genes, SOR1, SOR2, and XYL2, suppressed the ability of XDH1 expressing strains to utilize xylose (Wenger et al. 2010). This work not only illustrated that S. cerevisiae is genetically \xe2\x80\x9cprimed\xe2\x80\x9d to ferment xylose but also suggested that additional endogenous proteins may either positively or negatively impact the ability of S. cerevisiae to utilize xylose. In an attempt to isolate such proteins, we performed genome-wide synthetic genetic array (SGA) screens (Tong et al. 2001) to identify deletion mutants that impact the xylose utilization of strains expressing the XI gene XYLA from Piromyces sp. E2 (herein referred to as pXYLA) and strains expressing both XYLA and an additional copy of the endogenous XK gene XKS1 (herein referred to as pXYLA,XKS1). To compliment this effort, we screened the deletion mutant array to identify mutants whose growth is either negatively or positively impacted by xylose. Our genetic network reveals that more than 80 nonessential genes from a diverse range of cellular processes impact xylose utilization. Surprisingly, we identified four deletion mutants that improved xylose consumption of laboratory S288C, even in the absence of exogenous XYLA. Next, we deleted these genes in an ethanol-tolerant CEN.PK strain and confirmed that all four mutants improved xylose utilization and that the deletion of BUD21 improves xylose fermentation. These data suggest that the natural ability of S. cerevisiae to recognize and utilize xylose was suppressed, and they validate the use of systems biology approaches using S288C as a means to identify novel pathways contributing to xylose fermentation.'","b'Though highly efficient at fermenting hexose sugars, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has limited ability to ferment five-carbon sugars.

The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The MATa deletion mutant array (DMA) was purchased from OpenBiosystems (Catalog no. YSC1053). The deletion strains generated for this study were designed using a standard PCR-mediated gene insertion technique (Longtine et al. 1998) and confirmed by PCR analysis using two sets of primer pairs (sequences available upon request). Plasmids were transformed into wild-type cells using a standard LiAc protocol (Gietz and Schiestl 2007). The XYLA and XKS1 genes were cloned into the pYES2 shuttle vector (Invitrogen), each preceded by the Kozak sequence (GCCACC) and flanked by the triosephosphate isomerase constitutive promoter (TPIp) and thecytochrome C1 transcription terminator (CYC1tt). First, the GAL1 promoter sequence was removed from pYES2, and then TPIp and XYLA were amplified by PCR with genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae and Piromyces sp. E2 genomic DNA, respectively, and inserted upstream of CYC1tt, as described previously (Kuyper et al. 2003), resulting in pYES2-XYLA-CYC1tt [herein called pXYLA (pKB60)]. TPIp was obtained using the primer combination of TPI-NheI-Fwd 5\xe2\x80\xb2-GATCGCTAGCTGTTsTAAAGATTACGGATAT-3\xe2\x80\xb2 and TPI-EcoRI-Rev 5\xe2\x80\xb2-GATCGAATTCTTTTAGTTTATGTATGTGTTTTTTGTAG-3\xe2\x80\xb2. Primers for PCR amplification from S. cerevisiae were based on genomic sequence data for strain S288C, although the strain used as DNA template was CEN.PK113-13D. Phusion HF DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) was used for all PCR reactions. Next, a XKS1-CYC1tt-TPIp cassette was assembled. A second TPIp was amplified by PCR using primer pair TPI-HindIII-Fwd 5\xe2\x80\xb2-GATCAAGCTTTGTTTAAAGATTACGGATAT-3\xe2\x80\xb2 and TPI-EcoRI-Rev. CYC1tt could not be successfully PCR-amplified from the pYES2 vector, so the following strategy was taken to excise it for cloning: pYES2 was digested with NsiI and religated upon itself, reducing it to a 2.2-kbp mini-pYES2 version of itself, still containing the bla resistance gene CYC1tt with a single NsiI site just upstream of it and the pUC origin. A HindIII site was introduced 100 bp downstream of CYC1tt by PCR-amplifying mini-pYES2 with the primer combination of pYES-CYC-AvrII-Fwd 5\xe2\x80\xb2-GATCCCTAGGTTCGGCTGCGGCGAGCGGTA-3\xe2\x80\xb2 and pYES-CYC-HindIII-AvrII-Rev 5\xe2\x80\xb2-GATCCCTAGGAAGCTTCGACCGAGCGCAGCGAGTCA-3\xe2\x80\xb2. The resulting PCR product was digested with AvrII, ligated upon itself, and then transformed into Escherichia coli DH5\xce\xb1. The vector was reisolated and digested with NsiI and HindIII to release the CYC1tt fragment. XKS1 was amplified by PCR from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA with primer pairXKS1-EcoRI-Fwd 5\xe2\x80\xb2-GATCGAATTCGCCACCATGAGAGTCTTTTCCAGTTCGCTTAA-3\xe2\x80\xb2 andXKS1-NsiI-Rev 5\xe2\x80\xb2-GATCATGCATATGTTGTGTTCAGTAATTCAGAGACAG-3\xe2\x80\xb2. The XKS1 and new TPIp PCR products were digested with NsiI and HindIII, respectively, and in a single reaction ligated together with the CYC1tt fragment. The resulting cassette was reamplified by PCR using primersXKS1-EcoRI-Fwd and TPI-EcoRI-Rev, digested with EcoRI, and inserted at the EcoRI site between the first TPIp and XYLA in pYES2-TPIp-xylA-CYC1tt, resulting in the final pYES2-TPIp-XKS1-CYCtt-TPIp-XYLA-CYC1tt vector [herein called pXYLA,XKS1 (pKB61)]. Cells were grown in standard YEP or synthetic complete (SC) media supplemented with glucose or xylose to a final concentration of 2%, unless otherwise described. To assess growth under xylose and glucose conditions, wild-type cells were grown in YEP media supplemented with either 2% glucose or xylose, and transformed cells were grown in SC-uracil (to maintain the plasmid) supplemented with either 2% xylose or glucose. Cells were grown to midlog phase in the carbon source of interest, and then either growth curve or dot assays were performed. Semi-aerobic growth curve analysis was performed in triplicate on Multiskan Ascent plate reader (Thermo Electron Corporation) in sealed plates, at 30\xc2\xb0 with shaking at 480 rpm prior to the OD600 measurements that were taken every 30 min over a 20-hr period. Dot assays were performed by spotting 5 \xc2\xb5l of 10-fold serial dilutions (OD600 = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001) onto specified media, and sealed plates were incubated at 30\xc2\xb0. All growth curve and dot assay experiments were repeated using three different isolates of each strain. Independent yeast colonies were cultured in 2 ml of selective media supplemented with either 2% glucose or xylose and incubated at 30\xc2\xb0 overnight with shaking. Following overnight culturing, 500 \xc2\xb5l of the culture was transferred into 10 ml of fresh media supplemented with 2% xylose or glucose and incubated for 24 hr at 30\xc2\xb0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with sterile YEP media, and pitched at 1.5 \xc3\x97 107 cells/ml into shaker flasks containing either 100 ml of glucose- or xylose-containing media at 13 g/l. Flasks were shaken at 250 rpm at 30\xc2\xb0. Consumption assays were performed in triplicate, and samples were taken at 24-hr intervals to check for sugar utilization. The glucose concentration was determined using the Glucose (GO) Assay Kit (Sigma GAGO-20) per the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s guidelines. Xylose concentration was determined using the phloroglucinol assay (Eberts et al. 1979). Briefly, the color reagent of 0.5 g of phloroglucinol (Sigma), 100 ml of glacial acetic acid, and 10 ml of concentrated HCl was freshly prepared and kept in the dark. Stock standard xylose (10 g/l) was prepared by dissolving D-xylose powder in saturated benzoic acid (Sigma) and used for preparation of the calibration curve. Samples (200 \xc2\xb5l) were mixed with 5 ml color reagent and subsequently heated at 100\xc2\xb0 for 4 min. The reaction was rapidly cooled to room temperature in iced water, and the absorbance at 540 nm was recorded. Robotic manipulation of the deletion mutant array was conducted using a Singer RoToR HDA (Singer Instruments). For the genome-wide XYLA and XYLA,XKS1 SGA screens, the MATa query strain Y7092 (Tong and Boone 2006) was transformed with either pXYLA (YKB2179) or pXYLA,XKS1 (YKB2178). The resulting query strains were mated to the MATa deletion mutant array, and SGA methodology (Tong et al. 2001; Tong et al. 2004) was used with the modifications previously described to maintain selection of the plasmid (Measday et al. 2005). After the final round of pinning on SD-uracil (2% glucose), the DMA containing the plasmids were subsequently pinned onto plates containing 2% xylose (SX-uracil). To identify deletion mutants that displayed growth defects or advantages on xylose, the deletion mutant array was also screened directly on 2% xylose plates. All three genome-wide screens were performed in triplicate at 30\xc2\xb0, and growth was visually scored for slow growth, lethality, or suppression after one day on glucose and two days on xylose. Putative genetic interactions identified in a minimum of two out of three replicates in any of the five screens (DMA on xylose, pXYLA on glucose, pXYLA,XKS1 on glucose, pXYLA on xylose, and pXYLA,XKS1 on xylose) were confirmed in all five conditions. In brief, the deletion mutant was transformed using traditional methods (Gietz and Schiestl 2007) with the vector control pRS415 (Sikorski and Hieter 1989), pXYLA, or pXYLA,XKS1, and a series of dot assays were performed on SC-uracil media with either 2% glucose or 2% xylose as the sole carbon source at 30\xc2\xb0. Confirmed genetic interactions and xylose sensitivity are listed insupporting information,Table S1. Independent yeast colonies, isolated from YPD-agar plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 2% agar), were first cultivated in 50 ml conical tubes containing 15 ml YEP (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) medium supplemented with 2% (20 g/l) glucose at 30\xc2\xb0, 200 rpm. Inoculum cultures were started by transferring 500 \xc2\xb5l of the tube-grown cultures into 250 ml flasks containing 25 ml YEP medium supplemented with 2% (20 g/l) xylose or 2% (20 g/l) glucose (depending on the sugar to be used in the batch fermentations) and incubated for 24 hr at 30\xc2\xb0 and 200 rpm. The cells from these precultures were harvested by centrifugation at 18,000 g for 5 min at 4\xc2\xb0, washed twice with sterile YEP media, and then used to inoculate final batch fermentations at an initial OD620nm = 0.1. Batch fermentations were performed using 250 ml flasks containing 50 ml of YEP medium supplemented with 2% (20 g/l) of the desired carbon source (xylose or glucose) as indicated and incubated in a rotary shaker at 30\xc2\xb0 and 200 rpm. Samples for determination of biomass and metabolite concentration were periodically withdrawn under sterile conditions. The batches were terminated when no further changes in OD were observed, as after the sugar has been depleted the cells can begin to consume the ethanol. The data plotted were observed by reading until the maximum concentration of ethanol was observed. For the characterization of the strains used in this work, specific rates of growth (\xc2\xb5), glucose consumption (qGlc), xylose consumption (qXyl), ethanol production (qEtOH), yield of ethanol on glucose (YEtOH/Glc), and yield of ethanol on xylose (YEtOH/Xyl) were determined. The \xc2\xb5, qGlc, and qXyl values were calculated during exponential growth phase. Because growth rates and ethanol production kinetics differed among studied strains, qEtOH, YEtOH/Glc, and YEtOH/Xyl were calculated considering only the ethanol production phase, defined as the period from starting one sample before ethanol was detected up to the point when a sharp decrease in ethanol accumulation was observed. Following the same criteria, plots were constructed using only the data corresponding to the ethanol production phase. Flask cultures were performed at least in duplicate. The values reported represent the means of the experiments performed. Cell growth was followed as optical density at 620 nm (spectrophotometer GENESYS20, ThermoFisher Scientific). Biomass was determined as dry-cell weight as described previously (Parachin et al. 2010). Glucose, xylose, ethanol, xylitol, acetate, and glycerol were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (UltiMate 3000, Dionex) with refractive index detector (Shodex). Samples were loaded onto an Aminex HPX-87H ion exchange column (BioRad) operated at 42\xc2\xb0 and eluted with 5 mm H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Our goal was to use SGA methodology to systematically screen the laboratory S288C yeast deletion mutant array to identify genetic determinants of xylose fermentation. As S288C has limited ability to utilize xylose (Chiang et al. 1981; Gong et al. 1983; Wang et al. 1980), our first goal was to construct a SGA query strain (Tong et al. 2001) with improved growth on xylose. Two plasmids, one expressing the Piromyces sp. E2 XI gene XYLA and the other expressing the combination of XYLA and the endogenous XK gene XKS1, were introduced into the wild-type laboratory strain (A, B inFigure S1). A series of growth curve analyses determined that, although the addition of pXYLA endowed growth on xylose, those cells expressing both XYLA and additional XKS1 (pXYLA,XKS1) displayed a further improvement in growth on xylose (Figure S2). Similarly, in aerobic batch fermentations, strains containing pXYLA or pXYLA,XKS1 displayed 14-fold and 15-fold improvement in xylose consumption, respectively, compared to the wild-type strains (C inFigure S2). These results demonstrate that the introduction of XYLA and additional XKS1 improves the ability of the SGA query strain to utilize xylose as a carbon source, and they replicate previous studies using exogenous XI genes (reviewed in Van Maris et al. 2007). We performed genome-wide SL-SGA screens with both pXYLA- and pXYLA,XKS1-containing query strains. In brief, query strains containing pXYLA or pXYLA,XKS1 were mated to the yeast deletion mutant array, and the SGA methodology was used to incorporate the plasmids into the deletion mutants (Tong et al. 2001). The growth of the deletion mutants containing the plasmids was tested on both glucose (Figure 2) and xylose (Figure 3) media. As a control, the deletion mutant array (without pXYLA or pXYLA,XKS1) was also screened for growth on xylose. Deletion mutants or deletion mutant\xe2\x80\x93plasmid combinations that resulted in synthetic lethality (SL), slow growth (SG), or improved growth (suppressor) were identified (see Materials and Methods). To confirm the chemical and genetic interactions, regardless of which screen the mutant was identified in, each mutant was independently transformed with three different plasmids (vector control, pXYLA, and pXYLA,XKS1), dot assays were performed on plates containing either 2% glucose or 2% xylose as the carbon source, and growth was scored (seeTable S1 for a full list of interactions).

(A) Genome-wide synthetic interaction SGA screens were performed using query strains that were transformed with pXYLA (YKB2179) and pXYLA,XKS1 (YKB2178) and screened xylose plates.

Deletion mutants that display synthetic lethal interactions are indicated by *. (B) Venn diagrams showing the number of overlapping genes in each of the screens performed: pXYLA on xylose and glucose and pXYLA,XKS1 on xylose and glucose. The addition of pXYLA or pXYLA,XKS1 negatively affected the growth of 23 deletion mutants on glucose, and each plasmid had largely distinct genetic interactions (Figure 2). The addition of pXYLA resulted in slow growth in 13 deletion mutants and was lethal to deletion mutants of the vacuole zinc transporter ZRC1 (MacDiarmid et al. 2000) and the uncharacterized genes ERV15 and YDR114c. While additional XKS1 relieved the lethality in these three strains, it caused lethality in deletion mutants of the large 60S ribosomal subunit RPL35A (Venema and Tollervey 1999) and slow growth in 8 additional deletion mutants. Only deletion mutants of the ESCRT-I component VPS28 and the uncharacterized gene FYV4 were sensitive to both plasmids. This result suggests that, although the addition of the exogenous gene XYLA and increased XKS1 expression did not detectably impact the growth rate or consumption of glucose in a S288C wild-type background (Figure S2), their addition is not neutral and has cellular consequences in certain deletion mutant backgrounds. Although there have been contradictory reports regarding the impact of XKS1 overexpression on growth rate and xylose consumption (Ho et al. 1998; Johansson et al. 2001; Matsushika and Sawayama 2008; Richard et al. 2000; Rodriguez-Pena et al. 1998; Toivari et al. 2001), it is clear that XKS1 driven by the TPI1 promoter not only increases xylose consumption (C inFigure S2) but also results in a synthetic dosage effect in many mutant backgrounds. The majority of strains in the deletion mutant array could grow, albeit slowly, on media where the sole carbon was 2% xylose. We found that 4 deletion mutants were not viable (ATP10, PEX13, PHO84, and XKS1) on xylose and 26 deletion mutants displayed slow growth on xylose (Figure 3,Table S1). Remarkably, the vast majority of xylose-sensitive mutants could be rescued by the addition of pXYLA or pXYLA,XKS1 plasmid. The exception to this was XKS1. As expected, xks1\xce\x94 cells could not grow on 2% xylose, but they could be partially rescued by pXYLA or pXYLA,XKS1. As pXYLA,XKS1 could only partially rescue xks1\xce\x94 on xylose, it suggests that both copies of XKS1, the endogenous genomic copy and the plasmid-borne copy, are necessary to promote maximum xylose utilization S288C. Similar to the results on glucose, pXYLA and pXYLA,XKS1 displayed largely distinct genetic interactions on xylose (Figure 3A). While pXYLA negatively affected the growth of 16 deletion mutants on xylose (3 SL and 13 SG), pXYLA,XKS1 negatively affected the growth of 37 deletion mutants on xylose (8 SL and 29 SG). For both plasmids, the genetic interactions they displayed on glucose were not all replicated on xylose media (Figure 3B). This result indicates that the detrimental effects of XYLA or XKS1 expression on glucose in certain deletion mutant backgrounds can be alleviated by growth on xylose. The pXYLA and pXYLA,XKS1 xylose interaction network is not limited to known players in carbohydrate metabolism; rather, the network implies that genes associated with diverse cellular pathways are required for XI-mediated xylose metabolism, including translation, DNA repair, and protein transport. For example, of the 53 genes identified between the two plasmids, FUNSPEC analysis (Robinson et al. 2002) indicates that a significant number encode components of the cytoplasmic ribosomal large subunit (P = 4.1e\xe2\x88\x925) or are implicated in the GO biological process of translation elongation (P = 0.003805). This chemical and functional genomics study dramatically expands our knowledge of proteins and pathways that are required for xylose utilization and optimal function of the XI/XK pathway. The genome-wide chemical and genetic screens identified four deletion mutants that improved growth on xylose: RPL20B, ALP1, ISC1, and BUD21. All four putative suppressors, which to date have not been linked to pentose metabolism, are implicated in three diverse biological processes.Alp1 is an arginine transporter (Regenberg et al. 1999),Isc1 is a mitochondrial membrane\xe2\x80\x93localized inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase C (Betz et al. 2002),Rpl20B is a component of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit (Lecompte et al. 2002; Planta and Mager 1998; Venema and Tollervey 1999), andBud21 is a component of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) processosome (Dragon et al. 2002). To confirm that the null mutants of these genes confer advantageous growth on xylose, the genes were directly knocked out of a S288C laboratory strain, and a series of growth analyses and sugar consumption assays were performed (Figure 4). Deletion of these genes did not detectably impact growth on glucose (Figure 4A), and only deletion of ISC1 and BUD21 resulted in minor decreases in glucose consumption (Figure 4C). However, when the suppressor strains were grown on xylose media, they grew better than the wild-type strain (Figure 4A) and had dramatic improvements in xylose consumption (Figure 4C). We next asked if these suppressors could improve the consumption of xylose over and above that conferred by pXYLA,XKS1. Though the suppressors in combination with pXYLA,XKS1 did not dramatically improve growth on xylose, the deletion of BUD21 and RPL20B displayed reproducibly minor improvements of growth on xylose (Figure 4B). The suppressors of all these genes improved the consumption of xylose of strains transformed with pXYLA,XKS1 from a modest 12% for RPL20B to 27.5% for BUD21. We next asked if a combination of the suppressors might result in a further improvement of xylose utilization. Though no double mutant was deleterious to growth on glucose or xylose media (data not shown), improvements in xylose consumption were either negligible or modest at best (Table S2). This finding suggests that the proteins encoded by these genes, although not presently linked, may be working through the same pathway or mechanisms to inhibit xylose consumption in S288C S. cerevisiae. Deletion of ALP1, BUD21, ISC1, or RPL20B improve the xylose utilization of S288C yeast even in the absence of exogenous XI. Wild-type (WT, Y7092), alp1\xce\x94 (YKB2069), isc1\xce\x94 (YKB2530), rpl20b\xce\x94 (YKB 2531), and bud21\xce\x94 (YKB2532) cells without (A) or with pXYLA,XKS1 (B) were plated in 10-fold serial dilutions onto YEP plates containing glucose or xylose. Plates were incubated at 30\xc2\xb0 for 1 day on glucose and 2 days on xylose. (C) Analysis of the consumption of glucose and xylose of the four suppressor mutants, alp1\xce\x94 (YKB2069), isc1\xce\x94 (YKB2530), rpl20b\xce\x94 (YKB 2531), and bud21\xce\x94 (YKB2532), compared to wild-type (WT, Y7092), either alone or transformed with pXYLA,XKS1. Growth cultures were started in either 13% glucose or xylose media, pitched with 1.5 \xc3\x97 107 cells/ml and carried out at 30\xc2\xb0 with for 168 hr. The calculation for g/l of sugars consumed corresponds to the concentrations of sugars observed at the end of the batches compared to the starting amount. We next wanted to determine whether the suppressors identified in S288C also functioned as suppressors of xylose utilization in other yeast strains. For this purpose, we utilized the ethanol-tolerant MATa CEN.PK 113-3D strain (Van Dijken et al. 2000) that has previously been used in numerous xylose fermentation studies (Eliasson et al. 2000; Johansson et al. 2001; Van Vleet et al. 2008). Deletion mutants in CEN.PK 133-3D (hereafter called CEN.PK) were generated for BUD21, ISC1, ALP1, and RPL20b and subsequently transformed with pXYLA,XKS1. As seen for S288C, deletion of the suppressors resulted in the dramatic improvement of the ability of CEN.PK to grow on xylose plates, even in the absence of pXYLA,XKS1 (Figure 5). Deletion of ALP1, BUD21, ISC1, or RPL20B improve the xylose utilization of CEN.PK yeast. CEN.PK 133-13D wild-type (WT, YKB2684), alp1\xce\x94 (YKB2668), isc1\xce\x94 (YKB2670), rpl20b\xce\x94 (YKB2665), and bud21\xce\x94 (YKB2666) cells, alone or transformed with pXYLA,XKS1, were plated in 10-fold serial dilutions onto YEP plates containing glucose or xylose. Plates were incubated at 30\xc2\xb0 for 1 day on glucose and 2 days on xylose. We next performed a series of controlled aerobic batch fermentation studies to assess whether one of the suppressors could improve xylose fermentation. BUD21 was selected as its deletion resulted in the greatest improvement in xylose consumption in the S288C background with and without the addition pXYLA,XKS1 (Figure 4). The fermentations were performed using CEN.PK and CEN.PK bud21\xce\x94 with and without pXYLA,XKS1 in both glucose (Table 2,Figure S3) and xylose (Table 3, Figure 6). For xylose and glucose fermentation, the concentrations of xylose or glucose, ethanol, acetate, and glycerol were measured, along with the cell biomass. In addition, xylitol levels were measured in the xylose fermentation. During glucose fermentation, the addition of pXYLA,XKS1 or deletion of BUD21 resulted in an increment in the specific growth rate and final biomass levels compared with the control strain; however, this rise in biomass production resulted in nearly identical decreases in both ethanol and glycerol production (Table 2,Figure S3). Surprisingly, the CEN.PK strain containing both the bud21\xce\x94 and pXYLA,XKS1 not only caused a further reduction in ethanol and glycerol production but also a dramatic increase in acetate production. This increase may reflect the increase in growth rate of this strain and the associated energetic demand. Deletion of BUD21 improves the xylose fermentation of CEN.PK yeast. Fermentation profile of the S. cerevisiae CEN.PK 113-13D derivative strains during aerobic batch cultivation in xylose (20 g/l). (A) CEN.PK 113-13D wild-type (WT, YKB2684), (B) WT transformed with pXYLA,XKS1 (YKB2680), (C) bud21\xce\x94 (YKB2666), and (D) bud21\xce\x94 transformed with pXYLA,XKS1 (YKB2667). Biomass (\xe2\x97\x8f), xylose (\xe2\x96\xaa), ethanol (\xe2\x97\x8b), glycerol (\xe2\x96\xb3), acetate (\xe2\x96\xb4), and xylitol (\xe2\x8b\x84). The batches were terminated when no further changes in OD were observed. Each data point represents the mean \xc2\xb1 SD from triplicate experiments. As expected, the control CEN.PK strain showed no increase in biomass or ethanol production in xylose (Figure 6, Table 3). In case of the CEN.PK strain containing pXYLA,XKS1, there was a significant increase in biomass and ethanol production (5.295 g/l), and a low level of xylitol was detected in the cells at the end of the fermentation (Figure 6, Table 3). The greatest biomass increase was observed for the suppressor-deficient strain bud21\xce\x94, once again con",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

irming that the strain is capable of sustained growth in xylose media. Although the bud21\xce\x94 strain was also able to produce ethanol (3 g/l), its ethanol production may be hindered due to a buildup of xylitol in the cells (Table 3), which may in turn be the result of a redox imbalance in the cells. Unfortunately, the combination of bud21\xce\x94 and pXYLA,XKS1 did not result in an improvement in fermentative capacity in xylose (Figure 6D). Despite the fast initial burst in growth (increased \xce\xbc), biomass did not increase over the course of the experiment and ethanol production was low (1 g/l), although its overall ethanol yield (YEtOH/Xyl) was nearly equivalent to the CEN.PK pXYLA,XKS1 strain (Table 3). Although combining the XI with the deletion of the suppressor BUD21 did not lead to additive ethanol production, the SGA screen identified a deletion mutant that can consume xylose and produce ethanol at production levels and kinetics similar to strains containing exogenous xylose pathway genes (Matsushika et al. 2009). Not only does this result justify the continued use of functional genomics as a tool for identifying novel genetic strategies to improve industrial yeast strains but it also implies that S. cerevisiae may not require the addition of exogenous genes for efficient xylose fermentation. The majority of studies to date on improving xylose utilization in S. cerevisiae have taken a candidate gene or directed approach (reviewed in Van Vleet and Jeffries 2009). Unfortunately, these approaches are limited by our knowledge of the pathways/proteins regulating xylose utilization. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply genome-wide chemical and synthetic genetic interaction screens to systematically assess the contribution of nonessential genes to xylose utilization via both endogenous and exogenous XI pathways. Indeed, despite the wealth of genetic interactions generated by large-scale SGA screening (Costanzo et al. 2010; Tong et al. 2001; Tong et al. 2004), only four genetic interactions have been identified for XKS1 (Costanzo et al. 2010; Fiedler et al. 2009), which may reflect the fact that most SGA screens have been conducted on standard glucose media. We found that, in spite of the numerous reports indicating that laboratory S. cerevisiae strains cannot utilize xylose (Batt et al. 1986; Chiang et al. 1981; Gong et al. 1983; Wang et al. 1980), the vast majority of deletion mutant strains could survive when xylose was the sole carbon source (Figure 3A). This is not unexpected as the S. cerevisiae genome encodes a putative xylose utilization pathway (Figure 1) and many members of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group have the ability to utilize xylose as a carbon source (Attfield and Bell 2006; Wenger et al. 2010). While XKS1 was identified as being essential for growth on xylose, no other genes encoding components of endogenous xylose pathway (Figure 1) were identified in any of the screens. This is likely because there are multiple putative redundant genes that encode for xylose reductase and D-xylitol dehydrogenase, whereasXks1 may be the sole xylulokinase. That said, pXYLA alone could rescue xks1\xce\x94 growth on xylose, which suggests that there may be alternative proteins/pathways in yeast that can convert D-xylulose and that there may be alternative noncanonical XR and XDH genes, too. Many of the xylose-sensitive deletion mutants are, as expected, implicated in mitochondrial functions because, during growth on xylose, the redox cofactors NADH and NADPH are involved in catabolism and biosynthesis (Mo et al. 2009; Salusjarvi et al. 2003; Shi et al. 2002). Remarkably, the vast majority of xylose-sensitive mutants could be rescued by the addition of pXYLA or pXYLA,XKS1 plasmid. One interpretation of this result is that the proteins encoded by the xylose-sensitive genes are essential for or contribute to S288C\xe2\x80\x99s endogenous xylose utilization pathway but that they do not detectably impact xylose utilization mediated when XI is present. Alternatively, as mitochondrial mutants display fitness defects on nonfermentable carbons sources (Steinmetz et al. 2002), the detected growth defect may not be specific to xylose but apply to any nonpreferred carbon source. Using the SGA methodology, we systematically screened the contribution of nonessential yeast genes to XI/XK-mediated xylose metabolism (Figure 3A,Table S1). One striking feature of the network was the abundance of deletion mutants identified that encode proteins implicated in various aspects of translation. Similarly, genes implicated in translation were upregulated in XDH1 xylose-positive strains (Wenger et al. 2010). This result suggests that translation plays a key role in remodeling the cell for xylose utilization, which is understandable in light of the dramatic changes in the transcriptome (Bengtsson et al. 2008; Jin et al. 2002; Jin et al. 2004; Kuyper et al. 2005; Runquist et al. 2009; Salusjarvi et al. 2006; Wenger et al. 2010) and proteome (Karhumaa et al. 2009; Salusjarvi et al. 2008; Salusjarvi et al. 2003) that occurred upon xylose exposure. This result may also explain the identification of genes implicated in chromatin remodeling or transcription and protein transport. Understanding why these proteins are required for XYLA,XKS1-dependent utilization on xylose may reveal novel genetic mechanisms to improve xylose utilization of industrial strains. One of the most interesting findings of this study was the identification of four genes, BUD21, ALP1, ISC1, and RPL20B, which suppress the natural ability of yeast to utilize xylose. Deletion of these genes resulted in increased xylose consumption and growth on xylose media to levels similar to yeast containing the XI/XK system (Figures 4 and 5). Hence, there may be fitness disadvantages in retaining the ability to consume xylose that laboratory yeast has evolved to inhibit. How are the suppressors inhibiting xylose utilization? Of the four suppressors identified, bud21\xce\x94 had the greatest impact on xylose consumption (Figure 4).Bud21 is a component of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) processosome that contains U3 snoRNA (Dragon et al. 2002), and expression of BUD21 mRNA is upregulated in high-sucrose media, possibly due a strong osmotic response (Ando et al. 2006; Perez-Torrado et al. 2010).Bud21 is also involved in ribosomal protein biogenesis and processing, functions transiently repressed by stress conditions, such as those experienced during a fermentation environment (Hirasawa et al. 2010). Therefore, deletion of certain aspects of the stress response may be advantageous, allowing for bypassing some of the initial stress conditions that occur during xylose fermentation. Alternatively, both the XR/XDH and XI/XK xylose utilization pathways cause dramatic transcriptional remodeling of the cell (Bengtsson et al. 2008; Fendt and Sauer 2010; Hector et al. 2009; Jin et al. 2004; Pitkanen et al. 2003; Runquist et al. 2009; Salusjarvi et al. 2008; Salusjarvi et al. 2003; Wenger et al. 2010). Therefore, the suppressors may all be regulating some aspect of transcription or translation, which is likely the case ofRpl20b andBud21. Of course, these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive as the stress response is largely mediated by remodeling of the cells\xe2\x80\x99 transcriptome and proteome. As robust stress-tolerance is essential for yeast to efficiently ferment cellulosic hydrolysates at an industrial scale, if the suppressors are functioning by modulating aspects of stress response, they may not be an appropriate genetic strategy for the improvement of industrial yeast strains. The mechanism by which these proteins inhibit xylose utilization in yeast will require further study to assess their value for the cellulosic biofuel industry. We found that deletion of the suppressor BUD21 improved growth on xylose and that CEN.PK bud21\xce\x94 cells were able to ferment xylose and produce ethanol (Figure 6, Table 3). Unfortunately, the combination of bud21\xce\x94 and pXYLA,XKS1 did not result in further increases in ethanol production; rather, it was detrimental in the batch fermentations (Figure 6, Table 3). Though there was an initial fast burst in biomass accumulation, CEN.PK bud21\xce\x94 pXYLA,XKS1 cells plateaued in growth much sooner than CEN.PK wild-type cells. This is surprisingly as neither S288C nor CEN.PK bud21\xce\x94 transformed with pXYLA,XKS1 displayed growth defects on xylose plates (Figures 4 and 5). One possibility is that, although the cultures were aerobic, oxygen may be limiting at the high cellular concentrations of batch fermentations, effects that do not occur on plates. The exact reason for the differences in growth on plates and culture require further investigation. However, it is clear that, at least in the case of deletion of BUD21, activation of S. cerevisiae\xe2\x80\x99s natural ability to utilize and ferment xylose is not synergistic with exogenous pXYLA,XKS1 in aerobic xylose fermentations. It may be beneficial to exploit the molecular \xe2\x80\x9cbarcodes\xe2\x80\x9d of yeast mutant collections and microarray-based methods (reviewed in Smith et al. 2010) to identify mutants that improve either recombinant XI/XK or XR/XDH/XK xylose fermentation in anaerobic batch cultures that better replicate industrial-scale biofuel production. Remarkably, the performance of the CEN.PK bud21\xce\x94 strain in batch fermentation in media in which xylose is the sole carbon source was similar or better than many recombinant yeast strains (Matsushika et al. 2009). This finding suggests the addition of exogenous genes may not be the sole method of improving the xylose fermentation efficiency of Saccharomyces; rather, efforts should focus on identifying and optimizing the endogenous xylose utilization pathway in yeast.

3,['William F. Sheridan'],"September 15, 2011.",Variable Transposition of Eight Maize Activator (Ac) Elements Located on the Short Arm of Chromosome 1,"b'Eight Activator (Ac) transposable elements mapped to the maize chromosome arm 1S were assessed for Ac transposition rates. For each of the Ac stocks, plants homozygous for the single Ac element and the Ds reporter r1-sc:m3 on chromosome 10 were crossed as females by a homozygous r1-sc:m3 tester color-converted W22 line. The resulting ears produced mostly coarsely spotted kernels and a low frequency of either near-colorless fine-spotted kernels or nonspotted kernels. The relative frequency of these two types of near-colorless kernels differed among the eight Ac stocks. The extent to which increased Ac dosage results in nonspotted kernels may be Ac-specific.

These differences might possibly result from structural differences among the Ac elements. Because one pair of Ac elements derived from Ac33 on chromosome arm 5S differed about 13-fold in transposition frequency and a second pair of Ac elements derived from Ac12 on chromosome arm 1S differed about 3-fold in transposition frequency, this is not a likely explanation for all eight Ac elements.

In addition, the delayed timing of Ac transposition in tissues containing increased Ac copy number provides a means of assessing the occurrence of an Ac transposition event by observing the size of pigmented sectors in the aleurone and embryo tissues of kernels. A collection of Ac-containing, near-isogenic, color-converted W22 inbred lines was produced by Kolkman et al. (2005); these included 41 precisely mapped Ac elements. The present report concerns 8 of these lines, all containing Ac elements mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1. The results presented here concern the variability in transposition frequency of these Ac elements observed while pursuing a regional mutagenesis program on this chromosome arm. For each of the Ac stocks, plants homozygous for the single Ac element and the Ds reporter r1-sc:m3 on chromosome 10 were crossed as females by a homozygous r1-sc:m3 tester color-converted W22 line (Figure 1). Crossing scheme to produce finely spotted kernels. The chromosome constitutions of the embryos are shown. In most cases, the Ac element does not transpose and the embryo contains a single copy of the Ac element, whereas the aleurone cells of the endosperm contain two copies (one Ac from each of the two polar nuclei of the embryo sac). This dosage results in coarse spotting of the kernel aleurones. In a few cases, the Ac element duplicates, and subsequently, one copy transposes to a new site. When both copies are transmitted to the embryo sac (whether they are linked as shown in the figure or are on different chromosomes), the embryo will have two copies of the Ac element and the aleurone will have four copies, resulting in a finely spotted aleurone. The ears borne on plants homozygous for the Ac element produce mostly coarsely spotted kernels and a low frequency of near-colorless kernels. The coarsely spotted kernels display the pattern of colored sectors expected when the nuclei of the female gametophyte contain a single copy of the Ac element, whereas the near-colorless kernels manifest either a transposition event resulting in an increased dosage of the Ac element in these nuclei or the absence of an Ac element. Increased dosage may result from the Ac element replicating prior to its transposition and the subsequent presence of both the donor Ac element and the tr-Ac element in the functional megaspore that develops into the female gametophyte (embryo sac) (Greenblatt 1968). The increased dosage of the Ac element results in the delay in the development of the fine spotting of colored sectors in these kernels (see Figure 2). A total of 394 scoreable ears were screened for near-colorless kernels. Each such kernel was scored as a transposition event and was removed from the ear and examined for fine spots under magnification. The kernels were sorted into two groups: spotted kernels containing at least one fine spot on either the aleurone or the embryo, and nonspotted kernels lacking any colored spots on both aleurone and the embryo (Figure 2). Results of crossing an Ac stock as shown in Figure 1 and generating transposed Acs. An F1 ear produced by crossing a stock homozygous for mon00068::Ac by the r1-sc:m3 reporter tester line. Most of the kernels have an aleurone layer containing two copies of the Ac element and are coarsely spotted. A small number of kernels have an aleurone layer containing four copies of the Ac element (two copies of the original Ac element and two copies of the newly transposed Ac element) and are finely spotted (near-colorless). Initially, the transposition frequencies were calculated on the basis of transposition events per ear. The number of ears scored for each of the Ac stocks ranged from 24 to 77. Among the eight Ac stocks, the mean values ranged from a high frequency of 9.67 fine-spotted kernels and 6.34 nonspotted kernels per ear (bti00252::Ac) to a low frequency of 0.58 fine-spotted kernels and 0.03 nonspotted kernels per ear (mon00106::Ac) (supporting information, Table S1, Figure S1). Subsequently, all of the kernels on the scored ears were weighed to provide an estimate of the total number of kernels per ear. The total estimated number of kernels examined was approximately 108,000. These data were used to calculate an estimated frequency of fine-spotted and nonspotted kernels per 1000 kernels for each of the eight Ac elements. The mean values ranged from a high frequency of 38.80 fine-spotted kernels and 26.28 nonspotted kernels per 1000 kernels (bti00252::Ac) to a low frequency of 2.15 fine-spotted kernels and 0.15 nonspotted kernels per 1000 kernels (mon00106::Ac) (Table 1). The frequency of transposition of Ac elements per 1000 kernels for the individual families of the eight Ac elements is shown in Table S2. An average transposition frequency of 2 to 4% (20 to 40 per 1000 kernels) was reported by Kolkman et al. (2005) based on their examination of approximately 12,400 kernels generated from 10 different Ac lines. No data were provided for any of the individual lines. In this report, the Ac transposition frequency as evidenced by the frequency of near-colorless, fine-spotted kernels ranged from 0.215% to 3.880%. When the near-colorless nonspotted kernels are included in the calculations, then the frequency of Ac transposition ranges from 0.230% to 6.508%. Kolkman et al. (2005) noted differences in the degree of variation in Ac-mediated Ds variegation patterns (the size of sectors or spots) in kernels homozygous for independent Ac insertions. These researchers further noted that, inasmuch as all of the Ac elements they studied were in near-isogenic lines using the same Ds reporter, it was not likely that the variations they observed resulted from differences in the reporter gene or segregating modifier loci. The size of spots on self-pollinated kernels on ears of plants homozygous for the eight different Ac stocks differed only slightly in size, and there was no obvious relationship with their Ac transposition frequency. The same degree of similarity of spotting size was observed on kernels on ears of plants homozygous for Ac elements that were crossed as females by the reporter stock. When plants homozygous for Ac elements were crossed by pollen of the reporter stock, the relative frequency of fine-spotted to nonspotted kernels differed among the eight Ac elements (Table 1, Figure S1). In the case of the two most distally located Ac elements (mon03080::Ac and bti95004::Ac), the number of nonspotted kernels per 1000 kernels was greater than the number of spotted kernels per 1000 kernels. However, for the six most proximally located Ac elements, the frequency of spotted kernels was greater than the frequency of nonspotted kernels. The relative frequency of nonspotted kernels may depend on the level of transposase transcription by the Ac elements, and this level may vary among the Ac elements at both their original sites on chromosome arm 1S and at the target sites of the tr-Ac elements. Where the sum of the resulting transposase levels is high enough, then the negative dosage effect (Heinlein 1996; Kunze and Weil 2002) exerted upon transposition of Ds from the reporter locus may suppress all spotting, even though Ac elements are present in the kernel. However, inasmuch as the differences in spotting frequency are a reflection of the frequency of the transposition of the Ds element from the r1-sc:m3 reporter locus, these differences may not be directly linked to the frequency of transposition of the Ac element. Whereas the accessibility of the transposase to the Ds element is likely to be similar in these isogenic lines, the accessibility of the Ac element to transposase may differ among the Ac elements and may be influenced by its position in the chromosome. Consequently, the extent to which an increased Ac dosage results in nonspotted kernels may be Ac element\xe2\x80\x93specific but not directly related to Ac transposition frequency. The same considerations regarding the use of isogenic lines containing the same Ds reporter apply to the present study wherein significant differences in Ac transposition frequencies are documented (Table 1, Table S3, Table S4). It was earlier noted by Kolkman et al. (2005) that previous studies have indicated that methylation plays an important role in altering transcription patterns of Ac and that, therefore, the variation in Ac-mediated excision patterns of the Ds element is likely a result of differences in the transcriptional activity of the different Ac elements and that their mapped Ac lines may be useful for analyzing \xe2\x80\x9ccis-acting elements that control gene expression throughout the genome.\xe2\x80\x9d The differences in Ac transposition frequency reported here might possibly result from structural differences among the Ac elements. However, this is not a likely explanation for all eight cases. An examination of Table 1 reveals that the source of both mon00106::Ac and mon00068::Ac was Ac33 on chromosome arm 5S, yet their transposition frequencies differed about 13-fold. Likewise, the source of both mon00192::Ac and bti00252::Ac was Ac12 on chromosome arm 1S, yet their transposition frequencies differed about 3-fold. The data presented here support the notion that the differences in transposition frequency of these eight mapped Ac elements may be a reflection of variability in Ac transcription or accessibility of transposase to the Ac element, resulting from differences in the chromatin environments wherein the Ac elements are located.

Wine yeast strains have specific abilities to grow and ferment under stressful conditions compared with other strains, but the genetic basis underlying these traits is unknown. Understanding how sequence variation influences such phenotypes is a major challenge to address adaptation mechanisms of wine yeast. We aimed to identify the genetic basis of fermentation traits and gain insight into their relationships with variations in gene expression among yeast strains. We combined fermentation trait QTL mapping and expression profiling of fermenting cells in a segregating population from a cross between a wine yeast derivative and a laboratory strain. We report the identification of QTL for various fermentation traits (fermentation rates, nitrogen utilization, metabolites production) as well as expression QTL (eQTL). We found that many transcripts mapped to several eQTL hotspots and that two of them overlapped with QTL for fermentation traits. A QTL controlling the maximal fermentation rate and nitrogen utilization overlapping with an eQTL hotspot was dissected. We functionally demonstrated that an allele of the ABZ1 gene, localized in the hotspot and involved in p-aminobenzoate biosynthesis, controls the fermentation rate through modulation of nitrogen utilization. Our data suggest that the laboratory strain harbors a defective ABZ1 allele, which triggers strong metabolic and physiological alterations responsible for the generation of the eQTL hotspot. They also suggest that a number of gene expression differences result from some alleles that trigger major physiological disturbances.Industrial wine yeast strains exhibit specific traits making them suitable for alcoholic fermentation. These yeasts are specifically adapted to stressful conditions and can ferment efficiently under conditions of high ethanol concentrations, low pH, nutrient starvation, while producing suitable metabolites, especially aroma compounds. Although a large phenotypic diversity has been described, the molecular basis remains largely unknown. Various molecular mechanisms may contribute to wine yeast adaptation, including gene deletions or amplifications, chromosome polyploidy (Dunham et al. 2002; Dunn et al. 2005; Infante et al. 2003; Perez-Ortin et al. 2002; Rachidi et al. 1999), and nucleotide polymorphisms (Borneman et al. 2008; Doniger et al. 2008; Goffeau et al. 1996; Kellis et al. 2003; Liti et al. 2009; Schacherer et al. 2009; Wei et al. 2007). Analysis of the complete genome sequence of a commercial wine yeast also revealed that new (non-Saccharomyces) genes arising from horizontal gene transfer were present in the wine strains (Novo et al. 2009). Linking genetic variation with phenotypic diversity will help to increase our understanding of the adaptation of yeast to industrial stressful environments and will facilitate strain improvement through breeding and genetic engineering. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping is a proven approach to map the genetic variation responsible for quantitative traits in S. cerevisiae. It was successfully applied to high-temperature growth (Sinha et al. 2008; Sinha et al. 2006; Steinmetz et al. 2002), sporulation (Ben-Ari et al. 2006; Deutschbauer and Davis 2005; Gerke et al. 2006; Katou et al. 2009), cell morphology (Nogami et al. 2007), drug sensitivity (Kim and Fay, 2007), ethanol tolerance and growth (Hu et al. 2007; Katou et al. 2009; Smith and Kruglyak 2008), and flocculation (Brauer et al. 2006). QTL approaches have also been used to dissect the molecular basis of several wine yeast metabolic traits such as acetic acid production, hydrogen sulphide production, and release of volatile phenol (Marullo et al. 2006). Several studies have highlighted the role of expression variations on associated phenotypes in yeast (Brown et al. 2008; Cavalieri et al. 2000; Fay et al. 2004). Variations in expression between wine strains have been reported in various genome-wide analyses (Rossignol 2004; Zuzuarregui et al. 2006). However, their impact on strain properties is poorly understood. Genomic approaches to variations in gene expression have been used to establish relationships between differences in transcript abundance and genetic polymorphisms via the mapping of expression QTL (eQTL) (Jansen and Nap 2001; Brem et al. 2002; Yvert et al. 2003; Brem and Kruglyak 2005; Ronald and Akey 2007; Ansel et al. 2008)). Combining the search of eQTL with that of QTL of industrially relevant traits may be of interest to gain insight into the relationships between expression variations and wine yeast traits. Indeed when an eQTL colocalizes with a phenotypic QTL, one can hypothesize that a common polymorphism controls transcription differences and the physiological trait. Here, we report an integrated approach where we searched for both phenotypic fermentation QTL and eQTL in the laboratory yeast strain S288c and a haploid derivative of the EC1118 industrial wine strain. We identified QTL for various fermentation traits, including kinetic traits, as well as eQTL for many transcripts. We show that eQTL display hotspot regions that control many transcripts and interestingly, two of them overlap with fermentation traits QTL. We functionally characterized a QTL that controlled the maximal fermentation rate and showed that a gene involved in p-aminobenzoate synthesis (ABZ1), probably defective in the strain S288C, modulates the fermentation rate by controlling nitrogen utilization. The relationships between structural alteration of ABZ1 and eQTL hotspot generation are discussed.'","b'The genetic basis of the phenotypic diversity of yeast is still poorly understood.

Indeed when an eQTL colocalizes with a phenotypic QTL, one can hypothesize that a common polymorphism controls transcription differences and the physiological trait. Here, we report an integrated approach where we searched for both phenotypic fermentation QTL and eQTL in the laboratory yeast strain S288c and a haploid derivative of the EC1118 industrial wine strain. We identified QTL for various fermentation traits, including kinetic traits, as well as eQTL for many transcripts. We show that eQTL display hotspot regions that control many transcripts and interestingly, two of them overlap with fermentation traits QTL. We functionally characterized a QTL that controlled the maximal fermentation rate and showed that a gene involved in p-aminobenzoate synthesis (ABZ1), probably defective in the strain S288C, modulates the fermentation rate by controlling nitrogen utilization. The relationships between structural alteration of ABZ1 and eQTL hotspot generation are discussed. The two parental strains compared in this study are the standard S288c (MAT\xce\xb1; SUC2; gal2) strain and a haploid derivative of the industrial EC1118 (HO/ho) wine yeast strain, which is referred to as 59A (MATa; ho). This strain is phototrophic and has fermentation properties close to the diploid EC1118 strain (see Figure 1). The strains BY4742 (MAT\xce\xb1; his3\xce\x941; leu2\xce\x940; lys2\xce\x940; ura3\xce\x940 and BY4742\xe2\x88\x86ABZ1 (Mat\xce\xb1; his3\xce\x941; leu2\xce\x940; lys2\xce\x940; ura3\xce\x940; YNR033w::kanMX4) were used for hemizygous constructions. Fermentation profiles of industrial and laboratory strains. Fermentation rate profiles of the industrial wine yeast EC1118 (gray squares), its haploid derivative 59A (black diamonds), the laboratory strain S288C (gray line), and the hybrid Z59S (black line). Fermentation experiments and precultures were carried out at 28\xc2\xb0C on synthetic MS300 medium, which mimics a natural must described in Bely et al. (1990). After preculture in 125 ml shake flasks for 24 h, fermentations were performed in 1.2 l fermenters equipped with airlocks to maintain anaerobiosis and with constant stirring. Hybrid strains BY4742\xe2\x88\x86ABZ1/59A and BY4742/59A\xe2\x88\x86ABZ1 were constructed for the functional characterization of the ABZ1 candidate gene via a reciprocal hemizygosity analysis. The BY4742\xe2\x88\x86ABZ1strain, which isogenic to S288c but with a copy of the ABZ1 gene deleted, was obtained from the Euroscarff society. The copy of ABZ1 in the 59A strain was deleted and replaced with a KanMX4 deletion module using the short-flanking homology PCR (SFH-PCR) technique (Schiestl and Gietz 1989). The two custom 60-mer primers used begin with 40 nucleotides that are identical to the upstream or the downstream region of ABZ1 followed by 20 nucleotides that can amplify the KanMX4 module, ABZ1 forward: ATGCTGTCCGATACAATTGACACAAAGCAACAACAGCAACTTCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC; and ABZ1 reverse: CTACATGAAAATTTGCAAGTTGCTCTCCAACTTGGTGTACGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG. After transformation using the lithium acetate transformation protocol of Schiestl and Gietz (1989), yeasts were grown with YEPD plus geneticin (200 \xc2\xb5g/l) overnight at 28\xc2\xb0C to select cells with the KanMX4 integrated module. Clones were finally tested for integration by PCR on genomic DNA with the primers ABZ1 forwardctrl: TTATCGGTGCGGCAATAAAG and ABZ1 reversectrl: TATGTGACCGTCAGGACG. To characterize the fermentation parameters, the fermenters were automatically weighed every 20 min and the rate of CO2 production was calculated from the weight loss by a method of polynomial smoothing. The number of cells was determined with an electronic particle counter (Beckman Coulter). At the end of fermentation, samples were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an HPX-87H ion-exclusion column (Bio-Rad) to assess the sugars (glucose, fructose), the organic acids (succinic acid, acetic acid, pyruvic acid), and alcohols (glycerol, ethanol) according to the procedure described by Calull et al. (1992). Amino acids were separated by ion-exchange chromatography on an anionic Ultropac-8 lithium-form resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a Chromakon 400 (Kontron) and a Biochrom 20 analyzer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Amino acids were detected by reaction with nihydrin. Ammonia was measured using the enzymatic method from Bergmeyer and Beutler (1990) based on its conversion into glutamate by the glutamate dehydrogenase. Fermentation parameters of the parental strains were determined from five independent fermentations and from duplicated fermentations for the other strains (segregants, hemizygous strains). Metabolites were measured in five biological replicates for the parental strains and in duplicate for the segregants, except the amino acids, which were determined from a single fermentation. Microarray hybridization and image analysis was performed at the Biochip Platform in Toulouse (http://biopuces.genotoul.fr). The microarrays were obtained by spotting in duplicate the 6308 oligonucleotides (70-mer) from the yeast genome Oligoset (Operon) onto UltraGAP chips. Gene expression was analyzed for five independent cultures of each parent and one culture of each segregant. RNA was isolated at the midtime of fermentation when half of the sugar present in the medium was consumed (equivalent to 45 g CO2), and then labeled with the Chipshot direct labeling and cleanup kit (Promega). Each sample labeled with the Cy3 dye was compared with a common reference pool labeled with Cy5 dye and composed of a mix of equivalent concentration of the RNA of each segregant of the population (star design). Hybridizations were done twice and thus technical replicates are available for each measurement. Data analysis was performed using the R 2.9.2 software and the limma package (R Development Core Team 2010; Smyth 2005, Smyth et al. 2005; Smyth and Speed 2003). Within-array normalization was performed using the print-tip-loess method followed by a quantile method for between-slide normalization. For each measurement, the two technical replicates were averaged. Gene expression between the two parental strains (2 \xc3\x97 5 microarrays) was compared using t-tests. Differentially expressed genes were defined by filtering on adjusted P = 0.01 to control the false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini et al. 2001). For linkage analysis in the population of segregants, transcripts with a low signal-to-noise ratio were filtered out: we required the mean red (Cy5) signal to be three times greater than the mean background signal (Cy5). The complete data set is available on the Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number GSE26437) (Edgar et al. 2002). An analysis of the correlation between gene expression and phenotype parameters was carried out using the Spearman correlation coefficient and the associated statistical test, followed by a correction of the multiplicity using Benjamini and Hochberg procedure. We selected genes with correlation coefficients > 0.6 and adjusted P < 0.05 to control the FDR. Genomic DNA was isolated, fragmented, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix YGS98 microarrays as previously described (Winzeler et al. 1999). This procedure was applied three times for the parental strains S288c and 59A and one time for each of the 30 segregants. Probes with a unique match on the S288c genome were then screened to identify biallelic markers using the same statistical procedure as Brem et al. (2002). First, probes identified as low perfect-match (PM) vs. mismatch (MM) hybridizers to S288c genomic DNA were discarded. All further analyses were performed on normalized log(PM/MM) values. We selected probe pairs that had high hybridization differences between S288c and 59A using the Z and z statistics described in Brem et al. (2002). A second test based on a clustering algorithm was used to select probe pairs for evidence of 2:2 segregation in the segregating population. Genotypes were then inferred from cluster assignments as described in Brem et al. (2002). This resulted in the selection of 2465 probes. The probes were further filtered using the genomic sequences of the parental strains S288c and 59A. For each probe, the presence of polymorphisms in the 59A genome was confirmed. We used Illumina high-throughput sequencing to obtain SNP information for 59A. Genomic DNA of the strain 59A was sequenced using Illumina Genome Analyzer II technology (Illumina, Inc.) with paired reads of 36 bp using standard manufacturer protocols. Read sequences (deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive as study SRP004704) were aligned to the S288c genome with MAQ (ver. 0.7.1) (Li et al. 2008) using default parameters to detect SNP. This filtering step resulted in a map of 1834 markers used in the linkage analysis. For each phenotype and each expression trait, linkage analysis was performed using a normal model with the Haley-Knott regression method implemented in the R/qtl package (Broman et al. 2003). Logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were computed for each marker every 2.5 cM. An interval estimate of the location of each QTL or eQTL was obtained as the 1-LOD support interval: the region in which the LOD score is within 1 unit of the peak LOD score. Statistical significance was assessed by random permutation of the phenotypes or expression levels relative to the genotype data. For eQTL, the permutation was performed 10 times, and the average number of transcripts showing linkage at a specific LOD score was used to calculate FDR. For each phenotypic QTL, 1000 permutations were used to calculate an individual LOD score threshold and FDR. A database named GenYeasTrait, which is dedicated to the analysis of QTL and eQTL data, was developed using the Gmod/Gbrowse software version 2.15 (Stein et al. 2002). It includes the annotation of the S288c genome from the Saccharomyces Genome Database, SNPs detected from the comparison of the 59A strain sequence with the S288c reference genome, and the fermentation and expression QTL of the project. The database can be queried by using the Gbrowse interface, which allows user friendly graphical representations of features on chromosomes and facilitates data exploration. It is available at http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/genyeastrait/. To generate a population of segregants for QTL analysis, the S288C laboratory strain and the 59A strain (a haploid derivative of the EC1118 strain) were used for crossing (Figure 1). The fermentation profile of the haploid derivative 59A does not however perfectly overlap with the EC1118 pattern. Such variation is consistent with the known heterozygosity of the wine yeast EC1118 genome that was shown to contain 0.2% of heterozygous SNP (Novo et al. 2009). The hybrid (Z59S) obtained by crossing 59A with S288C displays a fermentation profile intermediate between the two parental strains (Figure 1). Fermentation rate profiles obtained in a synthetic medium (MS300) that mimics natural grape musts provided relevant criteria to characterize the fermentation capacity of the strains. As shown in Figure 1, the two parental strains exhibit very different fermentation profiles with a much higher maximum fermentation rate (Rmax) for 59A compared with S288c. Furthermore, the 59A strain also shows a higher fermentation rate at 50% of sugar utilization (R50) with a consequently shorter duration of fermentation duration (Fd). All of these data are consistent with a higher fermentation capacity of the 59A wine strain derivative compared vs. the laboratory strain. Under such fermentation conditions, the growth phase is restricted to the period of increase of the fermentation rate until Rmax, and then cells are subsequently fermented in a stationary phase (Rossignol et al. 2003). The zygote Z59S was used to generated a population of haploid segregants. The spores obtained had a low viability with 54% viable. The proportion of asci with four viable spores was low (only 15%), and a majority (around 50%) had three viable spores. We kept only one complete tetrad in the analyzed population, and the other segregants were selected from 20 different asci. The 30 haploid progenies where characterized under the fermentation conditions previously described. To describe the fermentation capacity, we considered the fermentation rate at three different stages of fermentation: Rmax, R50 (fermentation rate at 50% fermentation), and R70 (fermentation rate at 70% fermentation). Other fermentation traits, such as fermentation duration (Fd) and cellular population (Cp), were taken into account. We also considered metabolites, such as the amount of assimilated nitrogen (Nass), glycerol (gly), acetic acid (ace), succinic acid (suc) and pyruvic acid (pyr) (Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3). We observed a high variability in the segregants fermentation profiles (supporting information, Figure S1). Several traits values (Rmax, R50, gly, pyr, ace) were roughly normally distributed within the population (P > 0.05, Shapiro-Wilk normality test), supporting a polygenic determinism of these phenotypes (Figure S2). The amount of assimilated nitrogen and, to some extent, R70 and Fd, displayed a bimodal distribution suggesting a possible control by a major locus. Furthermore, all of these parameters, except R50, displayed values outside the parental range. This transgressive segregation indicates that alleles with opposite effects were present in the parental strains. To investigate potential relationships among fermentation traits, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed (Figure 2). The projection on two principal axes preserves 87% of the information and explains 68% and 19% of this variation, respectively. This analysis shows that Fd, R70, and R50 are negatively correlated. This is consistent with the idea that the fermentation rate during the stationary phase strongly determines the overall duration of fermentation. The second axis also distinguishes the final cell population Cp and R70 variables (or Cp and Rmax) and the Cp and Fd variables which are not correlated. This suggests that the fermentation rate is independent from the total cell population. Finally, the fermentation rate at all stages (Rm, R50, and R70) was positively correlated with the assimilated nitrogen Nass. These data indicate that cell capacity to use nitrogen has a strong impact on the fermentation rate. This is consistent with previous reports on the role of nitrogen availability in fermentation rate (Bely et al. 1990, Varela et al. 2004). The laboratory strain has a poor ability to consume nitrogen, which was associated to a weak fermentation capacity (Figure S1 and Figure S2). Principal component analysis (PCA) of kinetic and metabolic traits. This analysis shows that all kinetic parameters are correlated. The first component shows that Nass and fermentation rates (Rmax, R50, R70) are negatively correlated with Fd. The second component shows that Cp is not correlated with the other parameters. To assess the gene expression level of the entire genome of the segregants and parental strains, we performed a transcriptome analysis. The physiological condition chosen for analyzing gene expression was the point of midfermentation (50% of fermentation process). At this stage, cells are in stationary phase and are experiencing a general stress due to nutrient starvation and alcohol accumulation (about 6% at this stage). Under these physiological conditions, the transcriptome is stable and expected to provide a relevant picture regarding the capacity to resist to such stressful conditions (Rossignol et al. 2003). The transcriptomes of both parents and each segregant were compared with the mean transcriptome of the population (see Materials and Methods). We first observed that 2184 genes were differentially expressed between the parental strains at P < 0.01 and 262 genes up- or downregulated with a ratio higher than 2 (see Materials and Methods). This indicates that a large fraction of the genes in the genome are differentially expressed, with only a small subset displaying strong variations in agreement with previous reports (Brem et al. 2002). Among the top 100 genes that were strongly overexpressed in the parental strains (Table S3), 59A exhibited a large set of stress- and anaerobiosis-inducible cell wall genes from the PAU and DAN families. These genes are known to be highly expressed during alcoholic fermentation (Rossignol et al. 2003); however, given that several of them can cross-hybridize, it is not possible to identify unambiguously the set of genes really overexpressed. In the laboratory strain, there was a massive overexpression of 76 retrotransposons in agreement with a reshaping of retrotransposons in S288c and an amplification of Ty1 in the laboratory strain compared with EC1118 (Novo et al. 2009). Another striking feature in the laboratory strain was the strong overexpression of several genes involved in the stress response (SPS100, HSP30, HSP12). To address the relationships between fermentation phenotypes and gene expression, we carried out a correlation analysis (see Materials and Methods). The expression of a large number of genes exhibited significant correlation with kinetic parameters (Table 1 and Figure S4). Genes with the strongest correlation with Rmax were involved in nitrogen metabolism (MEP2, PUT1, MAE1), protein synthesis and degradation (MAP1, SUP35, PRE1), or Ty protein. Several of these genes were also correlated with the amount of assimilated nitrogen Nass. Expression of these genes is controlled by nitrogen catabolic repression (NCR), and they are induced at the beginning of the stationary phase in response to nitrogen depletion (Rossignol et al. 2003). Their correlation with Rmax and Nass is consistent with their control by nitrogen availability and the role of nitrogen in fermentation rate (Figure 2 and Table 1). The genes that correlated with the fermentation rate at midfermentation (R50) and at 70% fermentation (R70) were very similar. Several genes involved in thiamine metabolism (THI3, THI4, and PET18) displayed a high level of correlation as did the actin gene ACT1, and a cell wall gene (SCW4). Correlation was also seen, though to a lesser extent, for genes involved in nitrogen metabolism (MEP2, PUT1, MAP1). The genes correlated with fermentation duration (Fd) were mostly consistent with those that correlated with R70 or R50, but with the opposite relationship (these two traits are negatively correlated in PCA; see Figure 2). Peculiarly, this included various genes involved in the stress response (CUP1, HSP12, HSP30, CTT1, SSA4, ATC1) which were positively correlated with the fermentation duration Fd, indicating that a high stress response was associated with a low fermentation capacity. Several members of the PAU/DAN family previously observed to be overexpressed in the industrial strain were correlated with nitrogen assimilation, and to some extent, with Rmax and R50. For the other fermentation traits, such as cell population and amount of metabolites, weak or no correlation was found with gene expression. This was probably because the stage at which gene expression was analyzed (50% of fermentation progress) was not appropriate to address these parameters, which are mainly associated with the growth phase. To genotype the entire population of this study, we hybridized the genomic DNA of the 30 segregants and parental strains on high-density olignonucleotide microarrays Affymetrix YGS98 (Winzeler et al. 1998). Using the genome sequences of the two strains, we obtained a dense coverage of the genome with 1834 physical markers and an average spacing of 6.6 kbp between each marker (Figure S5). The markers are expected to be reliable as we checked that each marker corresponded to a SNP in the genome sequence of the strain 59A. The coverage of the genome was rather homogeneous, with only few gaps on chromosome III and on the right arm of chromosome XIV. These regions of low coverage also have low SNP density that may explain the reduced frequency of markers (see Gbrowse at http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/genyeastrait/). The distribution of the markers in the 30 segregants was used to build a recombination map (Figure S6). Only very few chromosomes did not display crossover. We used the single tetrad to estimate the number of crossovers and found a frequency of 70 crossovers per meiosis, a number close to previous reports (Brem et al. 2002; Cubillos et al. 2011). The parental genomes markers were evenly distributed in the population, with 49.8% originating from the strain 59A and 50.2% from S288C. We then used these markers to map QTL for the different fermentation and metabolic parameters using an interval mapping approach (see Materials and Methods). We obtained a significant LOD score threshold for six different phenotypes. QTL were detected for Rmax on chromosome XIV, for the cell population Cp on chromosome XVI, for the assimilated nitrogen Nass on chromosome XIV, and for the fermentation duration Fd and R70 on chromosome II (Figure 3). A QTL for metabolite levels was found only for succinate production with a clear QTL located on chromosome XIV and one additional potential QTL, with a LOD score below the threshold, on chromosome II (Figure 3). We observed that QTL for various fermentation traits overlapped (Table 2). This concerned a QTL for the maximum fermentation rate and a QTL for the assimilated nitrogen that overlapped in a 37.5 kb region on chromosome XIV (664875 kb to 702375 kb). These results are consistent with the previous PCA results that highlighted relationships between nitrogen utilization Nass and Rmax (Figure 2). Two other parameters, R70 and Fd, mapped to a common region on chromosome II, whereas R50 and succinate production had a potential linkage on the same region with a LOD score just below the threshold. Careful examination of the LOD score profiles suggests that the QTL for succinate is distinct from the R70 QTL (Figure S7). The overlap of QTL for R70, R50, and Fd is consistent with the known correlations between these parameters. QTL mapping of kinetics traits and succinate production. The concatenated chromosomes are displayed on the X-axis and LOD score values on the Y-axis. The significant LOD score thresholds are indicated by a red line. Each peak of the LOD curve corresponds to the LOD value of linkage between a marker located in the X position and the value of each trait. Further details of QTL are in Table 2. In parallel, to identify loci controlling gene expression, the yeast genome was scanned for markers by gene expression linkages. We treated the expression signals from the whole data set of 4398 genes as quantitative traits without additional filtering and subjected them to linkage analysis using the set of markers. In doing so, a test statistic evaluating each marker-by-gene association was computed to detect the number of eQTL with different LOD score thresholds. For each significance threshold we then estimated a corresponding FDR using a permutation approach (see Materials and Methods). Depending on the LOD score threshold used, we could detect from 92 to 897 eQTL. Ninety-two eQTL were detected with a LOD score threshold of 4.5 (FDR of 0.26). A less stringent LOD score threshold of 3.5 (FDR of 0.50) was associated with 409 eQTL, and a LOD score threshold of 3.0 (FDR of 0.63) was associated with 897 eQTL. The high FDR associated with LOD scores was not surprising given the small population size of segregants used in our analysis. Indeed, all previous eQTL studies in yeast were performed using larger population sizes (Brem and Kruglyak 2005). The main interest in this study was to use the QTL analysis to gain an initial insight into the eQTL architecture and its relationship with fermentation QTL. We therefore decided to analyze the data set using a permissive LOD score threshold of 3.5. The physical location of eQTL across the genome was plotted against the physical location of genes that were differentially deregulated and possessed an eQTL using this LOD score (Figure 4). The point in the diagonal indicates cis-linkages, i.e., meaning that the QTL linkage peak coincides with the physical location of the open reading frame for the expression trait. All of the eQTL located outside this diagonal represent trans-linkages with a linkage peaks at loci distant from the physical location of the open reading frames. We detected only a limited number, eight, of cis-associations visible on the diagonal line in Figure 4A. Among them, four ASP3 genes (ASP3-1, ASP3-2, ASP3-3, and ASP3-4) displayed a local regulation consistent with the known deletion of these genes in the industrial strain (Novo et al. 2009). Surprisingly, by observing within trans-eQTL distribution, we noticed the linkage of many transcripts to the same chromosomal region, which gave rise to vertical alignments of eQTL (Figure 4A). Seven such eQTL trans-bands could be observed and localized on chromosomes II, IV, XI, XII, XIV, XV and XVI. This distribution of eQTL corresponds to hotspot regions, which contain loci exerting a trans-control on the expression of a large set of genes (Figure 4A). These trans-regulatory bands were also visible at more stringent threshold levels (Figure S8), and this strengthens the notion of a role of these loci in the variation of expression of a large set of transcripts. The number of eQTL linked to these regions ranged from 12 on chromosome XVI to 42 on chromosome XIV (Figure 4 and Table S4). The position of individual eQTL can be examined using the Gbrowse interface at http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/genyeastrait/. Genomic view of eQTL distribution and relationships with QTL for fermentation traits. A) Genomic view of eQTL mapping. The X-axis represents the genome location of markers, and the Y-axis represents the genome location of the regulated linked genes on concatenated chromosomes. EQTL values with LOD scores greater than 3.5 are displayed. The diagonal pattern is called \xe2\x80\x9ccis-eQTL band\xe2\x80\x9d and represents an association between the expression level of a gene and the genotype at the gene\xe2\x80\x99s locus. Multiple vertical bands, called \xe2\x80\x9ctrans-eQTL bands,\xe2\x80\x9d illustrate associations between the expression of many genes and a single locus. B) Overlapping of eQTL and QTL for fermentation traits. The scale below the figure indicates the genomic position across the genome in mega base pairs (Mpb). We can observe the overlapping of the hotspot on chromosome II with Fd, R70, R50, and succinate (succ) parameters and the overlap of the hotspot located on chromosome XIV with Rmax and Nass. QTL for traits with LOD scores just below the threshold are shown in blue. To determine whether the chromosomal loci detected in the QTL/eQTL analysis have an impact both on fermentation phenotypes and the massive deregulation of gene expression we examined the possible relationships between eQTL and QTL of fermentation phenotypes. Figure 4B displays the positions of fermentation QTL and the number of eQTL detected across the genome to visualize the hotspots in parallel. Among the seven detected eQTL hotspot regions, two overlap with fermentation QTL. The hotspot located on chromosome II overlaps with QTL involved in the variations of Fd, R70, and succinate production. The 63 kb hotspot on chromosome XIV overlaps with QTL associated with variations in Rmax and Nass (Figure 4B). The colocalization of the two fermentation QTL with the eQTL hotspots suggests that a common regulator affects both the expression of the set of genes and the fermentation traits. As variations in parameters such as nitrogen assimilation are expected to be associated with strong physiological changes, their coupling with massive changes in gene expression is unsurprising. In addition, some genes, whose expression was previously found to be correlated with the fermentation parameters, are linked to the same hotspot (e.g., the stress-responsive genes HSP12, HSP30, a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

d SPS100 are correlated with Fd and R70 and have a linkage on the chromosome-II hotspot). We explored the hotspot covering the region from 635 kbp to 732 kbp on chromosome XIV to identify putative candidate genes that could be involved in the control of Rmax and Nass. We used the genome sequence of the 59A strain to search for genes with either nonsynonymous SNP leading to amino acid changes in the coding region or with SNPs in the regulatory region and a self-eQTL linkage in the hotspot. Genes potentially connected to nitrogen metabolism were preferentially considered. We found a relevant candidate gene, ABZ1, which codes for a p-aminobenzoate synthase. This gene harbors 13 SNPs in the coding sequence and 5 of these are nonsynonymous substitutions (see http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/genyeastrait). ABZ1 is also involved in methyl donor synthesis required for biosynthesis of methionine and nucleotides. The ABZ1 gene is therefore connected to the nitrogen biosynthetic pathways and was considered to be worth for further investigations. We used a reciprocal-hemizygosity analysis described by Steinmetz et al. (2002) to investigate the impact of the ABZ1 allele on the fermentation phenotype. We constructed an isogenic pair of strains by crossing 59A with BY4742\xce\x94abz1 on one side and a 59A strain, in which the ABZ1 gene was deleted (59A\xce\x94abz1), with BY4742 on the other side. The two diploid strains differ only in their ABZ1 alleles. In each strain, only one allele of ABZ1 is functional, originating from either BY4742 or 59A. The fermentation profiles obtained with these two strains revealed that the ABZ1 allele has a strong impact on fermentation behavior (Figure 5A). Rmax was strongly decreased whereas Fd was increased when the hemizygous strain carried the ABZ1 allele originating from BY4742. These results are a first confirmation of the implication of ABZ1 in the control of the fermentation rate. The lower fermentation rate with the ABZ1 allele from the BY4742 strain suggests that this allele could be associated with a defect in p-aminobenzoate synthesis. Actually, the synthetic medium used (MS300) (see Materials and Methods) did not contain p-aminobenzoate. We therefore examined how the fermentation kinetics of the hemizygous strains were altered following supplementing the medium with p-aminobenzoate. Indeed, when p-aminobenzoate was added (1 mg/l) to the fermentation medium, the hemizygous strain carrying the BY4742 ABZ1 allele recovered a high fermentation rate (Figure 5B). In contrast, supplementation with p-aminobenzoate had no effect on the reciprocal strain carrying the 59A allele. These data are consistent with the fermentation rate being modulated by a limitation in p-aminobenzoate biosynthesis due to the presence of ABZ1 allele of the laboratory strain. Since the QTL for Nass, overlapped with the QTL for Rmax, we checked whether Nass was modulated by the ABZ1 allele. An amino-acid analysis of the fermentation medium revealed that residual assimilable nitrogen was 30 mg/l with the strain carrying the ABZ1 allele from BY4742 vs. 11 mg/l with the hemizygous strain containing the 59A form. These results indicate that nitrogen assimilation is also modulated by the ABZ1 allele. Reciprocal hemizygous analysis of ABZ1 and impact of p-aminobenzoate on the fermentation profiles. A) Fermentation rate profiles of the two reciprocal hemizygous strains carrying the ABZ1 allele from BY4742 or 59A. The hemizygous strains harbor either an active ABZ1 BY allele (strain BY4742/ABZ1-59A\xe2\x88\x86, thick gray line) or the 59A allele (strain 59A/ABZ1- BY4742\xe2\x88\x86, black line with diamonds). Profiles of the strains 59A (dark-blue line), the laboratory strain S288C (thin gray line), and the hybrid Z59S (black line) are shown. B) Impact of p-aminobenzoate on the fermentation profiles of hemizygous strains. Fermentation kinetics of two hemizygous strains in MS300 supplemented or not with 1 mg/l of p-aminobenzoic acid. Hemizygous strain carrying S288c ABZ1 allele in MS300 without (black line) or supplemented with p-aminobenzoic acid (gray kinetic line). Hemizygous strain carrying 59A ABZ1 allele in MS300, without (red kinetic line) or supplemented with p-aminobenzoic acid (pink kinetic line). The supplementation with p-aminobenzoic acid improves the fermentation capacity of the hemizygous strain carrying the S288c ABZ1 allele. The genetic determinants of variation for most of the fermentation parameters in yeast are still unknown. In this study, we addressed the genetic basis of several fermentation traits and combined this with gene-expression analysis and an eQTL approach. Using a segregating population of a limited size we identified QTL for several fermentation traits. Accurate measures of kinetic parameters\xe2\x80\x94specifically fermentation rates\xe2\x80\x94allowed us to show that depending on the progress of fermentation, different QTL are associated with different fermentation rates; one for Rmax, and one for R70. This is consistent with the notion that, depending on fermentation progress, growth, or starvation, different cellular mechanisms are critical in controlling fermentation flux. On the other hand, these parameters share other components of cell metabolism, which is indicated by their high correlation and strong association with nitrogen utilization. Indeed, we found that Rmax and Nass shared a common QTL. This QTL was dissected, and we provided functional evidence that a gene involved in p-aminobenzoate synthesis plays a role in controlling Rmax and Nass. The ABZ1 allele has a strong effect on the fermentation rate and on nitrogen utilization as visualized in Figure 6. We calculated that ABZ1 could explain 51% of the variance of Rmax and 45% of the variance of Nass in the segregants population. Impact of the ABZ1 genotype on the fermentation phenotypes Rmax and Nass of the 30 segregants. A) Fermentation rate Rmax of the segregants that inherited the ABZ1 locus from S288C or 59A. B) Nitrogen assimilation (Nass) phenotype of the segregants that inherited the ABZ1 locus from S288C or 59A. The average phenotype and standard deviation are indicated for each genotype group. The association of a transcriptomic analysis of the segregants population to a classical QTL approach has provided an important value of the study. Given the small size of the population, these data did not intend to decipher the regulatory variations globally. However, they could help at elucidating fermentation QTL and offer new insights into their relationships with gene expression. An outstanding observation was the evidence of overlaps among several fermentation QTL and eQTL hotspots. Two out of the seven identified hotspots overlapped with phenotypes. The other hotspots were not associated with phenotypic QTL. However, only a very small number of phenotypes were investigated, and examination of additional phenotypes is required to address potential associations with other hotspots. Similar associations between eQTL hotspots and phenotypes have been reported in yeast (Yvert et al. 2003) and other organisms (Fu et al. 2009). They are thought to originate from sequence variations that have broad pleiotropic effects. In the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, variation of complex quantitative traits could be explained by a few hotspot genomic regions that controlled various parameters (Fu et al. 2009). In the present study, we show that the ABZ1 allele has a strong impact on the fermentation capacity of the strain. Indeed, such physiological changes are expected to be coupled to massive changes in gene expressions, which can explain the hotspot. In this case, the hotspot results from the effects of a strong metabolic alteration and not directly from modification of a general regulator. Our data show that the ABZ1 allele from S288c is unable to support an Rmax that is similar to the industrial form. Because this phenomenon is abolished by the addition of p-aminobenzoate to the fermentation medium, we can infer that a limitation in the flux of this metabolite is responsible for the lower fermentation rate. p-aminobenzoate is an intermediate of the tetrahydrofolate biosynthetic pathway, which leads to a family of cofactors required for one-carbon transfer reactions. These methyl-donor compounds are involved in the synthesis of methionine, serine, and purines (Thomas and Surdin-Kerjan 1997). A limiting flux in p-aminobenzoate can therefore trigger a limitation in the availability of one of these metabolites. Given the pivotal role of methionine in translation, this may limit the rate of protein synthesis and in turn the incorporation of nitrogen sources. This mechanism is consistent with the observed correlation between Rmax and Nass, as well as with the overlap of their QTL. Our results highlight the critical role of methyl-donor biosynthesis in the control of nitrogen utilization during alcoholic fermentation. Interestingly, we did not observe any significant effect of the ABZ1 allele on the growth rate of the hemizygous strains (data not shown). This suggests that the methyl-donor pathway is more critical for sugar flux then for cell growth. The difference in nitrogen utilization triggered by the ABZ1 alleles is also clearly responsible for the differential expression of genes regulated by nitrogen sources. This explains the correlations of the genes under NCR control, such as MEP2 and PUT1, with Rmax. Most of the genes linked to the hotspot are however not involved in nitrogen metabolism but respond to various environmental changes including nitrogen depletion (Gasch et al. 2000). This suggests that they correspond to both direct and indirect effects of the ABZ1 allele. Unexpectedly, we did not observe any deregulation of the ABZ1 gene itself; it was not differentially expressed in the parental strains and displayed no change in the segregants. A similar lack of differential expression was also noticed for genes downstream ABZ1 in the biosynthetic pathway, ABZ2 and FOL1 (data not shown). This suggests that the genes of the pathway are not or poorly regulated by the Abz1 product, 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate, or by downstream metabolites such as p-aminobenzoate. The Abz1 protein from the strain 59A contains five amino acids changes compared with the S288c form. Comparison with the Abz1sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains from various origins available at the Sanger Institute (Liti et al. 2009) or in Genbank shows that the same changes are found in other wine yeasts, such as VIN13 (Borneman et al. 2011) and RM11-1a (Ruderfer et al. 2006) (Figure S9). Three of these amino acid changes (T313R, Q650E, N777T) are found in all Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (except laboratory ones) and a fourth mutation (N475D) in all except 3 of the 39 strains sequenced at the Sanger Institute. Only the L559 was found in strains from different origins [e.g, wild (UWOPS87.2421, UWOPS05.217) or sake (Y12)]. The four common amino acids changes were also found in ABZ1 orthologous of other Saccharomyces species, indicating that they correspond to an ancestral form of the gene. This situation is consistent with a divergence of the ABZ1 gene of S288c. This evolution has been likely associated to a partial loss of function of the p-aminobenzoate synthase probably due to a cultivation of the strain in rich laboratory media (Kvitek et al. 2008). This idea is strengthened by additional information obtained from a large-scale analysis of fermentation phenotypes of Saccharomyces strains that included those from the Sanger list (Liti et al. 2009; Camarasa et al.; paper in preparation). It was observed that alteration of Rmax in the absence of PABA was associated to Abz1 amino acids that are shared by laboratory strains (Camarasa, personal communication). This is consistent with an evolution ABZ1 toward a defective form in the laboratory strains. The laboratory allele of ABZ1 is probably not heavily defective since it does not lead to a true PABA auxotrophy. The strain S288c grows normally in a minimal medium without PABA with no change observed by comparison with a medium supplemented with 1 mg/l PABA) (data not shown). Such a situation may have facilitated the conservation of an ABZ1 form that triggers a phenotype only under specific conditions. More information based on variation of fermentation parameters and their relationships with expression will certainly be gained from the dissection of the QTL corresponding to the chromosome II hotspot that controls the fermentation rate in the late phase at R70 and consistently at R50. Several genes involved in stress responses (HSP30, HSP12, SPS100) whose level of expression correlated negatively with R70 have a linkage in the hotspot. These stress genes displayed a high level of expression in the laboratory strain and in the progeny that inherited the laboratory-strain form of the region (data not shown). This indicates that the locus from S288c leads to a specific stress response and a low fermentation rate. The potential mechanisms for this observation remain unknown. Our study did not address the expression of the genes acquired by the wine strain EC1118 from a horizontal transfer (Novo et al. 2009) as these genes were unknown at the beginning of the study. However, we have checked for linkage to makers flanking these regions and did not find any with fermentation traits and only one weak with an eQTL, suggesting that they have no strong impact on the parameters considered here. The biological device used in the present study with a small population of segregants was able to detect fermentation QTL, but it had a lower power to detect eQTL. An additional difficulty for eQTL detection may originate from the specific physiological conditions under which we analyzed gene expression (i.e., nongrowing cells under conditions of stress). Until now, yeast eQTL studies have been performed with growing cells. Under starvation and conditions of stress, many genes that respond to environmental changes have an expression more noisy than average (Gasch 2007; Razer et al. 2004). However, because most critical phenomena in industrial alcoholic fermentations (reduction in carbon flux, ethanol inhibition, cell death, etc.) take place during this phase, an assessment of the relationships between variations in gene expression and fermentation traits is required under such conditions. The findings of our study are the first step toward understanding this process. We demonstrated the role of a QTL relevant for alcoholic fermentation performance and provided an initial basis to address the relationships among fermentation QTL and variations in gene expression.

Over a three year period, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), generated through a cross between lines resistant (\xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99) and susceptible (\xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99) to CLS, were field-tested for their resistance to the pathogen. Composite interval mapping (CIM) showed four QTL involved in CLS resistance to be consistently detected. Two resistant QTL (qcr1 on chromosome III, qcr4 on chromosome IX) bearing \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 derived alleles promoted resistance. Across 11 investigations, the qcr1 and qcr4 QTL explained approximately 10% and over 20%, respectively, of the variance in the resistance index. Two further QTL (qcr2 on chromosome IV, qcr3 on chromosome VI) bearing \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 derived alleles each explained about 10% of the variance. To identify the monogenic effect of the resistance, two QTL derived from \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 against the genetic background of \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99, using molecular markers. The qcr1 and qcr4 were precisely mapped as single QTL, using progenies BC5F1 and BC2F1, respectively. The qcr1 that was located near e11m36-8 had CLS disease severity indices (DSI) about 15% lower than plants homozygous for the \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 genotype. As with qcr1, heterozygosis of the qcr4 that was located near e17m47-81 reduced DSI by about 45% compared to homozygosis. These two resistant QTL might be of particular value in marker-assisted selection (MAS) programs in CLS resistance progression.Caused by the fungus Cercospora beticola Sacc., Cercospora leaf spot (CLS), one of the most serious and widespread foliar diseases of sugar beet, typically provokes necrotic lesions, leading to a rapid and progressive destruction of the plant\xe2\x80\x99s foliar apparatus (Holtschulte 2000). The continued replacement of new leaves occurs at the expense of reserve substances stored in sink tissues, and leads to a reduction in yield and sugar content. Yield losses of as much as 42 to 50% have been reported for CLS-infected beet crops (Smith and Martin 1978; Verreet et al. 1996). CLS control programs have sought to prevent disease infection by using resistant cultivars, applying fungicides, and rotating beets with non-host crops. As part of these efforts, sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) geneticists and breeders have sought to breed CLS resistance. Lewellen and Whiteney (1976) identified monogenic resistance to the C. beticola race C2-induced CLS in a sugar beet cultivar; however, this resistance proved to be unstable and the cultivar was abandoned (Koch and Jung 2000). Some wild relatives of sugar beet have shown CLS resistance; B. procumbens C. Sm. shows CLS resistance, but is sexually incompatible with B. vulgaris (Panella and Frese 2000). However, some B. vulgaris spp. maritima accessions showing strong resistance to CLS have served as a source of CLS resistance in sugar beet (Leuterbach et al. 2004). An accession of B. vulgaris spp. maritima collected in the Po River delta by Dr. Munerati was backcrossed with sugar beets, and their resultant offspring became breeding material (Coons et al. 1955). These offspring reached the United States, were propagated there, and were then redistributed to the world (Skaracis and Biancardi 2000). The resistance achieved was effective in lowering the rate of infection in sugar beet, or in delaying the infection process (Rossi et al. 1996). However, the introduction of these resistance traits to other breeding lines was difficult given that their inheritance did not follow a simple Mendelian pattern, but rather was quantitative (Saito 1966). The resultant resistance was assumed to be controlled by at least four or five genes whose effects varied depending on the severity of infection (Smith and Gaskill 1970). Broad-sense heritability and realized heritability were estimated to be 60\xe2\x80\x9370% and 25%, respectively, while variation caused by environmental factors ranged from 44 to 62% (Smith and Ruppel 1974). Due largely to environmental factors that affect the expression of resistance at the field level, mass selection for resistant phenotypes, either by natural infection or artificial inoculation, has made little progress. An apparent negative correlation between the CLS resistance and sugar yield (Saito 1966; Koch 1970) further complicated the task of these breeding programs. Genetic approach of CLS resistance, which can be aided by molecular markers, can help break the potential linkage between CLS resistance and unfavorable traits. Sch\xc3\xa4fer-Pregl et al. (1999) and Nilsson et al. (1999) conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses of CLS intensity in sugar beet lines consisting of an F2 population and F3 families. They reached a similar conclusion to Smith and Gaskill (1970), namely that at least four or five QTL were involved. Similarly, two QTL analyses conducted by Setiawan et al. (2000)\xe2\x80\x94one based on a field test under natural infection condition and another using a leaf disk test\xe2\x80\x94detected at least four QTL. While these studies were pivotal in elucidating the genetics of CLS resistance in sugar beet, questions remained as to the precise map positions of the QTL, as well as their respective gene products and effects. We launched a multitask research program on the genetic analysis of sugar beet resistance to multiple diseases, including Aphanomyces root rot, CLS and Rhizoctonia root rot. An initial field-based screening of Japanese sugar beet lines identified breeding line \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 as a source of a high level of resistance to multiple diseases (Taguchi et al. 2007). This prompted us to characterize the genetic nature of these resistance traits, with a goal of establishing a marker-assisted selection (MAS) system for resistance to these diseases. This would enable the rapid development of a sugar beet line with all known resistances within a short time. As a part of this program, we focused our analysis on the genetics of resistance to CLS. The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify QTL for CLS resistance within our breeding material under field conditions, (2) resolve the QTL into individual genetic factors using recombinant inbred lines (RILs), and (3) evaluate the genetic effect of each QTL using near isogenic lines (NILs) produced by recurrent back crosses.'","b""The complex inheritance of resistance to Cercospora leaf spot (CLS), the most severe fungal foliar disease in sugar beet, was investigated by means of quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis.

Sugar beet lines used in this study were developed by the National Agricultural and Food Research Organization (NARO) at the Hokkaido Agricultural Research Center (HARC), Japan. A resistant line \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 and a susceptible line \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 were O-type, in which all the genes for fertility restoration of Owen-type cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) were homozygous for non-restoring alleles. An F1 plant was obtained from the cross between \xe2\x99\x80 \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x99\x82 \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99, then self-pollinated to generate F2 seeds. To produce F3 lines, each of one specimen parental plant was physiologically isolated to prevent cross-pollination. 80 RILs were created in the F6 to F7 generation, alternating with a single-seed descent method after F3 lines. \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-CMS\xe2\x80\x99 was an isoplasmic line whose nuclear genotype was almost identical to \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 but which possessed Owen CMS. The five sets of NILs and BLs (BC3F3 and BC4F1-CMS) were already constructed at HARC by a recurrent backcross scheme (Taguchi et al. 2010). The segregation population of BLs (BC5F1-CMS & BC2F1-CMS) was prepared by crossing \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 to each single plant with backcrossed progeny. \xe2\x80\x98Monohomare\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Monohikari\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Yukihinode\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Stout\xe2\x80\x99 were commercial sugar beet cultivars. Field trials were carried out in HARC fields, in Memuro, Japan. For initial QTL analysis, the experiment was set up as a randomized block with four replications (2005 and 2006) or two replications (2007). Individual plot size was 1.35 m2, and the final plant density was ten plants per plot (= 70000 plants ha\xe2\x88\x921). For selection of backcross progenies, a similar design, with four replications, was used in 2008. For precise QTL mapping, (conducted in 2009), sugar beets were planted in a zigzag pattern; each subject plant was enclosed by a barrier of resistant plants, to prevent them from contacting each other (Taguchi et al. 2002). The initial plant density was 70,000 plants ha\xe2\x88\x921, and declined to roughly 3500 plants ha\xe2\x88\x921 after the removal of barrier plants, before the evaluation of CLS resistance. Individual plot size was 32.4 m2, and the final plant density was 120 plants. Seeds were sown in paper pots (19 mm diameter and 13 cm height, Nippon Beet Sugar Mfg. Co., Ltd.) in early April. One month later, seedlings were transplanted to the field. Cercospora beticola inoculum was prepared as follows: petioles of sugar beet leaves expressing severe CLS symptom were collected from HARC fields, dried, and ground to a powder. In early July of the subsequent year, inoculum (5 g) was applied at the foot of each plant. Initial symptoms were observed roughly one month after inoculation. Visual symptoms of CLS were rated on an index ranging from zero for no symptoms, to five for fully destroyed main leaves in each 10 plants per replication. Data for RILs, NILs and BLs were averaged across replications in each investigation time. Total cellular DNA was extracted from fresh leaves according to the procedure of Roger and Bendich (1988). Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) was detected using an AFLP Analysis System I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The restriction endonucleases EcoRI and MseI were used in this analysis. The adapter-ligated DNA was pre-amplified with primers having a single selective nucleotide. For selective amplification, EcoRI-NNN and MseI-NNN primers were employed using primer sets (Taguchi et al., 2009). The amplified products were electrophoresed using a High Efficiency Genome Scanning (HEGS) system (Hori et al. 2003; Kikuchi et al. 2003), in which discontinuous non-denatured polyacrylamide gel and TBE buffer were used. The gels were scanned after staining with Vistra Green I (GE Healthcare UK, Amersham Place, England) or Sybr green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) and photographed under a UV transilluminator (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS) markers were developed as follows. PCR products were generated using primer sets, as described by M\xc3\xb6hring et al. (2005), Hunger et al. (2003), and Schneider et al. (1999), then digested with one of thirteen restriction endonucleases: HaeIII, HhaI, TaqI, HapII, MboI, AfaI, XspI, AluI, and AccII (Takara Bio, Ohtsu, Japan); TspEI (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan); and MseI, HpyCH4IV, and NlaIII (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA, USA). The resultant fragments were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels to check for polymorphism. Other PCR markers including simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were based on McGrath et al. (2007), Viard et al. (2002), Laurent et al. (2007), and Hagihara et al. (2005). The cycling parameters were 40 cycles of 94\xc2\xb0C for 1 min and 50\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xb0C (depending on the primers) for 1 min, followed by one cycle at 72\xc2\xb0C for 10 min. The amplified products were electrophoresed using the HEGS system. To identify CLS resistance QTL in \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O,\xe2\x80\x99 a linkage map was constructed using the 80 RILs, using DNA markers such as AFLP, CAPS, and SSRs. Seventy-nine selected AFLP markers, whose map positions had been examined using an F2 population derived from a cross between \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 (Taguchi et al. 2009), were deemed to effectively cover the nine linkage groups of sugar beet. For CAPS markers, PCR primers were prepared based on SNP marker sets (M\xc3\xb6hring et al. 2005) and STS from resistant gene analogs (RGAs) (Hunger et al. 2003). A total of 1287 combinations (99 primer sets and 13 restriction endonucleases) were tested in an effort to detect polymorphism between the parental lines. Of 78 primer combinations, 10 were polymorphic between the parental lines. MP-A16 was a PCR marker which co-segregated with X, a nuclear fertility restorer for Owen CMS (Hagihara et al. 2005). Polymorphic bands among the RILs were checked by their coupling to \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99, as well as segregation. The multiple segregation data were manually scored using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Segregation data of AFLP, SSR, and CAPS markers were grouped at a logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold of 3.0 and a maximum distance of 25 cM. Marker order in each of the linkage groups was verified by using MAPMAKER/EXP version 3.0 (Lander et al. 1987). The Kosambi mapping function was used to calculate the map distance (Kosambi 1944). QTL analysis was carried out by one of two methods: (1) composite interval mapping (CIM) using Win QTL Cartographer version 2.5 (Wang et al. 2007) using a permutation test with 1000 permutations and a mean LOD threshold sufficient to declare a putative QTL as being significant or not, or (2) simple interval mapping (SIM) methods with MAPMAKER/QTL1.1 (Lincoln et al. 1993). To genetically characterize the CLS resistance possessed by \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 and progeny generated. Based on plant symptoms expressed after infection promoted by inoculums, CLS resistance was assessed in field trials. \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 scored the lowest or second lowest disease severity index (DSI) in every year (Table 1), indicating its strong resistance to CLS. On the other hand, 'NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 scored the highest or the second highest DSI, and was considered highly susceptible. An ANOVA between parental lines indicated that \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 was significantly more resistant to CLS than \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 (Table 1). In 2006 and 2007, the field trials included three commercial sugar beet varieties, \xe2\x80\x98Monohomare\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Monohikari\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Yukihinode,\xe2\x80\x99 whose CLS resistance was known to be medium-weak, medium, and strong, respectively (Taguchi et al. 2007). In both years, their DSIs consistently followed the order of their CLS resistances (Table 1), thus validating the field trials. The DSIs in 2007 were higher than those in 2005, but comparable to those of 2006. The DSI of F1 plants derived from the \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 \xc3\x97 \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 cross were close to the mean of their parent values. Therefore, the CLS resistance appeared to behave in an additive manner. We developed 80 RILs from a single F1 plant. Their resistance to CLS was examined in the field trials (2005, 2006 and 2007). Table 2 shows the frequency distribution of DSIs among the 80 RILs. Year-to-year correlations of medium to late season DSI assessments showed R2 values of 0.59, 0.69, and 0.55 for 2005/2006, 2006/2007, 2005/2007 comparisons, respectively. These figures indicate that the CLS resistance was expressed in a stable manner over the three years. Altogether, the resultant map covered 867cM, including the 79 AFLP, 25 CAPS, 10 SSR, and 1 PCR markers, with a mean distance between loci of 7.5 cM (Figure 1), among which nine linkage groups were apparent. The assignment of the nine linkage groups to the nine sugar beet chromosomes (Butterfass 1964; Schondelmaier and Jung 1997) was succeeded by anchoring the CAPS markers and the MP-A16. The order of some of the AFLP markers was slightly different from the previous linkage map described by Taguchi et al. (2009), but the grouping of the markers was not changed.

Markers labeled \xe2\x80\x9ce**m**-**\xe2\x80\x9d were AFLP markers, while markers labeled \xe2\x80\x9c****/****\xe2\x80\x9d were CAPS markers. Marker intervals are indicated in cM. The total map length is 867 cM. Eleven sets of the 80 RILs DSI (Table 2) were analyzed by a CIM method in order to identify the relevant QTL (Table 3). In each of the data sets, two to five significant LOD peaks were detected on chromosomes II, III, IV, VI, and IX. The LOD peaks on chromosomes III, IV, VI, and IX were detected from more than eight data sets. Moreover, the location of the LOD peaks was largely consistent, indicating the presence of QTL for CLS resistance. The QTL on chromosomes III, IV, VI, and IX were named qcr1, qcr2, qcr3, and qcr4, respectively (supporting information, Figure S1). The actions of the four QTL were contrasting: qcr1 and qcr4 decreased DSI when plants had \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 alleles, and their effects were additive: \xe2\x88\x920.12 to \xe2\x88\x920.45 for qcr1 and \xe2\x88\x920.17 to \xe2\x88\x920.64 for qcr4. The CLS resistance conferred by qcr4 was always greater than that derived from qcr1 (Table 3). QTL qcr2 and the qcr3 were also additive, but increased DSI in plants bearing \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 alleles. The additive effects of the qcr2 and the qcr3 were estimated to be 0.11 to 0.57, and 0.14 to 0.44, respectively. The \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 genotypes with respect to the marker mp0117/HaeIII around qcr2 had DSI that was an average of 14% higher than the \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 genotype in RILs. Around the qcr3 BvATT6, it had DSI that was an average of 18% higher than the \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 genotypes. In examining the phenotype of plants having either of the two resistant QTL, qcr1 and qcr4, qcr1, it was discovered to be located near Acr1, a resistance gene for Aphanomyces root rot whose source was \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 (Taguchi et al. 2010). The hypothesis that map positions of qcr1 and Acr1 being so close meant that plants selected for Acr1 were also CLS resistant due to the linked qcr1 was tested. Five near isogenic lines (NILs; BC3F3) and five back-crossed lines (BLs; BC4F1) selected for a probable chromosomal region containing the Acr1 QTL but having an otherwise \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 nuclear background (Taguchi et al. 2010) were planted to examine CLS resistance. With a mean DSI (Sept. 10) of 2.4, \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 plants exhibited a lower DSI than the strong resistant variety \xe2\x80\x98Stout\xe2\x80\x99 on (Table 4). Under the same conditions, \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 plants were severely damaged (mean DSI of 4.6). The DSIs of the five NILs and the five BLs-CMS lines ranged from 3.5 to 4.8, of which NIL-2, NIL-3, BL-CMS-2, and BL-CMS-3 were the most resistant (Table 4). One of the two resistant backcross lines, BL-CMS-2, which was absent from tk/XspI to e10m37-9 (Taguchi et al. 2010), was selected and crossed with \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 to generate a population segregating the CLS resistance likely governed by the qcr1. In 2009, QTL analysis of CLS resistance in this population (BC5F1) was conducted using a SIM method. The LOD score and the estimated additive effect assessed through the SIM method are presented in Table 5. The qcr1 was located near the PCR marker e11m36-8, on chromosome III (Figure 2A). The explained variance was roughly 45% (Table 5). Plants heterozygous with respect to genotype marker around qcr1 had Cercospora leaf spot disease severity indices (DSI) about 15% lower than plants homozygous for the \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 genotype. To assess the effect of qcr4, graphical genotypes of the 80 RILs derived from 115 molecular markers were used to select lines bearing the qcr4 but not the qcr1 QTL. Line \xe2\x80\x98RIL 56\xe2\x80\x99 was selected as meeting this criterion, and was crossed with \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-CMS.\xe2\x80\x99 The resultant B1F1 was back-crossed with \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99, to generate two BC2F1-CMS populations each segregating the qcr4. In 2009, plants of the population were planted for QTL analysis of CLS resistance by the SIM method. The qcr4 was located near the PCR marker e17m47-81, on chromosome IX (Figure 2B). The explained variance was roughly 46%. Plants heterozygous with respect to genotype marker around qcr1 had Cercospora leaf spot disease severity indices (DSI) about 45% lower than plants homozygous for the \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 (Table 5).

Genetic analysis of CLS resistance in sugar beet, carried out in a number of previous studies, revealed the quantitatively inherited nature of the resistance (Smith and Ruppel 1974; Saito 1966), but the chromosomal location of the genes responsible remained obscure. This occurred because the CLS resistance introduced from wild relatives may have been constituted by multiple genes with weak effects, making it difficult to identify individual genes as Mendelian factors. To overcome this difficulty, genetic analysis of a resistant source using well-characterized genetic stocks, such as RILs and NILs, may be a solution. Consequently, in the present study we sought to identify QTL for CLS resistance from \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 under the field conditions. The four QTL identified (qcr1, qcr2, qcr3 and qcr4) affected CLS resistance differently. The qcr4 QTL was the most stable of the four, showing large LOD scores in all eleven trials, and explained over 20% of phenotypic variance in all investigations. The other three QTL were rather unstable compared to the qcr4, their LOD peaks sometimes being beneath the threshold of significance. This might be attributable to environmental factors and/or plant conditions. For example, Saito (1966) pointed out that variation in CLS resistance was influenced by leaf age. Moreover, alleles of the qcr2 and the qcr3 of \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 appeared to confer CLS susceptibility, which led us to infer that, although \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 was the highly resistant line, there might be room to improve its resistance to CLS. The qcr1 and the qcr4 were mapped to chromosomes III and IX, respectively. Various sugar beet chromosomes have been associated with QTL for CLS resistance; Sch\xc3\xa4fer-Pregl et al. (1999) detected LOD peaks on chromosomes II, III, VI, and IX in F3 families and on chromosomes IV and V in F2 data. Nilsson et al. (1999) mapped five QTL on chromosome I, II, III, and IX, of which two were on chromosome III (T. Kraft, personal communication). The QTL mapped by Setiawan et al. (2000) were on chromosomes IV, VII, VIII (two QTL), and IX in their field test, and III, IV, VII, and IX in their leaf disc test. Because their experimental conditions and genetic model differed from ours, a direct comparison of results may be inappropriate; however, it seems significant that chromosomes III and IX have always been associated with the QTL of CLS resistance. Thus, it appears possible that CLS resistance in sugar beet involves genes located on chromosomes III and IX. For MAS selection or molecular investigation of the qcr1 and qcr4 QTL, knowledge regarding their individual effects and precise map position will be useful. We genetically approached the CLS resistance to clarify the contribution of the individual qcr1 and qcr4 QTL. A similar approach was used in dissecting rice heading QTL (Yano et al. 1997; Yamamoto et al. 2000). Assuming that molecular markers are a sufficiently stringent criterion for the introduction (as is now feasible) of a candidate chromosomal region of interest into progeny for verifying the detected QTL, particular care must be taken to accurately evaluate phenotypes, as the effect of a single QTL may be small. Therefore, individual subject plants were isolated from one another by planting CLS resistant beets as barriers. This procedure was expected to prevent subjects from touching infected beets. Subsequently, it caused easier observation of the whole plant phenotype. As a result, map positions of the qcr1 and the qcr4 were confined to chromosomal segments, and could be estimated as single QTL. Explained variance figures for the qcr1 and qcr4 QTL suggested that plants having one or both QTL in the heterozygous form exhibited higher resistance than \xe2\x80\x98NK-184mm-O.\xe2\x80\x99 The map position of the qcr1 is consistent with the location of the resistance gene cluster in the sugar beet genome. A number of important sugar beet disease resistance genes have been mapped to chromosome III; CLS resistance QTL (Sch\xc3\xa4fer-Pregl et al. 1999; Setiawan et al. 2000; Nilsson et al. 1999), Rhizomania resistance genes Rz1 to Rz5 (Barzen et al. 1999; Scholten et al. 1999; Gidner et al. 2005; Grimmer et al. 2007), and Aphanomyces root rot resistance gene Acr1 (Taguchi et al. 2010). In addition, a number of resistance gene analogs (RGAs) have been cloned from sugar beet, some of which have been mapped to a gene cluster on chromosome III (Lein et al. 2007). Further study of sugar beet genomics is forthcoming to clarify the evolution of sugar beet resistance gene clusters. The chromosome III also contains another important gene, X, a restorer of fertility for Owen CMS (Owen 1945; Hagihara et al. 2005). The map position of the X is represented by a molecular marker MP-A16, a PCR marker which co-segregates with X. The close linkage of the X, qcr1, and Acr1 suggests a possible linkage drag in the breeding of \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99. This line, which originated from breeding line \xe2\x80\x98Tmm-1\xe2\x80\x99, a Japanese donor source of the monogerm trait, was conferred by the m gene on chromosome IV (Barzen et al. 1995;Schondelmaier and Jung 1997). Although it appeared to be a highly heterogeneous population, no one had recognized any disease resistance traits in \xe2\x80\x98Tmm-1\xe2\x80\x99. In the 1960s, \xe2\x80\x98Tmm-1\xe2\x80\x99 was subjected to the selection for maintainer genotypes to obtain a breeding line having both the monogerm trait and maintainer genotype. After the second-round maintainer selection, a pedigree whose Aphanomyces root rot resistance was as high as that of \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 emerged (data not shown). The maintainer selection increased the frequency of a non-restoring allele of X, known to be very rare in the sugar beet population (Bosemark 2006). Since Acr1 and qcr1 are linked to the non-restoring allele (i.e., \xe2\x80\x98NK-310mm-O\xe2\x80\x99 is a maintainer line), the maintainer selection may have resulted in an increased frequency of Acr1 and qcr1 QTL, which likely lurked as infrequent alleles in \xe2\x80\x98Tmm-1\xe2\x80\x99. Although our speculation needs to be supported by additional data and other scenarios are possible, there may be concern that maintainer selections can cause an unintentional decrease of the genetic diversity in the resistance-gene cluster on the chromosome III, which is involved in some of the major disease resistances of sugar beet.

Eight Mutator elements have been fully characterized (Mu1, Mu2 /Mu1.7, Mu3, Mu4, Mu5, Mu6/7, Mu8, MuDR), and three are defined by TIR (Mu10, Mu11 and Mu12). The genome sequencing revealed a complex family of Mu-like-elements (MULEs) in the B73 genome. In this article, we report the identification of a new Mu element, named Mu13. Mu13 showed typical Mu characteristics by having a \xe2\x88\xbc220 bp TIR, creating a 9 bp target site duplication upon insertion, yet the internal sequence is completely different from previously identified Mu elements. Mu13 is not present in the B73 genome or a Zea mays subsp. parviglumis accession, but in W22 and several inbreds that found the Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mutator line. Analysis of mutants isolated from the UniformMu mutagenic population indicated that the Mu13 element is active in transposition. Two novel insertions were found in expressed genes. To test other unknown Mu elements, we selected six new Mu elements from the B73 genome. Southern analysis indicated that most of these elements were present in the UniformMu lines. From these results, we conclude that Mu13 is a new and active Mu element that significantly contributed to the mutagenesis in the UniformMu population. The Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mutator line may harbor other unknown active Mu elements.Mutator (Mu) transposable elements are a major class of class II transposons identified in maize by Donald Robertson (1978, 1981). The two-component system, one autonomous MuDR and many nonautonomous Mu elements, was exploited for efficient mutagenesis in maize. High copies of the elements offer a high forward mutation frequency, whereas limited copies of MuDR allowed turning off the transposition by removing the element through segregation (McCarty et al. 2005). Preferential transposition into gene rich regions by Mu elements enhances mutagenesis frequency. And transposition not limited to linked loci facilitates genome wide mutagenesis. For these reasons, several mutant populations in maize were created by using the Mu system (Bensen et al. 1995; May et al. 2003; Raizada 2003; McCarty et al. 2005). The well-characterized Mu elements (Mu1 to Mu9/MuDR) were discovered exclusively in maize. Subsequent molecular analyses and genome sequencing revealed that Mu elements are present in plants (Lisch 2002), fungi (Chalvet et al. 2003), bacteria (Eisen et al. 1994), protozoans (Pritham et al. 2005), and metazoans (Hua-Van and Capy 2008). Based on sequence similarity, these elements are classified as Mu-like elements (MULEs). MULEs belong to a superfamily of transposons with complex members and diverse sequences. Typical characteristics of this family include a conserved 50\xe2\x80\x93200bp terminal inverted repeat (TIR), unrelated internal sequences between the TIRs, and creating a 9bp target site duplication (TSD). In contrast, all the previously identified Mu elements from maize (Mu1-Mu9/MuDR) carry a \xe2\x88\xbc220bp TIR that is highly conserved. Transposition activity of the elements is thought to be associated with the TIR sequences. Inactive elements carry mutated TIRs. Different from Ac/Ds and Spm/dSpm transposable elements where the non-autonomous elements are deletion derivatives of the autonomous elements, the internal sequences between TIRs among Mu elements are often unrelated. Some Mu internal sequences showed high similarity to host genome, suggesting a possible gene capture in the formation of these elements. This class of Mu elements was classified as Pack-MULEs (Jiang et al. 2004). About 262 Pack-MULEs were identified in the B73 genome (Schnable et al. 2009). Because promoters are found in the TIRs, Mu internal sequences may be transcribed in convergent orientations (Hershberger et al. 1995; Lisch 2002). Hence, it was suspected that some of the Pack-MULEs may have regulatory function, as antisense transcripts may interfere with expression of the endogenous genes (Lisch 2005; Juretic et al. 2005). Transposition of all Mu elements required the presence of an active MuDR element. The MuDR element contains two genes, mudrA encoding a transposase (MURA) and mudrB whose product (MURB) is of unknown function. MURA showed high similarity to bacterial transposase and the virus integrase (Walbot and Rudenko 2002); hence, it is essential for transposition. Transposable elements containing only mudrA-like genes were found in both monocots and eudicots (Saccaro et al. 2007). The mudrB gene is only present in the genus Zea (Lisch et al. 2001). Jittery, an autonomous transposon identified in maize, contains a mudrA-like gene, but with TIR sequences distinct from Mu elements (Xu et al. 2004). Jittery exhibited high frequency of excision, causing somatic and germinal reversion, but apparently lost its activity for new insertions. Transposition of Mu elements employs two distinct mechanisms. In somatic cells, transposition mostly uses a \xe2\x80\x9ccut-and-paste\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism. The element cuts itself and reinserts it in a new locus elsewhere in the genome. High-frequency excision of Mu elements is restricted to the late stage of cells in development during organogenesis. In germinal cells, Mu transposition uses a \xe2\x80\x9creplicate-and-insert\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism where the element replicates just before meiosis or in the gametophytes and inserts in a new locus in the genome. Consequently, \xe2\x80\x9ccut and paste\xe2\x80\x9d transposition does not increase the copy number, whereas \xe2\x80\x9cduplicate-and-insert\xe2\x80\x9d transposition does. Excision of a Mu element left a footprint of the 9bp TSD, which sometimes restored the function of the donor gene such as in bz1-mum9 (McCarty et al. 2005). Prior to the sequencing of the maize genome, eleven Mu elements were reported in maize, of which eight were characterized by full sequences, (i.e., Mu1, Mu2 /Mu1.7, Mu3, Mu4, Mu5, Mu6/7, Mu8 and MuDR) (Bennetzen et al. 1984; Taylor and Walbot 1987; Talbert et al. 1989; Fleenor et al. 1990), and three were indicated by TIRs (Dietrich et al. 2002). The sequencing of the B73 genome revealed a surprisingly complex view of the Mutator family, which accounts for approximately 1% of the 2.3 gbp genome (Schnable et al. 2009). These include MULEs, Pack-MULEs, and SOLOs that contain only one TIR. Many of these elements contain a shorter TIR, suggesting that these elements may have lost the capacity for transposition. In this study, we report a new Mu element, Mu13, which was identified from the UniformMu population, a derivative Mu active line from the Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mu line. Mu13 exhibits typical Mu characteristics and is active in transposition. It contributes significantly to mutagenesis. The finding of Mu13 adds to the active Mu reservoir and facilitates cloning of causative insertions in the Mu tagged mutants in phenotype-driven forward genetics in maize.'","b'Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mutator (Mu) system has been used in large scale mutagenesis in maize, exploiting its high mutation frequency, controllability, preferential insertion in genes, and independence of donor location.

From these results, we conclude that Mu13 is a new and active Mu element that significantly contributed to the mutagenesis in the UniformMu population. The Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mutator line may harbor other unknown active Mu elements. Mutator (Mu) transposable elements are a major class of class II transposons identified in maize by Donald Robertson (1978, 1981). The two-component system, one autonomous MuDR and many nonautonomous Mu elements, was exploited for efficient mutagenesis in maize. High copies of the elements offer a high forward mutation frequency, whereas limited copies of MuDR allowed turning off the transposition by removing the element through segregation (McCarty et al. 2005). Preferential transposition into gene rich regions by Mu elements enhances mutagenesis frequency. And transposition not limited to linked loci facilitates genome wide mutagenesis. For these reasons, several mutant populations in maize were created by using the Mu system (Bensen et al. 1995; May et al. 2003; Raizada 2003; McCarty et al. 2005). The well-characterized Mu elements (Mu1 to Mu9/MuDR) were discovered exclusively in maize. Subsequent molecular analyses and genome sequencing revealed that Mu elements are present in plants (Lisch 2002), fungi (Chalvet et al. 2003), bacteria (Eisen et al. 1994), protozoans (Pritham et al. 2005), and metazoans (Hua-Van and Capy 2008). Based on sequence similarity, these elements are classified as Mu-like elements (MULEs). MULEs belong to a superfamily of transposons with complex members and diverse sequences. Typical characteristics of this family include a conserved 50\xe2\x80\x93200bp terminal inverted repeat (TIR), unrelated internal sequences between the TIRs, and creating a 9bp target site duplication (TSD). In contrast, all the previously identified Mu elements from maize (Mu1-Mu9/MuDR) carry a \xe2\x88\xbc220bp TIR that is highly conserved. Transposition activity of the elements is thought to be associated with the TIR sequences. Inactive elements carry mutated TIRs. Different from Ac/Ds and Spm/dSpm transposable elements where the non-autonomous elements are deletion derivatives of the autonomous elements, the internal sequences between TIRs among Mu elements are often unrelated. Some Mu internal sequences showed high similarity to host genome, suggesting a possible gene capture in the formation of these elements. This class of Mu elements was classified as Pack-MULEs (Jiang et al. 2004). About 262 Pack-MULEs were identified in the B73 genome (Schnable et al. 2009). Because promoters are found in the TIRs, Mu internal sequences may be transcribed in convergent orientations (Hershberger et al. 1995; Lisch 2002). Hence, it was suspected that some of the Pack-MULEs may have regulatory function, as antisense transcripts may interfere with expression of the endogenous genes (Lisch 2005; Juretic et al. 2005). Transposition of all Mu elements required the presence of an active MuDR element. The MuDR element contains two genes, mudrA encoding a transposase (MURA) and mudrB whose product (MURB) is of unknown function. MURA showed high similarity to bacterial transposase and the virus integrase (Walbot and Rudenko 2002); hence, it is essential for transposition. Transposable elements containing only mudrA-like genes were found in both monocots and eudicots (Saccaro et al. 2007). The mudrB gene is only present in the genus Zea (Lisch et al. 2001). Jittery, an autonomous transposon identified in maize, contains a mudrA-like gene, but with TIR sequences distinct from Mu elements (Xu et al. 2004). Jittery exhibited high frequency of excision, causing somatic and germinal reversion, but apparently lost its activity for new insertions. Transposition of Mu elements employs two distinct mechanisms. In somatic cells, transposition mostly uses a \xe2\x80\x9ccut-and-paste\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism. The element cuts itself and reinserts it in a new locus elsewhere in the genome. High-frequency excision of Mu elements is restricted to the late stage of cells in development during organogenesis. In germinal cells, Mu transposition uses a \xe2\x80\x9creplicate-and-insert\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism where the element replicates just before meiosis or in the gametophytes and inserts in a new locus in the genome. Consequently, \xe2\x80\x9ccut and paste\xe2\x80\x9d transposition does not increase the copy number, whereas \xe2\x80\x9cduplicate-and-insert\xe2\x80\x9d transposition does. Excision of a Mu element left a footprint of the 9bp TSD, which sometimes restored the function of the donor gene such as in bz1-mum9 (McCarty et al. 2005). Prior to the sequencing of the maize genome, eleven Mu elements were reported in maize, of which eight were characterized by full sequences, (i.e., Mu1, Mu2 /Mu1.7, Mu3, Mu4, Mu5, Mu6/7, Mu8 and MuDR) (Bennetzen et al. 1984; Taylor and Walbot 1987; Talbert et al. 1989; Fleenor et al. 1990), and three were indicated by TIRs (Dietrich et al. 2002). The sequencing of the B73 genome revealed a surprisingly complex view of the Mutator family, which accounts for approximately 1% of the 2.3 gbp genome (Schnable et al. 2009). These include MULEs, Pack-MULEs, and SOLOs that contain only one TIR. Many of these elements contain a shorter TIR, suggesting that these elements may have lost the capacity for transposition. In this study, we report a new Mu element, Mu13, which was identified from the UniformMu population, a derivative Mu active line from the Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mu line. Mu13 exhibits typical Mu characteristics and is active in transposition. It contributes significantly to mutagenesis. The finding of Mu13 adds to the active Mu reservoir and facilitates cloning of causative insertions in the Mu tagged mutants in phenotype-driven forward genetics in maize. The maize lines used in this study were derived from the UniformMu population, a Mutator line with the mutable bz1-mum9 anthocyanin biosynthetic gene introgressed into the W22 genetic background (McCarty et al. 2005). The teosinte lines Zea mays subsp. parviglumis (Accession: PI 384061) and Zea mays subsp. mexicana (Accession: PI 566684) were provided by the Maize Genetic Stock Center. Other inbred lines (W22, B73, Mo17, M14, Q66, Q67, B77, and B79) were generously provided by Donald R. McCarty (University of Florida). The Mu13 transposable element was amplified by a pair of primers (5\xe2\x80\xb2-CTGCTCCTGTGCTATCCTCC-3\xe2\x80\xb2 and 5\xe2\x80\xb2-ACCAAACCAACAAGAGCCTG-3\xe2\x80\xb2) flanking a Mu13 insertion in a gene coding for a putative plastid Sigma factor3 (ZmSig3). Template DNA was isolated from line 03S-4081-01, homozygous for the insertion. As Mu elements carry a long terminal inverted repeat (\xe2\x88\xbc220bp), it interferes with PCR amplification. We tested different conditions with DNA polymerases of various sources. ExTaq (TaKaRa, Japan) and ThermalAce DNA polymerases (Invitrogen, USA) yielded successful amplification. The PCR reaction was composed of 20mm Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 2mm MgCl2, 200 \xce\xbcm of each dNTP, 100 nM each primer, 5% DMSO, and 1 U of DNA polymerase. PCR conditions were 96\xc2\xb0C/3min for initial denaturation, 8 cycles (95\xc2\xb0C/30 sec, 62\xc2\xb0C/30 sec, 72\xc2\xb0C/2min) followed by 30 cycles (95\xc2\xb0C/30 sec, 58\xc2\xb0C/30sec, 72\xc2\xb0C/2min), with final extension at 72\xc2\xb0/10min. The PCR fragment was purified from gel by gel extraction kit (Zymo Research, USA), ligated into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen, USA), and sequenced. A conserved 200bp Mu TIR sequence based on known Mu elements (Mu1 to Mu9/ MuDR) was used in a BLAST search of the GenBank maize sequences, with a cut-off E value of < e\xe2\x88\x9210. Within this collection, the known Mu elements were identified by a BLAST search with the internal sequence of each Mu element. Identical sequences were clustered using BLASTCLUST (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast). The resulting collection was analyzed for left- and right-TIR in terms of orientation and homology, as well as the presence/absence of a 9bp host sequence direct duplication. We amplified the internal sequences of six new Mu elements that carry highly conserved TIR at both ends. The primers were listed in Table I, and the PCR conditions were similar to those present in the amplification of Mu13. The internal sequences were cloned in pCR4-TOPO and sequenced. UniformMu mutants segregating for visible mutant phenotype of embryo defective (emb), small kernel (smk), empty pericarp (emp), shrunken (sh), and defective kernel (dek) were randomly chosen. The 18 mutants were 06S-6001 (smk), 06S-6002 (emp); 06S-6004 (defective kernel, dek); 06S-6005 (emp); 06S-6016 (smk); 06S-6018 (dek); 06S-6019 (smk); 06S-6020 (emb); 06S-6023 (emp); 06S-6026 (smk/dek); 06S-6029 (smk); 06S-6032 (smk); 06S-6033 (emb); 06S-6034 (dek); 06S-6044 (dek); 06S-6045 (emp); and 06S-6055 (sh/smk). Each DNA was extracted from seedlings of three individual ears that were genotyped based on the seed phenotype. All these ears did not exhibit active MuDR activity, as indicated by the mutable bz1-mum9 anthocyanin biosynthetic marker. All these lines were back-crossed with W22 twice. Genomic DNA was isolated by a urea\xe2\x80\x93phenol\xe2\x80\x93chloroform-based method. 1g fresh weight of leaf tissues was ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted with 5 ml of DNA extraction buffer (7 M urea, 0.3 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 24 mM EDTA, and 1% sarkosine, pH 8.0). After mixing with 4 ml phenol\xe2\x80\x93chloroform\xe2\x80\x93isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), the extraction was carried out with gentle shaking for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was separated by centrifugation at 4800 \xc3\x97 g for 15 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and mixed with 0.1 volume of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 3.8 ml isopropanol. DNA was pelleted at 4800 \xc3\x97 g for 5 min, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8). Approximately 10 \xc2\xb5g genomic DNA was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes at 37\xc2\xb0C for 6 hr. The DNA was resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel, denatured, and blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was cross-linked and hybridized. The probe was labeled with Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads and purified with ProbeQuant G-50 micro column (GE Healthcare). The probes used for Southern analyses for Mu14\xe2\x80\x93Mu19 were amplified from the B73 genome by PCR with primers listed in Table 1. The primer anchor positions with respect to TIR and probe sequences are listed in supporting information, File S1. For Mu13, it was derived from UniformMu by PCR with a single primer (5\xe2\x80\xb2-ATCAATGTCCTGTCACCGTTTACCGT-3\xe2\x80\xb2) that was anchored in the TIR region. Sequence alignments were carried out using the CLUSTALW algorithm available online (http://workbench.sdsc.edu/). For phylogenetic tree construction, the phylogenetic tree files from CLUSTALW analysis were imported into a TreeView program (http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html). In a large scale extraction of Mu flanking sequences from mutants isolated from the UniformMu population (McCarty et al. 2005), a Mu element was found inserted in a gene coding for a putative plastid Sigma factor 3 (ZmSig3). The element was inserted in the third exon of the gene (refer to Figure 4, Accession no. CG893004). We cloned the Mu element and found that the element is 1494bp long, containing a 223bp TIR with an 88% identity to the consensus of previously known Mu TIRs (Figure 1). The left and right TIR showed a higher identity (92%), which is a general feature of the Mu elements. A 9bp direct target site duplication was found at the insertion site. The internal sequence of this element is completely different from any previously identified Mu elements (Bennetzen 1984; Taylor & Walbot 1987; Chen et al. 1987; Talbert et al. 1989; Fleenor et al. 1990; Hershberger et al. 1991). Searching the GenBank and the nearly completed B73 genome did not find the presence of this element. In light of the partially characterized Mu elements, Mu10, Mu11, and Mu12 (Dietrich et al. 2002), we designated this element as Mu13 (Accession: HQ698272). Sequence characteristics of Mu13 element. (A) Sequences of Mu13. Terminal-inverted repeat (TIR) region is underlined. Bold sequences indicated two open reading frames and conceptual translation. (B) Structure and restriction map of Mu13. (C) Alignment of Mu13 left and right TIR. (D) Alignment of two ORFs of Mu13 element with three WD40 proteins, maize ZmWD40 (ACG25371), sorghum SbWD40 (Sb01g008680), and rice OsWD40 (Os03g0738700). Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the Mu13 internal sequences contain two open reading frames (ORF). The conceptually translated protein sequences of these two ORFs showed high similarity to a maize protein that was annotated as nucleotide binding protein (accession: ACG25371, GRMZM2G317614). Further analysis revealed that it encodes a WD40 protein, containing seven WD repeats. As indicated in Figure 1D, the first highly similar ORF started from the first methionine and covered 73 amino acid (aa) residues in length. This region shared an 88% identity with the maize WD40 protein, and a similar identity with apparent orthologs in sorghum (Sb01g008680) and rice (Os03g0738700, also identified as Os03g52870, annotated as transducin family protein). The second highly similar region (95% identity) was about 42 aa long and coincided with the first repeat of the WD40 protein. In the maize WD40 protein, these two regions were separated by 26 amino acid residues, which were not found in the Mu13. This maize WD40 gene was expressed as indicated by ESTs, suggesting that it may be a functional gene. Another WD40 gene on maize chromosome 5 (GRMZM5G852097) is apparently a syntentic paralogous duplicate of GRMZM2G317614, which is also probably functional. The insertion of Mu13 in a functional gene in the UniformMu population suggested that it was active in transposition. This insertion was not present in the parental lines that gave rise to the mutant. It is known that Mu elements are not equally active. Mu4, Mu5, and Mu7 were less active than the other known ones (Talbert et al. 1989), and so far most genes cloned by transposon tagging were inserted by Mu1/2, Mu3, Mu8, and MuDR. To assess the Mu13 transposition activity, we analyzed 18 UniformMu seed phenotype mutants randomly selected from a large set of available seed phenotype mutants. For each mutant, seeds showing no MuDr activity (lack of somatic transposition indicated by the bz1-mum9 marker gene) were selfed to produce an F2 mutant segregating family. The genotype of each F2 individual was scored by examining the ear. DNAs from three F2 individuals of either wild type (not segregating mutant phenotypes, N) or segregating seed mutant phenotype (S) were pooled separately and analyzed by Southern hybridization. As shown in Figure 2, hybridization with a Mu13 probe detected seven new Mu13 insertions, as indicated by the appearance of new Mu13 containing fragments. Because the Mu13 probe used in this analysis contained 80bp TIR sequences, it cross-hybridized with related Mu elements and produced weak signals. The Mu13 signals were strong. Three Mu13 containing fragments (4.5kb, 5.8kb, >12kb) showed uniform presence in all the members, suggesting that they are apparently parental. When the same blot was hybridized with a Mu1/Mu2 specific probe, comparable numbers of Mu1/Mu2 insertions were detected (Figure 2B). Some of these insertions were unique to individual lines, suggesting new transposition by Mu1/Mu2 as well. This result indicated that Mu13 is active in the UniformMu population. Detection of new transpositions of the Mu13 element in the UniformMu population. Genomic DNAs from eighteen randomly selected lines that segregate different seed mutant phenotypes were digested with EcoRI and hybridized with a Mu13 (A) and a Mu1 specific probe (B). A pooled WT (non-segregant, N) and a segregant (segregating each mutant phenotype, S) sample were used from each line (refer to Materials and Methods). Arrows indicate Mu13 insertions that were not found in the progenitors. The UniformMu mutagenic population was derived from introgressing Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mu-active line into W22 genetic background (McCarty et al. 2005). Hence, the Mu13 element can be derived from either W22 or Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mu-active line. To determine the presence of Mu13, nine inbred lines of maize were analyzed by Southern blot analysis by using the Mu13 internal sequence as a probe. Six inbred lines (W22, M14, Q66, Q67, Q77, and Q79) that founded the Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mutator population were included. To ensure a complete digestion, EcoRI was used, because it is methylation insensitive and does not cut Mu13 internally (Figure 1B). As shown in Figure 3A, Mu13 was detected in W22, Q67, Q77, and Q79, and was not detected in B73, Mo17, or A188. Mu13 was probably not present in M14 and Q66 because the hybridized bands were substantially weak in comparison to other lines. PCR analysis by using Mu13 specific primers did not detect Mu13 in B73, Mo17, A188, M14, and Q66, suggesting that the weak signal may have arisen from non-specific hybridization with the probe. W22 appeared to contain two copies of Mu13, whereas other inbred lines contained one to two copies. In B73, a \xe2\x88\xbc4.4kb fragment was weakly hybridized. This fragment is consistent with a WD40 gene (Accession no. ACG25371), which predicts a 4382 kb EcoRI fragment. The fragment contained a 258bp region that has 95% identity, and a 126bp region that has 98% identity to the Mu13 probe. It was expected to weakly hybridize with the Mu13 probe. In Mo17, the corresponding fragment is predicted to be 4302bp which was cross-hybridized as well. The Mu13 probe carried an 80bp sequence of the TIR (refer to File S1), which predictably would weakly hybridize with related Mu elements. This might explain the background and weak signals. Southern analysis of Mu13 element presence in teosinte and maize lines. (A) Genomic DNAs of selected maize inbreds were digested with EcoRI and hybridized with a Mu13 probe. The arrow indicates the 4382bp EcoRI fragment of the WD40 gene (Accession no. ACG25371). (B) Genomic DNAs from Zea mays subsp. parviglumis (Accession no. PI 384061) and Zea mays subsp. mexicana (Accession no. PI 566684) were digested with five different restriction enzymes (RV: EcoRV, H3: HindIII, KpnI, SalI, RI: EcoRI) and hybridized with a Mu13 probe. To test whether Mu13 is present in the ancestor of maize, we analyzed Zea mays subsp. parviglumis (Accession no. PI 384061) and Zea mays subsp. mexicana (Accession no. PI 566684). The former is believed to be the ancestor of maize from a single domestication process (Matsuoka et al. 2002). To reduce the chance that Mu13 may have resulted from a large fragment that escaped from Southern detection, five restriction enzymes (EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII, KpnI and SalI) that did not digest inside Mu13 were used to restrict the genomic DNA. Zea mays subsp. parviglumis did not contain any Mu13 element, as indicated by the absence of a hybridized signal (Figure 3B). A 5kb HindIII fragment was detected in Zea mays subsp. mexicana, but the signal intensity was much weaker than the Mu13 signals in W22 or Q79. Because this hybridization was carried out under the same conditions at which the inbred DNAs were hybridized (and the loading was comparable with samples such as W22 or Q79), the signal produced in Zea mays subsp. mexicana was more likely from the WD40 fragment or an unknown homologous fragment than the real Mu13 element. Although the primers were proven robust, subsequent PCR detection by Mu13-specific primers failed to amplify the Mu13 element from Zea mays subsp. mexicana, indicating that Mu13 was not present in Zea mays subsp. mexicana either. This result indicated that Mu13 is not present in the sample of two teosinte accessions tested, but as substantial genetic diversity exists among teosinte accessions, we cannot infer its absence among all teosintes. A Mu13 insertion was first identified in molecular characterization of the ZmSig3 gene (Accession no. CG893004, GRMZM5G830932). The ZmSig3 gene consists of six exons, and the Mu13 was inserted in the third exon (Figure 4B). Analysis of the progenitor lines and a population segregating zmsig3 mutants by PCR using Mu-TIR primer (TIR8) and the ZmSig3 specific primer (ZmSig3-R) indicated that this insertion was not present in WT and the progenitor lines, suggesting that it was a new transposition event. Insertion of Mu13 element into a gene coding for putative plastid sigma factor 3 (ZmSig3) and an NAC domain-containing protein (ZmNAC1). (A) PCR segregation analysis of ZmSig3 mutant segregation population carrying a Mu13 element insertion. 1\xe2\x80\x9317 were individual plants of an F2 family. The primers were TIR8-specific for Mu ends and ZmSig3-R\xe2\x80\x93specific for ZmSig3. (B) Structure of the ZmSig3 gene. Exons were designated as boxes and introns as lines. The Mu13 insertion and primer anchor sites are indicated. The Mu13 element is not drawn to scale. (C) PCR genotyping of a segregation population of the Mu13 insertion in ZmNAC1. 1\xe2\x80\x9312 were individual plants of the population. ZmNAC1-F and ZmNAC1-R are primers specific to ZmNAC1. ++, +\xe2\x88\x92, and \xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x88\x92 designated WT, heterozygote and homozygote for the insertion in ZmNAC1 gene, respectively. The red arrow indicates a fragment containing a Mu13 element. (D) Structure of the ZmNAC1 gene and primer locations. (E) Plants of #5, #8, and #10 (in C) exhibited a dwarf plant phenotype. The insertion in ZmSig3 suggested that the Mu13 element may contribute significantly to mutagenesis in the UniformMu population. In a previous study on seed mutants isolated from the UniformMu mutagenesis, Mu-flanking sequences were extracted by the Mu-TAIL method (deposited in GenBank, McCarty et al. 2005). The identity of the Mu element, however, is unknown. To search for insertions by Mu13, we chose two Mu insertions in known functional genes for analysis. Analysis of the Mu flanking sequences indicated that one Mu element was inserted in a paralog of Vp14 gene on chromosome 5S, named as Vp14b (GRMZM5G838285), and that the other was inserted in a gene coding for an NAC (NAM, ATAF1,2, CUC2) transcription factor domain containing protein, named ZmNAC1 (GRMZM2G312201). Both insertions were novel, as they were not present in the progenitors and were segregated specifically in individual lines. We cloned and sequenced the inserted Mu elements. The insertion in Vp14b was a Mu7 element (data not shown), and the one in ZmNAC1 was a Mu13 element (Figure 4D). We analyzed a population of 12 individual plants derived from a selfed heterozygote of the Mu13 insertion by using Mu TIR specific primer TIR8 and ZmNAC1 specific primers. The 12 individual plants were genotyped (Figure 4C). Plants homozygous for the Mu13 insertion showed a dwarf phenotype (#5, #8, and #10 in Figure 4E). Although the insertion was not confirmed as the cause of the dwarf phenotype, it indicated at least a linkage between this Mu13 insertion and the dwarf phenotype. The ZmNAC1 is likely a functional gene, as multiple ESTs were found in GenBank. The sequencing of the maize genome revealed a surprising view of the Mutator family, which accounts for 1% of the B73 genome (Schnable et al. 2009). We used the conserved 200bp Mu TIR sequences and performed a BLAST search of the maize genomic sequences in GenBank. A high stringency search (E value < e\xe2\x88\x9210) resulted in a low return of Mu elements. It appears that four types of Mu elements with distinct TIRs are present in the B73 genome. One class of Mu elements possesses TIRs with high similarity to known Mu elements in sequence and length (left and right TIR \xe2\x88\xbc210 bp). A second class contains a left TIR of \xe2\x88\xbc215bp and a short right TIR of \xe2\x88\xbc90bp. A third class contains both short TIRs (\xe2\x88\xbc100bp), and a fourth class is called SOLOs, which contain only one TIR. The previously known Mu elements only account for a very small fraction of this family. Mu1, Mu2, Mu8, and Mu13 do not exist in the B73 genome. B73, however, does contain truncated and apparently non-functional derivatives of the autonomous MuDR, as well as one copy of Mu3 and Mu7, two copies of Mu4 and Mu5, and four copies of Mu7 derivatives that have insertions or deletions in their internal sequences. Because of the absence of MuDR, these elements are dormant, and some may have lost their transposition activity due to accumulated mutations. To analyze the presence and possible activity of the unknown Mu elements in the UniformMu population, we identified a subset of MULEs from the B73 genome. The criteria are that the element 1) contains a highly conserved \xe2\x88\xbc220bp TIR on both ends (>85% identity to consensus Mu TIR sequence); 2) contains perfect TIR ends (GAGATA at the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and TATCTC at 3\xe2\x80\xb2); and 3) possesses perfect TSD in the insertion site, which is indicative for recent transposition. The known active Mu elements all contain these features. We chose six MULEs that showed the highest similarity to Mu TIR consensus and with unrelated internal sequences. These elements were named as Mu14 to Mu19 (Accessions no. HQ698273\xe2\x80\x93HQ698278, refer to File S1). A phylogenetic analysis performed by using the internal sequences indicated that these elements are not related, except for Mu1 and Mu2 (also known as Mu1.7), Mu5, and MuDR (Figure 5A). Sequence analysis strongly supports the notion that Mu1 is a deletion derivative of Mu2, and that Mu5 a deletion derivative of MuDR. Mu2 contains a 140bp direct repeat in the internal sequence (Figure 5B, box arrows). Its 3\xe2\x80\xb2 region (from 893 to 1330bp) showed a 91% identity to maize and rice genomic sequences, suggesting possible gene fragment capture. The conceptual translation product of this region showed high similarity (80% identity) to Os05g0128200, which was annotated as zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 33 in rice. In sequence alignment with Mu2, Mu1 lacks most of this region, but still retains a residual 41 bp of the likely captured fragment. Similarly, Mu5 contains two segments of the mudrA gene that codes for MURA transposase (Figure 5B). Mu15 showed slight similarity to Mu19, in which three short segments of the internal sequences shared some similarity, suggesting that the two elements are likely of the same origin. The divergent sequences indicated that deletion and insertion also occurred fairly long ago. It has been known that the internal sequences of Mu elements are likely captured gene fragments. The captured gene fragments were analyzed in the known Mu elements (Lisch 2002). Our analysis indicated that Mu3 and Mu4 can be classified as Pack-MULEs. A fragment from maize chromosome 6 accounted for most of the internal sequence of Mu3. Additionally, two fragments fused from maize chromosome 1 and 3 accounted for the internal sequence of Mu4. Sequence and structure of new Mu elements (Mu13\xe2\x80\x93Mu19) and previous known Mu elements. (A) Phylogenetic tree derived by CLUSTALW by using the internal sequences of each Mu elements. (B) Schematic structure of each Mu element. Arrows indicate terminal inverted repeats. Internal captured gene fragments are labeled based on similarity to host genome. Refer to text for captured gene fragments. We analyzed the internal sequences of new Mu elements identified in this work. As indicated in Figure 5B, the Mu13 element contains two regions that showed high similarity to a WD40 protein. Mu14 contains a fragment highly similar (89% identity) to a putative cucumisin-like serine protease on chromosome 1. Mu15 contains a fragment that is similar to xylem serine proteinase 1 on chromosome 1 (LOC100281759). Mu16 contains a fragment similar to a receptor protein kinase TMK precursor (95% identity, Accession no. BT054484) on chromosome 3. Mu17 contains fragments from different chromosomes. Mu18 contains a fragment of an auxin response factor 15 (ARF15) gene (Accession no. HM004530, 97% identity at nt level) and a calmodulin (LOC100286292, 98% identity at nt level). Mu19 contains a fragment of a putative xylem serine proteinase 1 (Accession no. NM_001154679). All of these elements except MuDR are between 1.4 and 2.5 kb in length. We cloned the internal sequences of these Mu elements and used them as probes to test their presence in inbred lines Mo17, W22, and six randomly selected UniformMu mutant lines. As shown in a Southern blot analysis (Figure 6), Mu14 to Mu18 elements were found in W22 and the UniformMu lines. The identical sizes of the fragments between W22 and the UniformMu lines strongly suggested that these elements were likely derived from W22. Mu19 was not found in Mo17, W22, or the UniformMu lines, but was found in B73. The analysis revealed that these elements represent part of the non-colinear genome fraction of the three inbred lines. B73, Mo17, and W22 were all variable for these six elements in terms of copy numbers and RFLP size. Mu19 was not present in either Mo17 or W22. It was also not detected in the six UniformMu lines. Some elements showed identical size among the three inbred lines, indicating likely early transposition events prior the separation of these inbreds. These Mu elements in the UniformMu population were derived from W22. Within the limited number of the UniformMu samples, new transposition events were not detected. Presence of the new Mu elements in W22, Mo17, and the UniformMu line. Genomic DNAs were digested with EcoRI and probed with the internal sequence of each Mu element (as indicated underneath). UniM-1 to 5 were randomly selected mutant lines from the UniformMu population. Fragment sizes are indicated by arrows. Mutator elements share a highly conserved \xe2\x88\xbc220 bp TIR sequence and create a 9bp TSD upon insertion (Walbot and Rudenko 2002). Different Mu elements are defined by the internal sequences between the TIRs. Mu13 has a TIR of 223bp that is highly similar to the conserved TIR sequences of known Mu elements (Figure 1), and yet the internal sequence is completely different from known Mu elements. Mu13 element was not found in the sequenced B73 genome, nor was it detected by Southern hybridization analysis (Figure 3). Of the two Mu13 insertions identified in this study, each created a 9bp TSD. Hence, we concluded that Mu13 is a new Mu element. Among the previously identified Mu elements, not all are equally active in transposition. Mu element transposition was driven by the autonomous element MuDR (Hershberger et al. 1991). Mu4 and Mu5 were found inactive (Talbert et al. 1989), which may likely be due to the absence of the MuDR element. However, in a large scale tagging of gl8 locus, 58% insertions were caused by Mu1/Mu2, 25% by MuDR, 7% by Mu11, and the remaining elements (Mu8, Mu12, Mu4 and Mu10) collectively merely contributed to 10% (Dietrich et al. 2002). Our analysis of the known Mu element transposition events in the UniformMu population showed somewhat different presentation. Mu1 showed higher frequency of transposition, followed by Mu3, Mu8, and MuDR (B. C. Tan and D. R. McCarty, unpublished data).

at Mu13 is active by analyzing new transposition events in a random selection of the UniformMu mutant lines, as well as by identification of Mu13 insertions in two functional genes. After the initial identification of Mu13, we recovered another Mu13 insertion in one of two insertions analyzed. These results indicated that Mu13 is highly active in transposition in the UniformMu population. Conceivably, if Mu13 is present in other Mu active lines, it should contribute significantly to mutagenesis as well. All the Mu active lines were derived from a single line from which Mu transposable elements were discovered (Chandler and Hardeman 1992). The UniformMu population was derived by introgressing Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mu active line into inbred W22. Robertson maintained the Mu activity by out-crossing with W23; thereby Mu13 could have been derived from W23. However, our Southern blot analysis as well as PCR detection confirmed the presence of Mu13 in W22. Comparison of the fragment sizes of Mu13 inserted elements between W22 and the UniformMu lines indicated that they are identical. Unless W23 contained the similar Mu13 insertions, the Mu13 elements in the UniformMu population appeared to be derived from W22. Hence, it is possible that the introgression of MuDR elements from the Mu active line activated the Mu13 element in the W22. It would be interesting to test the presence of the Mu13 element in other mutagenesis populations, such as the Maize-targeted mutagenesis population (May et al. 2003) and the Pioneer Hi-Bred International\xe2\x80\x99s Trait Utility System in Corn collection (Bensen et al. 1995). The identification of active Mu13 in the maize genome suggested that there are many more unknown Mu elements in the genome. The sequencing of the B73 genome recovered many of these elements (Schnable et al. 2009), but evidence suggested that there are more. We have analyzed six Mu elements identified in B73, and Mu19 was not detected in the UniformMu population, which is largely W22 introgressed with the Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s active Mu line. Mu13 was not found in the B73 genome, and in the tagging of 80 alleles of gl8, Mu13 was not detected in the population that derived from the Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mu-active line. Mu13 apparently was present in W22 and was activated during introgressing with Mu-active lines. The W22 line did not contain any active MuDR element (B. C. Tan and D. R. McCarty, unpublished data), hence Mu13 was inactive. Because different maize inbred lines harbor different spectrums of Mu elements, more unknown Mu elements are expected. It is highly likely that most of the maize inbred lines did not contain any active MuDR elements, hence all the MuDR driven Mu elements are dormant. Upon introducing the MuDR element, Mu element activity may be restored. If this is the case, Southern blot based cosegregation analysis using known Mu internal sequences as probes may encounter some problems. But this will not affect analysis based on the TIR sequences such as AIMS (Frey et al. 1998), Mu-TAIL PCR (Settles et al. 2004), AIMS and Mu-TAIL-PCR combined (Yi et al. 2009), and the use of PCR-coupled with pyrosequencing (Williams-Carrier et al. 2010). In addition, if the creation of new Mu elements is associated with the MuDR activity, it will be expected that there will be many new Mu elements in Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s Mu-active line. It will be interesting to know the Mu landscape in the Robertson Mu active line. The authors wish to thank the Maize Genetics Cooperative Stock Center for providing genetic materials, Donald R.

In recent years, reverse genetics has been used to identify the functions of genes, via the intentional introduction of variation and subsequent evaluation in physiological, molecular, and even population contexts. These approaches are complementary and whole genome analysis serves as a bridge between the two. We report in this article the whole genome sequencing of eighteen classical mutant strains of Neurospora crassa and the putative identification of the mutations associated with corresponding mutant phenotypes. Although some strains carry multiple unique nonsynonymous, nonsense, or frameshift mutations, the combined power of limiting the scope of the search based on genetic markers and of using a comparative analysis among the eighteen genomes provides strong support for the association between mutation and phenotype. For ten of the mutants, the mutant phenotype is recapitulated in classical or gene deletion mutants in Neurospora or other filamentous fungi. From thirteen to 137 nonsense mutations are present in each strain and indel sizes are shown to be highly skewed in gene coding sequence. Significant additional genetic variation was found in the eighteen mutant strains, and this variability defines multiple alleles of many genes. These alleles may be useful in further genetic and molecular analysis of known and yet-to-be-discovered functions and they invite new interpretations of molecular and genetic interactions in classical mutant strains.Neurospora crassa has been used as a genetic model system since the early 1930s (Lindegren et al. 1939) because it presented significant advantages for genetics research. It grows on chemically defined culture medium, has a haploid vegetative stage, can complete a full sexual generation in under a month, and produces ordered ascospores (the haploid products of meiosis), facilitating genetic analysis (Davis and Perkins 2002). Neurospora was quickly adopted by a number of laboratories and is famous for the demonstration of the \xe2\x80\x9cone-gene, one-enzyme hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d (Beadle and Tatum 1941), which showed that classical mutations that could be followed in a genetic cross were associated with biochemical traits that could be characterized chemically. By the time the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC) was established in 1960 it was estimated that hundreds of genetic loci were being investigated. The classical genetic map of N. crassa now comprises over 1,000 phenotypic markers and an additional several hundred genetic markers such as telomeres, centromeres, the nucleolus organizer, and a variety of translocations, inversions and duplications (Perkins et al. 2001). Because of its many advantages and the relative ease with which one could produce biochemical mutants, N. crassa was used for research into every aspect of genetics and biochemistry. N. crassa grows as a haploid filament that makes copious asexual spores in vegetative culture, and when compatible strains are paired, it can make either vegetative hetero-dikaryons or go into the sexual cycle. To facilitate allelism tests, strains that were vegetatively compatible and displayed high fertility were generated at Yale and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where Neurospora was utilized in extensive radiation biology studies (De Serres and Webber 1997). By 1963, much of the research community had adopted this so-called \xe2\x80\x9cOak Ridge\xe2\x80\x9d lineage. Therefore, many mutants in the FGSC collection have a shared lineage (e.g., Perkins et al. 1962). This lineage gave rise to the current wild type strains used in both the Neurospora genome sequencing project (Galagan et al. 2003) and in the Neurospora functional genomics program (Colot et al. 2006; Dunlap et al. 2007). Additionally, a compendium of Neurospora genes, first published in 1982 (Perkins et al. 1982) and updated in 2001 (Perkins et al. 2001), is currently maintained as an electronic compendium online (http://bmbpcu36.leeds.ac.uk/~gen6ar/newgenelist/genes/gene_list.htm). Despite detailed genetic, physiological and biochemical characterization, many classical mutants remain anonymous at the level of the genome sequence. However, because of the extensive genetic mapping done with N. crassa, most classical markers are flanked by genes that have been identified to the level of DNA sequence. This makes it possible to exclude most of the genome from consideration when looking to associate a genetic marker with the open reading frame (ORF) responsible for the mutant phenotype in any given strain. Whether the approach is chromosome walking with cosmids that are mapped onto the genome sequence, or by gene sequencing, the high resolution N. crassa genetic map allows one to use flanking markers to delimit the search. This approach has been used at the FGSC to identify four temperature sensitive lethal mutations by gene complementation (Dieterle et al. 2010; McCluskey et al. 2007). Advances in genome sequencing technology (Hobert 2010) have made it possible to sequence the entire genome to identify individual mutations (Le Crom et al. 2009; Pomraning et al. 2011; Sarin et al. 2010; Smith et al. 2008). For Neurospora, this is complicated by the fact that not all classical genetic mutations have been crossed into the same genetic background as that of the reference genome strain. Eight of the strains sequenced in the current report were explicitly backcrossed into the reference genome prior to deposit into the FGSC collection. Ten were reported to have \xe2\x80\x98mixed\xe2\x80\x99 backgrounds. Neurospora is a cosmopolitan fungus and it has been isolated from locations all over the world (Turner et al. 2001). While most genetic research is carried out with N. crassa, other species are commonly isolated from the environment and have unique characteristics. Neurospora intermedia is interfertile with both N. tetrasperma and N. crassa, and progeny can be recovered from crosses carried out in the laboratory. One such cross was carried out to allow a meiotic drive element, Sporekiller-2 (Sk-2), rarely identified in wild isolates of N. intermedia, to be studied in N. crassa (Turner and Perkins 1979). The FGSC collection holds and distributes a large number of morphological and developmental mutants. A subset of these for which the underlying nature of the gene defect remains unknown were chosen for this study (Table 1). In this article, we report the whole genome sequencing of seventeen classical mutant strains of N. crassa, and the putative identification of classical mutations in sixteen of them. An eighteenth strain that carries the Sk-2 meiotic drive element, originally identified in the related species N. intermedia and subsequently introgressed into N. crassa, was also sequenced. Overall, these mutant strains exhibit a wide range of sequence variability that is directly proportional to their being related to the reference genome strain. Much of the variation is shared among strains while other variation is strain-specific. Some regions of the genome show enrichment for unique variation suggesting that they are hot-spots for mutation. Insertions and deletions manifest a strong size bias associated with their presence in coding vs. non-coding DNA. The ability to compare among multiple strains and exclude shared variants aids in the association between neutral polymorphism and phenotypically relevant mutations.'","b""Classical forward genetics has been foundational to modern biology, and has been the paradigm for characterizing the role of genes in shaping phenotypes for decades.

Insertions and deletions manifest a strong size bias associated with their presence in coding vs. non-coding DNA. The ability to compare among multiple strains and exclude shared variants aids in the association between neutral polymorphism and phenotypically relevant mutations. Neurospora strains are described in Table 1 and are available from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center. Genomic DNA was purified from mycelia grown in Vogels liquid medium, using a simple phenol/chloroform extraction technique (Lee et al. 1988). Mycelia from mutants with limited vegetative growth was produced by macerating tissue in a glass tissue pulverizer under sterile conditions. DNA was randomly sheared into small fragments of between 200 and 300 bp in size using Covaris E210 according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The overhangs created by fragmentation were converted into blunt ends using T4 DNA polymerase and DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment. Using dATP, base 'A' is added to the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the blunt phosphorylated DNA fragment to prepare the DNA for ligation to the adaptors. Adaptors were then ligated to the DNA fragment using DNA ligase so that they would hybridize on a flowcell. Finally, using DNA Phusion polymerase, PCR was performed to selectively enrich those DNA fragments that have adapter molecules on both ends, and to amplify the amount of DNA in the library. DNA was sequenced on Illumina genome analyzer II. Reads were aligned to the reference genome sequence (Galagan et al. 2003) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), insertions, and deletions were characterized using maq-0.7.1 (Li et al. 2008) and with BreakDancer (Chen et al. 2009). Default maq parameters were used for SNP calling and for filtering as described in the maq paper, (maq.pl SNPfilter -f cns.indelse -F cns.indelpe -d 3 -q 40 -Q 60 -w 5 -N 2), with a subsequent minimum map quality filter of 30 applied after the indel proximity filters. The minimum consensus quality (phred scaled likelihood of the consensus base being incorrectly called) and depth filters minimize the likelihood that random sequencing errors lead to false positive SNP calls. A direct estimate of false SNP identification was not determined, but is expected to increase as the divergence from the reference increases. Though this group of strains is not a freely reproducing population and the variants have not been confirmed to exist at an allele frequency to fit the definition of a polymorphism, all of the single nucleotide variants are referred to as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for simplicity. To allow comparisons between strains, each SNP or indel was assigned a unique identifier that included the contig and position. For example, a SNP would have an identifier such as \xe2\x80\x9c3_591470_C\xe2\x80\x9d indicating that it is on contig 3 at position 591,470 and that the base at that position is C. It was necessary to include the base in the SNP identifier, as multiple polymorphisms may occur at the same position. An indel would have an identifier such as \xe2\x80\x9c6_91954\xe2\x80\x9d indicating the contig and location; size information was not encoded for indels but direct comparisons among strains were directly possible because of the small number of unique indels in any region of the genome. For validation of the deletion in strain FGSC 3921, PCR was carried out with 100 ng genomic DNA using 0.5 uM primers and taq polymerase following manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. Primers for amplification of a 1.2 kb coding fragment of wild type NCU03436 were as follows: Forward- 5\xe2\x80\xb2-CGATACTCGCTTCGTCTTCC-3\xe2\x80\xb2, Reverse- 5\xe2\x80\xb2-ATCATCAAGTCCGCCACTTC-3\xe2\x80\xb2. Photographic microscopy of culture edge morphology was carried out using a glass microscope slide culture as previously described (Dieterle et al. 2010). The morphological mutant tangerine (tng) causes the production of enlarged conidia that are delimited by a membrane, but no cell wall (Springer and Yanofsky 1989). Although the sequence of strain FGSC 3921 revealed neither unique nonsynonymous or nonsense mutations, nor frame breaking indels in the region flanked by markers in the 1 Mb region delimited by flanking markers arg-5 and pyr-4 (supporting information, Figure S1), analysis of the genome sequence of FGSC 3921 using BreakDancer (Chen et al. 2009) revealed a unique 572 base deletion in this region that occurs in NCU03436 (Table 2). PCR amplification of this gene from FGSC 3921 confirmed that the deletion was correctly identified in this strain (Figure 1). NCU03436 is the Neurospora ortholog of cpp-1 (cell-shape-control protein phosphatase) in Fusarium verticillioides where studies indicate an involvement in control of cell shape and fumonisin production. The phenotype for the NCU3436 knockout strain is identical to that of strains containing the classically derived mutation in tng (Figure 1). Morphological characterization of FGSC 3921 and validation of the deletion detected by whole genome sequencing. (A) FGSC 2489 (wt). (B) FGSC 3921 (tng) showing hyperbranching, swollen hyphae and cytoplasmic bleeding at the tips. (C) FGSC 16003 (NCU03436 [stk-15] KO) showing hyperbranching and swollen hyphae. (D) Agarose gel electrophoretic analysis of PCR products from wild type or a tng genomic DNA. Strains with a mutation in fluffyoid (fld) send up aerial hyphae that only very rarely conidiate under normal growth conditions. However, when fld mutants are grown under carbon limitation conditions, conidiation occurs at 25\xc2\xb0C but not 34\xc2\xb0C (Springer and Yanofsky 1989). Strain FGSC 7022 has over 78,000 SNPs and 8907 indels (Figure S2). Among 918 indels that are unique to strain FGSC 7022, one unique deletion was identified in the region near arg-14 and to the left of his-5 that causes a frameshift mutation in the annotated ORF NCU09739. This deletion is found in all reads covering this region in this strain and is the only frameshift inducing indel in NCU09739 among 18 strains (there is one instance of a 3 base deletion in this ORF in strain FGSC 821). There are no unique nonsynonymous or nonsense SNPs in strain 7022 left of the flanking marker his-5 further supporting the conclusion that the variant in NCU09739 is responsible for the fluffyoid phenotype. NCU09739 encodes a protein predicted to be a Zn(II)2Cys6 type fungal transcription factor and is annotated as all development altered-7 (ada-7) in The Neurospora crassa e-Compendium. Deletion of NCU09739 leads to defects in conidiation, hyphae and female (but not male) fertility(Dunlap et al. 2007). Strains with mutant com make small colonies with restricted radial growth (Perkins and Ishitani 1959). Genetic mapping places the mutation associated with com between ace-2 and ad-4 on LGIII, a span of 741 kb containing only 44 ORFs on supercontig 3. Strain FGSC 106 has over 23,000 SNPs including 1,033 unique SNPs (Figure S3). There is one unique variant in FGSC 106 that occurs in the region delimited by the flanking markers and it occurs in NCU06508. This variant encodes a C629T (ccg to ctg) mutation at the DNA level and a Phenylalanine to Leucine change at amino acid residue 210 out of 1123 and this variant occurred in all 76 reads covering this position. NCU06508 is annotated as a glycosylphophatidylinositol anchor phosphoethanolamine transferase-3 (gpip-3) that is involved in production of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors between proteins and the plasma membrane. RIP mutants in this gene were found to have defects in morphology at both the colony and microscopic levels of gpip-3 (Bowman et al. 2006). These defects are very similar to those described for strains containing a mutant in compact. Multiple phenotypes associated with the mutation amyc are small colony size including, increased cell wall thickness, and non-hyphal, multipolar budding growth under restrictive conditions. Conidiation is considered \xe2\x80\x9cconditional\xe2\x80\x9d and is dependent in part on carbon source. A single unique deletion was found in strain FGSC 305 among the 166 ORFs in the 742 kb region delimited by the flanking markers (Figure S4). The G at position 3,212,445 in gene NCU02689 is deleted resulting in a frameshift mutation and this deletion is detected in all reads covering this region in this strain. There are no other indels in this ORF among all the strains sequenced and a knockout of this gene has altered sexual morphology (FGSC #11464 Mating Type: a NCU02689.2 Heterokaryon (lrg-1)) (Colot et al. 2006). Additionally, a conditionally morphological mutant in this gene was identified and was named lrg-1 (Seiler and Plamann 2003). It was subsequently shown that LRG1 is essential for hyphal tip extension and that it plays a role in regulating (through RHO1) \xce\xb21,3-glucan synthase activity. A mutation in lrg-1 was shown to increase activity of \xce\xb21,3-glucan synthase as evidenced by decreased sensitivity to caspofungin; it is possible that the increased cell wall thickness of characteristic of amyc grown under restrictive conditions (Coniordos and Turian 1973) is due to increased \xce\xb21,3-glucan synthase activity. Another morphological mutant, tiny (ti), shows temperature sensitivity and decreased colony size with increasing temperature. There are no nonsynonymous SNPs in strain 309 in the 730 kb region carrying the mutation tiny (ti) (Figure S5) and there is only one unique indel among the 163 ORFs in this region. This 8 base deletion causes a frameshift mutation in the coding sequence of NCU10497 beginning at amino acid 405 out of 750 total amino acids. This frameshift mutation introduces fourteen nonsense codons, beginning at amino acid 445. NCU10497 encodes the oligosaccharyl transferase STT3 subunit. Stt3 is an essential gene in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Similar to alleles in S. cereviseae, the tiny allele is temperature sensitive. Because stt3 is an essential component of the N-linked glycosylation pathway, it is logical to hypothesize that this causes the decrease in cell wall protein in the ti mutant. A gene deletion mutant of NCU10497 was nonviable as a homokaryon (Dunlap et al. 2007). Strain FGSC 1303 contains only one unique indel and no unique SNPs in the 1 Mb region between pyr-1 and ace-4 (Figure S6). The deletion is the only indel in the gene NCU04990 and it removes a single nucleotide in the coding sequence causing multiple nonsense codons. This deletion is found in all reads covering this region in this strain. NCU04990 is predicted to encode the ortholog of the vhs/ran1 serine threonine kinase in S. cereviseae. The deletion of this gene in yeast leads to decreased resistance to hyperosmotic stress and accumulation of glycogen. An N. crassa knock-out mutant for this ORF has reduced asexual spore formation and abnormal sexual morphology (Dunlap et al. 2007). FGSC 1363 has one unique insertion of 8 bases among the 409 ORFs in the 2 Mb region flanked by mating type and rg-1 (Figure S7). This indel occurs in NCU02762, an ORF that contains domains associated with calcium channels, and which is an ortholog of CCH1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In S. cerevisiae, CCH1 mutants have impaired ability to take up Ca2+ (Peiter et al. 2005) in response to \xce\xb1 mating factor as well as increased sensitivity to some stress conditions. A deletion of the cch1 ortholog from Fusarium graminearum leads to a growth phenotype reminiscent of smco-1 (Hallen and Trail 2008). A Neurospora gene deletion mutant of NCU02762 was only recovered as a heterokaryon suggesting that a homokaryotic deletion would be lethal. All of the SNPs in this region are either shared, or occur in ORFs that have polymorphisms in multiple strains. The mutation known as dot is in a 1.7 Mb region on LG IR that contains 415 ORFs. The only unique variant in this region in strain FGSC 1211 is the deletion of one T from NCU00896 (Figure S8), which is detected in all reads covering this sequence in FGSC 1211. As with other morphological mutants, a gene deletion mutant of this ORF was only recovered as a heterokaryon, suggesting that it may be essential for growth or sexual reproduction. This ORF encodes a phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PtdInsP) phosphatase and is the ortholog of SAC1 from S. cerevisiae. Mutations in this gene have been implicated in growth regulation in yeast, as well as in hereditary disease in humans (Manford et al. 2010). In yeast, sac1p is localized to the ER and plays an important role in actin cytoskeleton organization, cell wall synthesis, Golgi function, lipid metabolism and vacuole morphology through regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate levels (Rivas et al. 1999). The mutation doily (do) was deposited to the FGSC collection in 1972 and is characterized by colonial morphology that is sensitive to the carbon source in the culture medium. FGSC 2261 carries the only allele known of the mutation doily (do). While this strain has a relatively high number of polymorphisms (Table 3, Table 4, and Figure S9), most of the SNPs are not unique or occur in ORFs that have other polymorphisms in multiple strains. However, one unique nonsynonymous SNP (A->G at position 3,652,079) was found in the ORF designated NCU06871. This variant had the maximum possible quality score and changes a histidine to an arginine at position 1,246 of the predicted protein. NCU06871 encodes a glycoside transferase 48 family protein involved \xce\xb2-1,3 glucan synthesis. The ortholog of this gene in Aspergillus fumigatus has been shown to be essential. Similarly, strains of Fusarium solani in which RNAi has been used to decrease expression of its ortholog show defects in morphology (Beauvais et al. 2001; Ha et al. 2006). female fertile-1 (ff-1) was originally isolated as a mutant displaying a defect in female fertility. It was later shown to be allelic with a spontaneous mutant (glycerol phosphate-1; glp-1) that was characterized by its ability to efficiently conidiate and grow on glycerol as a carbon source. This mutation lies in a 675 kb region of chromosome 2 that includes 172 ORFs and that has very few polymorphisms in strain FGSC 3831 (Figure S10). In this strain, NCU01543 has a unique insertion of 1 base that introduces a frameshift mutation causing multiple stop codons, the first of which is located at position 113 out of 762. The insertion was identified in all reads covering this region in strain FGSC 3831. An orthologous gene in Magnaporthe grisea has been characterized (Li et al. 2010); the gene, LDB1, is so named because it encodes a predicted LIM-binding-domain. LIM domains are involved in protein\xe2\x80\x93protein interactions (Kadrmas and Beckerle 2004). The phenotypes associated with deletion of this gene in M. grisea are a lack of asexual and sexual spore production, easily-wettable colonies and an inability to develop appresoria. Female sterile-n (fs-n) is on LG 1 far from mat (35%; 45%) and near T(4637) al-1, a region of 80 kb containing only 18 ORFs (Figure S11). This mutation was characterized in 1974 (Mylyk and Threlkeld 1974) and the original description of this mutant suggested that there could be two closely linked lesions responsible for the lack of female fertility in strains carrying this trait. The genome sequence of strain FGSC 3246 revealed a unique insertion of one A into NCU02794 at position 9,112,074 and this insertion was detected in all reads covering this region in this strain. While there are no other indels in strain FGSC 3246 in the 80 kb region delimited by the flanking markers there are a number of SNPs in this region, although most are shared among multiple strains. Although NCU02794, known variously as ham-2 or so (Table 2), has multiple nonsynonymous SNPs in other strains, further examination of the vegetative of morphology of FGSC 3246 indicates that is has a \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d like phenotype. The protein encoded by NCU02794 contains a WW domain and is involved in hyphal fusion and was localized to septal plugs (Fleissner et al. 2005). A knockout of this ORF is female sterile and has abnormal vegetative morphology (Dunlap et al. 2007). The tyrosinaseless-1 (ty-1) mutant phenotype was initially described as female infertile, \xe2\x80\x9cvelvet\xe2\x80\x9d (short aerial hyphae) and tyrosinaseless (Horowitz et al. 1961). Further analysis showed that tyrosinase was inducible under some conditions. Strain FGSC 322 carries over 1,400 indels in the 1.5 Mb region genetically shown to carry the mutation tyrosinaseless-1 (Figure S12). Of these, 69 are in coding sequence but only three are unique to this strain. Of these three, NCU00240 exhibits frameshift inducing indels in other strains, suggesting that it is not responsible for the tyrosinaseless phenotype. NCU00403 and NCU00455 each exhibit unique frameshift inducing indels and both deletions are strongly supported in the sequence data. While gene deletion mutants are available for both, the phenotype for the gene deletion of NCU00403 was characterized by the Neurospora Program Project and exhibited \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d growth and sexual development, including pigmentation of perithecia and ascospores (Dunlap et al. 2007). Thus, the likely gene associated with the ty-1 phenotype is NCU00455, which encodes the ortholog of S. cerevisiae Ste50, a scaffold protein that connects the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade with cell cycle machinery. The MAP kinase signaling cascade regulates a significant number of processes in fungi including the regulation of tyrosinase (Park et al. 2008). There are three MAP kinase cascades in Neurospora crassa that overlap in function and are involved in many biological processes, including cell morphology, conidiation, mating, and osmotic stress response (Borkovich et al. 2004). The mutation known as mb-1 is on LG VII, and the strain carrying this mutation, FGSC 3562, has 741 indels in coding sequences of which 71 are on super contig 7 (Figure S13). Four of the 71 indels are unique to strain FGSC 3562 and three introduce frameshift mutations. Two deletions occur in NCU02251 and both are deletions of one base (at 1,076,703 and 1,076,825). However, a homokaryotic gene deletion mutant of this strain is available suggesting that this ORF is not responsible for the phenotype in FGSC 3562. The second ORF carrying a unique frameshift mutation in strain FGSC 3562 is NCU06930, a hypothetical protein with only limited orthology among filamentous ascomycetes. This same ORF has multiple nonsynonymous SNPs in strain FGSC 821. Four additional annotated ORFs have non-unique indels with NCU11995 having thirteen distinct indels in strains 3562 and 821. Although strain 3562 has no unique nonsense codons on contig 7 it has 800 nonsynonymous SNPs on contig 7 of which 13 are unique to this strain. Of these, NCU11995 has multiple nonsynonymous SNPs. This ORF encodes a C6 zinc finger domain-containing protein. Additionally, NCU06102 has two unique nonsynonymous SNPs although a homokaryotic gene deletion mutant for this ORF is available. Other ORFs containing unique nonsynonymous SNPs are in ORFs that contain other nonsynonymous SNPs in other strains. Because of the ambiguity presented by these multiple polymorphisms, it is not possible to uniquely identify one as being responsible for the male barren phenotype in strain FGSC 3562. Although there are no indels or nonsynonymous SNPs in the region carrying the male barren-2 trait in strain FGSC 3564 (Table 1 and Figure S14), there is one unique nonsense mutation in this region in strain FGSC 3564. The G to A substitution occurred in all reads covering this position and has a quality score of 111. This variant encodes a unique nonsense codon in NCU00652 that is the only unique variant in this ORF among all 18 strains. The nonsense SNP in strain FGSC 3564 occurs at amino acid 659 out of 1188. Only four other strains display any variants in this ORF and none of these SNPs are unique. The last of the male-barren strains in the current investigation is mb-3, which is on linkage group IR near al-1 and mb-2 (Table 1). There is one unique nonsense mutation in NCU00658 in strain FGSC 3566 (Figure S15) and it occurs with high confidence. The nonsense mutation occurs at amino acid 219 out of 4008. A gene deletion mutant for this ORF has normal morphology, but is male barren. tan spore (ts) is found in strain FGSC 821, which was deposited into the FGSC collection in 1961, and is described as having been a spontaneous mutation in strain 4a, the so called Emerson lineage (Nakamura and Egashira 1961). The phenotype for ts is light colored and/or immature ascoscores that do not germinate. The ts mutation was used in studies that showed that the majority of N. crassa perithecia originate from fertilization by a single male spore each. Strain FGSC 821 has the greatest nucleotide divergence relative to the reference genome (Table 3, Table 4, and Figure S16) of all the strains characterized in the present study. Nevertheless, no unique SNPs, and only one unique indel, occur in coding sequence in the 2 Mb region flanked by the markers inl and cen-V (Table 1). The unique mutation is a deletion of one base leading to frameshift in NCU01459 (Table 2) and this deletion is detected in all reads covering this region in strain FGSC 821. NCU01459 is a BZIP transcription factor whose deletion leads to ascospore inviability. The deletion of NCU01459 leads to immature tan ascospores and was noted in (Colot et al. 2006) who named the gene ascospore lethal-2 (asl-2). Analysis of FGSC 7035 genome sequence led to the identification of a unique 1bp deletion in the gene coding region of NCU03584 as well as two ORFs carrying unique nonsynonymous SNPs among the 1,033 ORFs in the region flanked by the markers ilv-1 and asn-1 (Figure S17). While the deletion in NCU03584 is the only variant in this ORF, both of the nonsynonymous SNPs occur in ORFs that have multiple nonsynonymous SNPs or frameshift causing indels in other strains. To validate the identification of NCU03584, and the identification of unique variants by whole genome sequencing, NCU03584 from FGSC 7035 was sequenced manually and the deletion was identified by this approach as well (data not shown). The deletion in NCU03584 occurs at nucleotide 114 resulting in a stop codon at nucleotide 162 in a 7271 nucleotide ORF. NCU03584 is the likely ortholog of the polyketide synthetase responsible for perithecial pigmentation in the related fungus, Sordaria macrospora (Engh et al. 2007). Eighteen genomes were sequenced to an average depth ranging from 28 to nearly 108- fold coverage (Table 5). Sixteen strains were sequenced entirely with paired-end reads producing between 27 and 90 million paired end reads resulting in an average sequence depth ranging from 29X to 108X. Two strains, FGSC 3566 and FGSC 3831 had over 20 million single-end reads in addition to over sixty-nine million paired-end reads. While strain FGSC 7035 generated over 90 million reads, many of the reads were of low quality and only 52% were mapped to the genome. Thirteen strains were sequenced with an average read length of 35 bases while five strains were sequenced with an average read length of approximately 75 bases. There were no significant differences in the ability to map these reads to the genome for either approach and each genome was compared to the over 41 million bases of the reference genome. The portion of the genome that was aligned and compared to the reference genome ranged from 99% of the reference genome size in the most conserved strain to 81% for the most diverged strain. Since multi-alleleic calls are not expected in a haploid genome, 240 coding multi-alleleic sites and 1100 non-coding multi-alleleic sites were examined to determine what might have caused these calls. Out of 240 coding sites examined, 53% were caused by indels that were too large for maq to properly align the reads, 36% were in reads that had low mapping quality scores and/or were orphan pairs, suggesting that the read could have been misaligned, 9% appeared truly homozygous, and 2% could not be explained. For non-coding sites 4% could be explained by missed indels, 93% were in reads that had low mapping quality scores and/or were orphan pairs, suggesting that the read could have been misaligned, and 3% appeared truly homozygous. Preprocessed data from this project are available via GenBank (Table 1), or at http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Neucr1/Neucr1.home.html and tables with the processed data are available as supplemental data. Because most of the target mutations were flanked by genetic markers that are already identified to the level of the gene sequence, the amount of the genome that require examination for each strain ranged from a low of 74 kilobases (kb) in strain FGSC 305 to over 4 megabases (Mb) in strain FGSC 3562 (Table 1). The average was just over 1.7 Mb, although for seven strains the amount of genome space that needed to be searched was less than 1 Mb. The number of annotated open reading frames provides another measure of the amount of genome space that must be searched to identify the mutation responsible for the relevant phenotype. For the strains in the current project this number ranged from a low of 18 ORFs in the 80 kb between flanking markers in strain FGSC 3246 to 1,433 ORFs in the 5.8 Mb to the right of cen-1 in strain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FGSC 3566 (Table 1). In the 18 genomes, there are 1,184,610 identified single nucleotide variants (Table 4). Of these,1,137,606 (96.03%) map to contigs 1-7 (Table 6). Among these, there are 527,620 distinct positions with identified variants in all 18 strains. 244,043 of these variants occur only in one strain. 96 variants are identified as occurring in all 18 genomes, suggesting that the actual polymorphism belongs to the reference genome (Table 7). The distribution of variants among the eighteen strains varies from a high of over 188,346 to a low of 13,274 (Table 3), while the number of unique SNPs ranged from a high of 73,336 to a low of 704 (Figure 2 and Table 8). Overall, there were nearly three times more transition mutations than transversions (Table S1 in File S1). The distribution of SNPs in the 100 kb region directly flanking each mutation was calculated, separating shared and unique SNPs, and there was no apparent association between either whether the mutation was spontaneous or induced, or which mutagen was employed (Table S2 in File S1), suggesting that strain lineage and back-crossing are more important than the mutagen in influencing variant distribution. Remarkably, there are only 413 ORFs, out of nearly 10,0, that have no polymorphisms among the 18 strains (Table S3 in File S1). Among these are 274 conserved hypothetical proteins, hypothetical, or predicted proteins, but also several ribosomal protein genes, histone genes, a mating type gene, and the frequency gene that is central to the cell's circadian rhythm. Unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18 strains of Neurospora crassa. The number of unique SNPs (Table 8) was plotted for each strain and strains were sorted based on the number of unique SNPs. For this analysis, SNPs that occurred more than once in the dataset were not included. There are 62,952 distinct indels (compared to the reference genome) present in the 18 strains analyzed (Table 4 and Table 9). Of these indels,25,894 occur in only one strain (Table 9). Because many indels are present in multiple strains, the total number of indels mapped to the genomes is 146,762. Strains exhibit different numbers of indels (Table 4) ranging from a low of 1,494 in strain FGSC 1211 to a high of 24,952 in strain FGSC 1363. Thirteen strains have fewer than 10,000 indels and nine strains have fewer than 5,000 indels. Most strains have ten times more non coding indels than coding indels (Table 4). Indels affecting the splice junction are a small fraction of all indels, ranging from 1 to 3% of coding sequence indels in each strain. Of the distinct indels,16,682 are repeated twice and 8,818 are repeated three times (Table 9). Relatively few distinct coding sequence indels are found more than ten times and there are more distinct indels that are present in all 18 strains than are in ten to seventeen strains combined, suggesting that the indels that are found in all 18 strains actually represent indels present in the reference genome relative to a putative consensus genome. 1,352 annotated ORFs have one indel and 495 contain two indels (Table 10). 198 ORFs have three indels and 96 ORFs have four indels. Fewer than 100 ORFs in total have more than five indels. The distribution of indel sizes was found to be biased, both with regard to size and distribution in the genome. Indels of size +4 or \xe2\x88\x924 nucleotides were more common than would be predicted (Figure 3) and are dominated indels of a few specific sequences. Though neither is overrepresented in the genome, TACC and TAGG, often tandemly repeated, comprise 30% of the tetrameric indels. Indels that are +/\xe2\x88\x92 3 or are a multiple of 3 nucleotides are up to ten times more common among coding sequence than in non-coding regions (Figure 4). Over 24% of all indels of three nucleotides occur in protein coding sequence, whereas less than two percent of indels of two or four nucleotides occur in protein coding sequence. The size of indel that is identifiable by the maq software is dependent upon the length of the read, with insertions being harder to identify. To determine the effect of read length on the ability to identify small indels, we altered the reference of supercontig 1 at evenly spaced intervals to simulate indels, aligned un-altered data to the altered reference, and then determined if maq was able to correctly identify the simulated indels. In general insertions are harder to identify than deletions, and longer reads allow more indels to be identified (Figure S18). BreakDancer (Chen et al. 2009) was used to identify larger events. It is known that this program will report false positive calls, especially for genomes that are repetitive, thus validation of predicted structural variation was necessary, as for FGSC 3921, above, although Neurospora has relatively low levels of repeated sequence (Galagan et al. 2003). Distribution of unique indel sizes among eighteen strains of Neurospora crassa. The number of indels (Y axis) is plotted vs. the size of the indels (X axis). Insertions and deletions are pooled to give a single value for each size (Table S4 in File S1). Indels of size four are strongly overrepresented. Indels that are a multiple of three are also overrepresented. While indels may occur in multiple strains, each indel was only counted once to generate this dataset. Indel size frequency in coding sequence among eighteen strains of Neurospora crassa. The total number of indels of a given size that occur in coding sequence was compared to the total number of indels of the same size and the resulting fraction was multiplied by 100 (Table S5 in File S1). Finally, the distribution of all polymorphisms is not uniform and demonstrates that different regions of each chromosome are inherited as blocks, or haplotypes (Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S3, Figure S4, Figure S5, Figure S6, Figure S7, Figure S8, Figure S9, Figure S10, Figure S11, Figure S12, Figure S13, Figure S14, Figure S15, Figure S16, Figure S17, and Figure S19). It is suggested that such a block occurs around the mating type locus (Pomraning et al. 2011; Wik et al. 2008), which is on supercontig 1 at approximately 1,850,000. While most strains have either uniformly low or uniformly high divergence from the reference genome (e.g., strains 106 or 821 in Figure S3 and Figure S16, respectively) in this region, strains that show abrupt changes from high divergence from the reference genome to low divergence from the reference genome in this region delimit a sub-region from position 1,840,000 on the left (Strain 7035) to position 2,280,000 on the right (in multiple strains), which has no shifts in the level of divergence from the reference genome (Figure 5). This sub-region contains 116 annotated ORFs (Colot et al. 2006) and includes 440 kilobases of DNA sequence. Immediately adjacent to the right end of this sub-region (from 2,280,000 to 2,410,000) is another sub-region with a high number of unique SNPs (in 15 strains). This sub-region contains 1,677 unique SNPs and 2,721 shared SNPs. Of these,4,015 SNPs are non-coding, 123 are synonymous, and only 80 are nonsynonymous. The density of unique SNPs in this region is 13 per kb, as compared to the overall unique SNP density, which ranges from 0.02 per kb (in strain FGSC 309) to 1.8 per kb (in strain 821). The mat a region is defined by high a region of high SNPs from 1,320,000 to 1,940,000 in strain FGSC 3246 (the only mat a strain, shown in Figure 5A). Putative mating type haplotype region. (A) FGSC 3246, (B) FGSC 7035, (C) FGSC 3562, (D) FGSC 3566. Distribution of SNPs and indels on the left arm of supercontig 1 in representative strains. The region from the left telomere through 2.5 million bases is shown. Total SNPs are plotted in blue. SNPs that are unique to each strain are plotted in red. Indels are plotted in green. The total number in a 10 Kb moving window is plotted on the Y axis. The X axis corresponds to the position along the contig. Strain 3246 is mat a while strains 7035,3562, and 3566 are mat A. Four hundred and five distinct nonsense mutations were detected in the current data set for a total of 884 nonsense codons. The number of nonsense mutations varies among strains from a low of 11 in strain FGSC 309 to a high of 137 in strain FGSC 1363 (Table 11). Of these 405 different nonsense mutations, 188 occur once each. Nonsense SNPs occur in 337 different NCUs of which 175 occur in ORFs that have been deleted by the functional genomics program. While many of the ORFs carrying nonsense mutations are hypothetical or putative genes, fifteen of the genes carrying nonsense mutations have annotations in the Neurospora gene compendium, including genes such as sad-2 (NCU04294; (Shiu et al. 2006)), or so (ham-1, NCU02794; (Fleissner et al. 2005)). Only four strains exhibit any variants in sad-2, including two strains, FGSC 821 and FGSC 3921, which feature a nonsense mutation that causes a stop codon at amino acid position 208 out of 1098. This same ORF has no indels in any strains analyzed in the current work. Four strains carry nonsense mutations at amino acid position 21 in NCU09544 (pod-2; (Seiler and Plamann 2003)). Two of these, strains, FGSC 305 and FGSC 1363, have morphological phenotypes, while a third putatively carries a mutation in a regulatory protein, and the last is a male barren mutant. While there are multiple alleles of NCU09544 present among these four strains, all alleles carry the same nonsense mutation and vary in the number SNPs and the sizes of indels present. NCU09544 has been deleted by the Neurospora Functional Genomics program and the resulting mutant (FGSC 12737) has no phenotype (Dunlap et al. 2007) suggesting that the temperature sensitive pod-2 allele previously isolated (Seiler and Plamann 2003) is actually a defective interfering mutation (Fujimura et al. 1993). Multiple nonsense mutations in single ORFs led us to identify two genes that appear to have been RIPed (Freitag et al. 2002), NCU09968 and NCU09969. Neither gene is well conserved across sequenced fungi, although there does appear to be an expansion of putatively NCU09969 related genes in Chaetomium globosum. These two ORFs are adjacent on supercontig 6 and the co-occurrence of polymorphisms in around these two ORFs suggest that they are co-inherited. Neither have been deleted by the functional genomics program. Of the 405 nonsense mutations, 313 (77%) occur in ORFs annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins, 21 as \xe2\x80\x9dhypothetical protein\xe2\x80\x9d and 24 as \xe2\x80\x9cpredicted protein.\xe2\x80\x9d There are 9,734 total ORFs in the dataset, and 6,481 (48%) are conserved hypothetical proteins. Comparing the ratio of nonsense mutations among conserved hypothetical proteins to the ratio of conserved hypothetical proteins among all proteins shows that conserved hypothetical proteins are overrepresented among the ORFs carrying nonsense mutations by nearly 30%. The genome sequence of the strain carrying the introgressed meiotic drive element, Sk-2, has relatively low divergence from the reference genome in terms of SNPs (Table 3) and indels (Table 4). The variants are predominantly seen on supercontig 3, consistent with the genetic identification of the meiotic drive element (Table 6 and Figure S19). The genome sequence data clearly shows that the introgressed region does not include the left telomere on contig 3, but does span the centromere (Figure 6). The number of SNPs on supercontig 3 ranges from a low of 792 in strain FGSC 3246 to a high of 28,243 in strain 322 (Table 6). This variability is not evenly distributed with strains FGSC 322 and FGSC 1363 sharing most SNPs while other strains, such as FGSC 106 and FGSC 305 share SNPs only on the right end. While there are large numbers of SNPs and indels in the introgressed region, in the absence of a complete sequence for N. intermedia, their identity or distribution do not provide significant insight into the nature of the Sk-2 element. Distribution of polymorphisms on supercontig 3. (A) Strain FGSC 3114 containing the introgressed Sk-2 region. (B) Strain FGSC 106 with a vertical arrow showing the location of com. (C) Strain FGSC 305. (D) Strain FGSC 1363. Total SNPs are plotted in blue. Unique SNPs are plotted in red. Indels are plotted in green. Polymorphisms were sorted by supercontig and position and the total number in a 10 Kb moving window is plotted on the Y axis. The X axis corresponds to the position along the supercontig (X 10 Kb). The ability to sample genome sequence of strains that have been highly back-crossed provides an estimate of the upper limit of the rate of spontaneous mutations in sexual reproduction (\xc2\xb5) (Baer et al. 2007). To generate this estimate, the number of SNPs unique to each strain was calculated (Table 8). The distribution of unique SNPs among strains follows a generally Poisson distribution (Figure 2). Strains 106 and 309 were deposited into the FGSC collection in 1960 and had been backcrossed into the reference genome three times. These strains have the lowest number of unique SNPs and hence provide the best estimate for the maximum value of the background mutation rate in the organism. The total sequenced genome size in the current dataset is 41,61,603, and strain FGSC 309 has 704 unique SNPs, which translates to a mutation rate of 1.71 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x925, whereas strain FGSC 106 has 1,033 unique SNPs, which translates to a mutation rate of 2.5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x925. These values are two orders of magnitude lower than the rate suggested in (Drake et al. 1998) who reported a rate of 0.003 for N. crassa. Adding in the unique indels does not significantly change this calculation. Strain FGSC 309 has 123 unique indels and adding these to the 704 unique SNPs gives an estimate for the maximum value of \xc2\xb5 = 2 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x925. While some of the difference in value could be explained by false base calls in our data set, it is doubtful that the false call rate would account for the magnitude of this difference. Our sequencing and analysis has led to the putative identification of sixteen of the seventeen mutations in the strains sequenced, and delimited an introgressed region in the eighteenth strain. Because the sequence of each strain can be evaluated in the context of the sequence of eighteen other strains, the ability to evaluate causative sequence polymorphisms was markedly enhanced. Moreover, since each mutant strain has a defined phenotype that segregates in a limited region of the genome, any sequence polymorphisms that are outside that defined region could be excluded from the specific analysis to identify the lesion responsible for the phenotype. Within the genetically defined region, each sequence polymorphism was evaluated relative to the eighteen other sequences. If a polymorphism occurred in a strain that did not display the mutant phenotype, it was presumed that the sequence polymorphism is not responsible for the phenotype. This procedure constituted, is in one manner of speaking, an in silico bulk analysis. The ability to recover the same mutation by manual sequencing, as in FGSC 7035 or by PCR in FGSC 3921 (Figure 1), provided technical validation of the whole genome sequencing approach. Additionally, these evaluations of putative mutations were strengthened by data from the Neurospora Functional Genomics program (Dunlap et al. 2007), which has generated knockout strains for 7,669 genes (at the time of writing). Of these 7,699,1,271 are only available as heterokaryons. These heterokaryons were not able to be purified by crossing to a wild type strains, suggesting that the deleted ORFs are essential, or at least essential for sexual reproduction. The availability of these mutants as viable homokaryons or as heterokaryons facilitates evaluation of whether the polymorphisms identified by whole genome sequencing would likely be responsible for the phenotypes seen in the mutants sequenced in the current project. Five mutations were associated with knock-out strains exhibiting the same phenotype and seven mutations exhibit similar phenotypes to the phenotypes of classical mutants in the same gene in Neurospora, or in related organisms. While complementing each mutation is outside the scope of the current study, the ability to associate an otherwise anonymous sequence variant with characterized mutations in Neurospora or related organisms validates the approach taken in the current project. The distribution of sequence divergence among these eighteen strains is highly related to the strain histories. Strains that are closely related to the reference genome strain have the lowest sequence divergence relative to the reference genome, while those that were generated in a different background and not crossed into the reference genome background have the highest sequence divergence. For example, strain FGSC 821 is in the Emerson lineage and this strain has the highest sequence divergence from the reference of all the strains. Strains FGSC 106 and FGSC 309 were both deposited into the FGSC collection in 1960, but both bore mutations that had been induced in the reference genome background, and both were backcrossed three times into the reference genome background. Both of these strains have very low sequence divergence from the reference. However, the expectation that the mutations would be found in small regions of relatively high divergence was not supported. Instead, each strain has small regions of high divergence that have the appearance of blocks of DNA that has been inherited together, or haplotypes (Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S3, Figure S4, Figure S5, Figure S6, Figure S7, Figure S8, Figure S9, Figure S10, Figure S11, Figure S12, Figure S13, Figure S14, Figure S15, Figure S16, and Figure S17). The characterization of a region surrounding the mating type locus provides a starting point for additional analysis of haplotype distribution among these strains. The distribution of indels, and especially those whose size is a multiple of three, was highly biased in coding regions (Figure 4). This distribution is similar to the distribution seen in the human genome (Messer and Arndt 2007). Although the present analysis does not include a characterization of the nature of indels, beyond their size and location, the abundance of tetrameric indels was unexpected. Nonsense mutations were identified in a surprisingly large number of exons, which, when considered in the context of the large number of numerous nonsynonymous SNPs, emphasizes the observation that most genes can be deleted with no visible phenotype (Dunlap et al. 2007). The number of nonsense mutations and frameshift inducing insertions and deletions suggest that most of the classical mutant strains carry significant cryptic second-site mutations. Thus careful evaluation of historical functional analysis of classical mutations is warranted. Furthermore, the value of backcrossing a strain into a well characterized genetic background is strongly validated. Our analysis of genomic polymorphisms among eighteen strains of Neurospora crassa has led to identification of the nature of mutations associated with historically described phenotypes. It has also associated some of these classical mutants with other strains that have been characterized both in terms of phenotype and genotype. The ability to evaluate these polymorphisms in the context of classical genetic analysis as well as in the context of a functional genomics program has leveraged the whole genome analysis. The value of the in silico bulk sequence analysis is demonstrated by the facility with which polymorphisms were associated with phenotypes. The added value of the whole genome resequencing has included a characterization of SNP distribution, the identification of unexpected nonsense mutations, and has revealed the strong bias in the size of insertions and deletions relative to their location in coding vs. non-coding sequence. While genome resequencing is becoming more accessible, the ability to find meaningful information in this data, especially when combined with both classical and modern genetic data, is demonstrated by the present approach.

The two component proteins show different degrees of sequence conservation between human and yeast. Here, we determine that Saccharomyces cerevisiae bearing human CDC7 and DBF4 grows comparably to cells with yeast DDK under standard growth conditions. HsDrf1 (a second human Dbf4-like protein) does not support growth, suggesting that HsDbf4 is the true ortholog of ScDbf4. Both human subunits are required to complement yeast cdc7\xce\x94 or dbf4\xce\x94 due to the inability of human Cdc7 or Dbf4 to interact with the corresponding yeast protein. Flow cytometry indicates normal cell cycle progression for yeast containing human DDK. However, yeast containing human DDK is sensitive to long-term exposure to hydroxyurea and fails to sporulate, suggesting that human DDK substitutes for some, but not all, of yeast DDK\xe2\x80\x99s functions. We mapped the region of Cdc7 required for species-specific function of DDK to the C-terminus of Cdc7 by substituting the yeast C-terminal 55 amino acid residues in place of the equivalent human residues. The resulting hybrid protein supported growth of a cdc7\xce\x94 strain only in the presence of ScDBF4. The strain supported by the hybrid CDC7 was not sensitive to HU and formed tetrads. Together, our data indicate that DDK\xe2\x80\x99s targeting of its essential substrate is conserved between species, whereas the interactions within DDK are species specific.Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) is a serine/threonine kinase complex required for the initiation of DNA replication. Both the catalytic subunit (Cdc7) and the regulatory subunit (Dbf4) are essential for growth in budding and fission yeast (Brown and Kelly 1998; Brown and Kelly 1999; Hartwell et al. 1973; Kitada et al. 1992; Masai et al. 1995), acting throughout S-phase to fire origins (Bousset and Diffley 1998; Donaldson et al. 1998). In mammalian cells, depleting Cdc7 or Dbf4 adversely affects DNA replication and cell proliferation (Jiang et al. 1999; Kumagai et al. 1999). DDK requires Cdc7\xe2\x80\x99s kinase activity for function. Its essential substrate is Mcm2-7, the catalytic core of the replicative helicase (Bruck and Kaplan 2009; Ohtoshi et al. 1997; Sheu and Stillman 2006; Sheu and Stillman 2010; Tsuji et al. 2006). Because of its importance in cell cycle progression, Cdc7 is being exploited as a therapeutic target in cancer (Montagnoli et al. 2010; Sawa and Masai 2009; Swords et al. 2010). In addition to its essential role in DNA replication initiation, DDK functions in the S-phase checkpoint, (Costanzo et al. 2003; Dolan et al. 2010; Duncker and Brown 2003; Fung et al. 2002; Gabrielse et al. 2006; Matsumoto et al. 2010; Njagi and Kilbey 1982; Ogi et al. 2008; Pessoa-Brandao and Sclafani 2004; Tsuji et al. 2008; Weinreich and Stillman 1999), mitotic exit (Miller et al. 2009), and meiosis (Katis et al. 2010; Lo et al. 2008; Marston 2009; Nakamura et al. 2002; Valentin et al. 2006; Wan et al. 2008). Yeast and human Cdc7 are well conserved within the kinase family subdomains but much less so in the insertions between the subdomains [Figure 1A; (Hanks et al. 1988; Masai et al. 1995)]. Dbf4 (also called ASK for activator of S-phase kinase in human cells) contains only three short conserved regions, termed N, M, and C (Masai and Arai 2000; Ogino et al. 2001). A second Dbf4-like subunit found in many metazoans, Drf1 (Dbf4-related factor 1, also called DBF4B or ASKL1) forms an independent kinase complex with Cdc7 (Montagnoli et al. 2002; Takahashi and Walter 2005; Yoshizawa-Sugata et al. 2005). Drf1 (DBF4B) should not be confused with DIAP1, also referred to as DRF1 (diaphanous-related formin 1) in humans. Depletion of Drf1 perturbs the cell cycle in human cells, but the phenotype is less severe than depletion of Cdc7 or Dbf4 (Yoshizawa-Sugata et al. 2005). In Xenopus, Drf1 and Dbf4 are developmentally regulated, with each being essential at different life stages (Takahashi and Walter 2005). A second Dbf4 subunit is not found in S. cerevisiae. To evaluate the degree of functional conservation between human and budding yeast DDK with the goal of providing a genetically amenable system to study the structure and function of human DDK, we tested whether human Cdc7, Dbf4, and/or Drf1 substitute for DDK\xe2\x80\x99s essential activity in S. cerevisiae. We find that human (Hs) CDC7 and DBF4, but not DRF1, complement deletion of the yeast genes. Both HsCDC7 and HsDBF4 must be present for complementation, a result that agrees with a lack of interaction between the yeast and human proteins. Yeast strains with human DDK are sensitive to hydroxyurea (HU), a phenotype associated with some Dbf4 mutations (Gabrielse et al. 2006; Harkins et al. 2009; Jones et al. 2010), and do not form tetrads. By substituting the C-terminal 55 amino acid residues of yeast Cdc7 in place of the C-terminal 52 amino acid residues of human Cdc7, we generated a hybrid Cdc7 molecule that functions with ScDbf4 but not HsDbf4. Interestingly, changing the Dbf4 specificity of HsCdc7 to ScDbf4 relieves the HU sensitivity, suggesting that resistance to HU is provided by Dbf4. We thus demonstrate that the recognition of essential targets is conserved between DDK of different species despite the lack of cross-species interaction between the subunits. The results have implications for the study of Cdc7 and Dbf4 as targets for drug therapies and in the development of synthetic genomes.'","b'The DDK kinase complex, composed of Cdc7 and Dbf4, is required for S-phase progression.

The results have implications for the study of Cdc7 and Dbf4 as targets for drug therapies and in the development of synthetic genomes. All molecules were amplified by PCR using Pwo polymerase (Roche) and the primers in Table S1. A 3 kb SalI-SbfI fragment containing the promoter and coding regions of ScDBF4 was cloned into the URA3 centromeric plasmid YCplac33 (Gietz and Sugino 1988). ScCDC7, HsCDC7, and HsDBF4 were expressed from the ScCDC7 promoter, inserted as SmaI-SalI fragments into YCplac33 (URA3-CEN) or YCplac111 [LEU2-CEN; (Gietz and Sugino 1988)]. Coding sequences were inserted using an NdeI site placed at the ATG start codon and downstream HindIII (ScCDC7), SbfI (HsCDC7, HsDBF4), or NdeI sites (HsDRF1). cDNA clones for human CDC7, DBF4, and DRF1 were purchased from Open Biosystems (accession numbers BC11044, BC047693, and MHS1011-74961). Human genes were transferred to the 2 \xc2\xb5 LEU2 episomal plasmid YEplac181 (Gietz and Sugino 1988) using SacI-SbfI (HsCDC7, HsDBF4) or SmaI-BamHI (DRF1). The LEU2 markers of YCplac111-HsCDC7 and YEplac181-HsCDC7 were switched to HIS3 with pLH7 (Cross 1997), yielding YCplac111h-HsCDC7 and YEplac181h-HsCDC7. The URA3 marker on YCplac33-ScDBF4 was switched to LEU2 with pUL9 (Cross 1997). Myc9-tagged versions of the human proteins were inserted into YCp88-myc9 (Hoke et al. 2008) as NotI-SacI or NotI-EcoRI fragments. A plasmid encoding both ScCDC7 and ScDBF4 (YCplac33-ScCDC7-ScDBF4) was constructed by inserting a SmaI-XbaI fragment containing the ScCDC7 promoter and ORF (amplified using MD405 and MD438) into YCplac33-ScDBF4. C-terminal fragments of ScCdc7 were substituted in place of the corresponding HsCdc7 regions using gene splicing by overlapping extension PCR (Horton et al. 1990) and inserted as NdeI-SbfI fragments into YEplac181 with the ScCDC7 promoter to yield YEplac181-CDC7-S1, YEplac181-CDC7-S2, and YEplac181-CDC7-S3. The LEU2 marker on these plasmids was switched to HIS3 using pLH7 (Cross 1997). Strains are listed in Table S2. Heterozygous deletion strains (BY23713, cdc7\xe2\x88\x860; BY23988, dbf4\xe2\x88\x860) (Giaever et al. 2002) and TAP-tagged Cdc7 and Dbf4 strains (Ghaemmaghami et al. 2003) were purchased from Open Biosystems. To generate haploid deletion strains complemented by plasmid copies, BY23713 was transformed with YCplac33-ScCDC7, and BY23988 with YCplac33-ScDBF4. Transformants were sporulated and G418 resistant colonies selected (MDY95: MATa, cdc7\xe2\x88\x860, YCplac33-ScCDC7; CY4104: MAT\xce\xb1, dbf4\xe2\x88\x860, YCplac33-ScDBF4). To generate a diploid strain deleted for cdc7 and dbf4, KanMX in CY4104 was switched to NatMX by transformation with linearized p4339 (Tong and Boone 2006), creating CY4178. CY4178 was mated to MDY95 and the URA3 plasmids shuffled out, creating CY4348 (cdc7::KanMX dbf4::NatMX). CY4348 was then transformed with YEplac181-HsDBF4 and YCplac111h-HsCDC7 or YEplac181h-HsCDC7, sporulated and His+, Leu+, Ura\xe2\x88\x92, G418, and ClonNAT resistant colonies identified to generate CY4240 and CY4242. To generate a double deletion strain complemented by ScCDC7 and ScDBF4, YCplac111-ScCDC7 was shuffled into MDY95 to yield MDY195. Diploids from a MDY195 and CY4178 mating were sporulated. Leu+, Ura+, and MATa spore colonies that were G418 and ClonNAT resistant were identified (CY4481: cdc7\xe2\x88\x860 dbf4\xe2\x88\x860; YCplac111-ScCDC7, YCplac33-ScDBF4). A strain deleted for both cdc7 and dbf4 containing YCplac33-ScCDC7-ScDBF4 was created by transforming CY4240 (MAT\xce\xb1 cdc7::KanMX dbf4::NatMX YCplac111h-HsCDC7 YCplac181-HsDBF4) with YCplac33-ScCDC7-ScDBF4. After several passages in YPD, colonies that were Ura+, Leu\xe2\x88\x92, His\xe2\x88\x92, and 5-FOA sensitive were screened to yield MDY214 (MAT\xce\xb1 cdc7::KanMX dbf4::NatMX YCplac33-ScCDC7-ScDBF4). For homozygous diploid strains deleted at cdc7 and dbf4, CY4242 (MATa cdc7::KanMX dbf4::NatMX YCplac181h-HsCDC7 YCplac181-HsDBF4) and MDY214 were mated to create MDY270. Treatment with 5-FOA generated a strain containing only human DDK (CY5628; MATa/MAT\xce\xb1 cdc7::KanMX dbf4::NatMX YCplac181h-HsCDC7 YCplac181-HsDBF4). After several passages of MDY270 through YPD, Ura+, Leu\xe2\x88\x92, and His\xe2\x88\x92 colonies were identified to generate CY5627 (MATa/MAT\xce\xb1 cdc7::KanMX dbf4::NatMX YCplac33-ScCDC7-ScDBF4). CY5627 was transformed with YEplac181h-CDC7-S1, and YCplac33L-ScDBF4, His+, and Leu+ colonies selected, and then the strain (MDY317) was plated on 5-FOA to yield MDY318. Yeast strains CY4240 (HsDDK) and CY4481 (ScDDK) were grown in YPD to an OD600 of \xe2\x88\xbc0.6, incubated in 100 mM hydroxyurea (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 30\xc2\xb0, washed twice, and then resuspended in fresh YPD. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times, pelleted, and resuspended in 70% ethanol. Cell sorting was performed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) by the London Regional Flow Cytometry Facility. Log phase cells (4 \xc3\x97 1010 cells) were harvested by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold water, and resuspended in 3 ml lysis buffer [25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 0.1% (v/v) NP40]. Cell extracts were made as described by Schultz et al. (1991). After centrifugation, the supernatant (\xe2\x88\xbc4 ml, 15\xe2\x80\x9320 mg protein/ml) was mixed with 50 \xc2\xb5l Epoxy M270 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) coupled to rabbit IgG (\xe2\x88\xbc7 mg IgG/ml beads). After 2 h at 4\xc2\xb0, beads were collected and the supernatant removed. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer, once in 200 \xc2\xb5l lysis buffer, and then incubated in 50 \xc2\xb5l SDS loading dye at 90\xc2\xb0 for 5 min. The elutions were analyzed by Western blotting. Primary antibodies were anti-ScCdc7 yN-18 and anti-ScDbf4 yA-16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and monoclonal anti c-myc (Sigma-Aldrich). Rabbit anti-goat and goat anti-mouse antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were from Sigma-Aldrich. Detection using chemiluminscence followed the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions (SuperSignal West Pico Kit; Pierce Biotechnology). To address the degree of functional conservation between yeast and human DDK subunits, we tested whether the individual human subunits were able to substitute for their yeast counterparts. We expressed HsCDC7 or HsDBF4 from centromeric and 2 \xc2\xb5 plasmids (Gietz and Sugino 1988) and examined their ability to support viability by plasmid shuffling. The initial analysis was performed with CDC7 in which a haploid yeast strain deleted for cdc7 (Giaever et al. 2002) and complemented by a URA3 plasmid encoding ScCDC7 was transformed with either low copy or multicopy plasmids encoding HsCDC7. Cells were plated on 5-FOA where viability requires that the human gene substitutes for its yeast ortholog. As shown in Figure 2A (rows 1, 2), neither the low copy nor the multicopy plasmid encoding HsCDC7 supported viability of the cdc7\xce\x94 strain. In similar tests, HsDBF4 did not support growth of dbf4\xce\x94 (Figure 2A, rows 3, 4). Human CDC7 and DBF4 do not interact with their yeast counterparts. A) Haploid cdc7 (rows 1, 2, and 5) or dbf4 (rows 3 and 4) deletion strains [BY23713, cdc7\xe2\x88\x860; BY23988, dbf4\xe2\x88\x860; (Giaever et al. 2002)] transformed with the cognate yeast gene on a URA3 encoding plasmid (Gietz and Sugino 1988) were transformed with the indicated CEN or 2 \xc2\xb5 plasmids (Gietz and Sugino 1988) encoding copies of HsCDC7, HsDBF4, or ScCDC7. Cell suspensions were diluted and then spotted on YPD (left) or 5-FOA\xe2\x80\x93containing media (right) and grown at 30\xc2\xb0 for two and three days, respectively. B) TAP-ScDbf4\xe2\x80\x93associated proteins from extracts containing the indicated proteins were isolated using rabbit IgG coupled Epoxy M270 Dynabeads and then probed for the presence of ScCdc7 or myc9-HsCdc7 by Western blotting. \xe2\x80\x9cR\xe2\x80\x9d indicates recombinant yeast Cdc7 [\xe2\x88\xbc100 ng; (Stead et al. 2011)], \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d the input extract (\xe2\x88\xbc1/100 of total), and \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d bound protein. C) A similar experiment to probe for the association of ScDbf4 and myc9-HsDbf4 with TAP-ScCdc7. D and E) Control experiments showing that the TAP-tagged proteins are enriched by the IgG beads (left panels) and that binding of ScCdc7 (D) or ScDbf4 (E) to the beads depends on the presence of TAP-ScDbf4 or TAP-ScCdc7, respectively. The \xe2\x80\x9cno tag\xe2\x80\x9d strain is BY4741. \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x9d is the wash. The lack of complementation could be explained by the inability of HsCdc7 and HsDbf4 to interact with their yeast counterparts. To test this possibility, we compared the interaction of ScCdc7 and myc9-tagged HsCdc7 with ScDbf4 fused to a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag (Rigaut et al. 1999). Proteins that interacted with affinity-purified TAP-ScDbf4 were detected by Western blotting. As expected, we detected a robust signal for ScCdc7 in the fraction eluting with TAP-ScDbf4 (Figure 2B, left, D). In contrast to ScCdc7, myc9-HsCdc7 was not associated with TAP-ScDbf4, even though there was a strong signal for this protein in the cell lysate (Figure 2B, right). Similar experiments with TAP-ScCdc7 and myc9-HsDbf4 did not detect an interaction between ScCdc7 and HsDbf4 (Figure 2C, E). A reciprocal experiment in which antibodies to the human proteins were used also did not identify a complex of yeast and human proteins (supporting information, Figure S1). We therefore concluded that HsCdc7 and HsDbf4 fail to interact with ScDbf4 and ScCdc7, respectively. Since a cross-species DDK complex did not form, we wondered whether supplying both human genes would allow complementation of cdc7\xce\x94 or dbf4\xce\x94. To test this, we repeated the plasmid shuffling, supplying copies of both HIS3-HsCDC7 and LEU2-HsDBF4 (Figure 3A). Strains containing HsCDC7 and multicopy HsDBF4 were viable regardless of whether the yeast strain was deleted in cdc7 or dbf4 (Figure 3A, rows 3, 4). HsCDC7 was functional when expressed from either centromeric or multicopy plasmids. In contrast, only the multicopy plasmid bearing HsDBF4 complemented. Complementation of cdc7\xce\x94dbf4\xce\x94 by human DDK. A) Haploid strains deleted for dbf4 or cdc7 (Giaever et al. 2002) and bearing the indicated plasmids encoding yeast and human CDC7 and/or DBF4 were spotted on YPD and 5-FOA plates and then grown at 30\xc2\xb0 for two and three days, respectively. B) Haploid strains deleted for cdc7 and dbf4 (cdc7::KanMX dbf4::NatMX) and bearing the indicated plasmids encoding yeast or human CDC7 and DBF4 were spotted on YPD plates and then grown at 16\xc2\xb0 for seven days, or 30\xc2\xb0 or 37\xc2\xb0 for two days. C) MDY214 was transformed with CEN or multicopy plasmids encoding HsDRF1 and HsCDC7 as indicated. Five thousand cells and 10-fold serial dilutions were plated on YPD and 5-FOA and grown at 30\xc2\xb0 for one and three days. As a control, MDY214 transformed with HsCDC7 and HsDBF4 is also shown (bottom rows). To determine whether the presence of ScDBF4 or ScCDC7 contributed to the activity of human DDK, we constructed a diploid strain (CY4348) heterozygous for deletion of both CDC7 (cdc7::KanMX) and DBF4 (dbf4::NatMX) in which the deletions provided resistance to G418 and ClonNAT, respectively. CY4348 was transformed with plasmids encoding HsCDC7 and HsDBF4. After sporulation and tetrad dissection, spore colonies that were both G418 and ClonNAT resistant were obtained. These spore colonies were all His+ (HsCDC7) and Leu+ (HsDBF4), indicating that HsDDK substitutes for ScDDK\xe2\x80\x99s essential function. PCR analysis confirmed that neither ScCDC7 nor ScDBF4 were present in the HsDDK strains (Figure S2). No major differences in growth between cells containing plasmid-encoded human or yeast DDK were noted at 16\xc2\xb0, 30\xc2\xb0, or 37\xc2\xb0 (Figure 3B). In addition, cells bearing HsDDK grew at the same rate in liquid media as strains containing plasmid-encoded ScDDK (Figure S3). Thus, we concluded that a complex of HsCdc7 and HsDbf4, comprising HsDDK, substitutes for ScDDK and that this complex is sufficient to support viability in a temperature-independent manner. Many metazoans contain a second homolog to Dbf4 called Drf1 (Furukohri et al. 2003; Montagnoli et al. 2002; Yoshizawa-Sugata et al. 2005). Depletion of Drf1 from cultured human cells interferes with cell cycle progression, but the phenotype is not as severe as depletion of Cdc7 or Dbf4 (Yoshizawa-Sugata et al. 2005). To determine whether HsDRF1 would support viability of yeast in place of HsDBF4, we cotransformed HsDRF1 on either LEU2 2 \xc2\xb5 or CEN plasmids with HsCDC7 into the cdc7\xce\x94 dbf4\xce\x94 strain maintained by a URA3 plasmid encoding ScCDC7 and ScDBF4. Spotting the transformants on 5-FOA determined that HsDRF1 (with HsCDC7) was unable to complement cdc7\xce\x94 dbf4\xce\x94 (Figure 3C) under conditions in which HsDBF4 supports viability. Western blotting of a strain containing myc-tagged Drf1 indicated that it was expressed (Figure S4). These results suggest that HsDBF4 is the true ortholog of ScDBF4. To address whether the cell cycle proceeds normally in yeast supported by human DDK, we performed flow cytometry on asynchronous cultures and synchronized cells arrested in mid\xe2\x80\x93S phase using HU, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase that induces the S-phase checkpoint and prevents firing of late origins. In asynchronous cultures, there were similar ratios of replicated and unreplicated cells (2C and 1C, respectively) for the human DDK and yeast DDK strains (Figure 4, top panel). Flow cytometry was also performed on cells arrested with HU, and then at different times after release from the block. Strains bearing HsDDK showed a similar pattern, but they were slightly slower in progressing through the cell cycle than cells with ScDDK after release from HU, particularly in the initial recovery from HU (Figure 4, 30 min time point). Effect of human DDK on the cell cycle progression of yeast. The progression of the cell cycle after arrest and release with HU was examined for a strain containing HsDDK (CY4240; cdc7::KanMX dbf4::NatMX YCplac111h-HsCDC7 YCplac181-HsDBF4) or plasmid-encoded ScDDK (CY4481; cdc7::KanMX dbf4::NatMX, YCplac111-ScCDC7, YCplac33-ScDBF4). Log phase cells were incubated in 100 mM hydroxyurea (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 30\xc2\xb0, washed twice, and then resuspended in fresh YPD. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times and subsequently examined for DNA content by FACS. The top panel is the analysis of asynchronously growing cells. The positions of cells containing 1C and 2C DNA content are indicated below. DDK is important for yeast to respond to replicative stress. Mutations of Dbf4 result in sensitivity to genotoxic agents (Fung et al. 2002; Gabrielse et al. 2006; Harkins et al. 2009; Njagi and Kilbey 1982; Varrin et al. 2005). To examine whether HsDDK substitutes for ScDDK in this regard, we grew yeast strains containing human or yeast DDK under conditions of replicative stress. As shown in Figure 5, strains containing HsDDK were more sensitive to HU compared with strains containing ScDDK. The sensitivity to HU was independent of HsCDC7 copy number. Note that in these experiments, the exposure to HU was continuous, whereas in the flow cytometry experiments the exposure to HU was relatively brief. A similar phenotype was observed with S. cerevisiae Dbf4 mutants (Jones et al. 2010). No changes in growth were noted with HsDDK on plates containing methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), a DNA-damaging agent (Figure 5). Effects of human DDK on the response of yeast to genotoxic agents. The haploid strain (cdc7::KanMX dbf4::NatMX) deleted for both cdc7 and dbf4 and bearing the indicated plasmids encoding yeast or human CDC7 and DBF4 were spotted (5000 cells and 10-fold serial dilutions) on YPD plates as well as YPD plates containing 150 mM HU or 0.03% MMS. Cells were grown for two days at 30\xc2\xb0. DDK is required for recombination and segregation events during meiosis in yeast (Marston 2009). To examine whether human DDK can substitute for yeast DDK during meiosis, we generated diploid homozygous cdc7\xce\x94 dbf4\xce\x94 strains bearing either ScDDK (CY5627) or HsDDK (CY5628) on plasmids. Each of the diploid strains was incubated in 1% potassium acetate for 5 to 7 days, and then examined for tetrads. Ten out of 10 sporulation cultures of the ScDDK strain contained tetrads, whereas none of the HsDDK sporulation cultures contained tetrads. Furthermore, the HsDDK cells had an abnormal appearance (Figure 6). The lack of tetrads with HsDDK was consistent with previous studies using mutations in DDK (Lo et al. 2008; Matos et al. 2008). The inhibition of sporulation by HsDDK was recessive as a strain with both human and yeast DDK (MDY270) contained tetrads after incubation in potassium acetate (Figure 6). HsDDK diploids do not support meiosis. Light microscope images (400\xc3\x97) of diploid strains deleted at cdc7 and dbf4 with plasmid-encoded HsDDK and/or ScDDK. Images are of strains after at least five days incubation in 1% potassium acetate at 30\xc2\xb0. In S. cerevisiae, the region of Cdc7 that interacts with ScDbf4 maps to a 55 amino acid residue region at the C-terminus of ScCdc7 using yeast two-hybrid analysis (Jackson et al. 1993). While this region interacts with Dbf4, no information is available on whether the C-terminal 55 amino acid residues of ScCdc7 are sufficient to direct formation of a functional DDK complex. To address this, we created an allele in which amino acid residues 523-574 of HsCdc7 were replaced with residues 450-507 of ScCdc7 (Figure 7A). This chimeric allele was expressed on a LEU2 2 \xc2\xb5 plasmid that was then shuffled into MDY99 (cdc7::KanMX ScCDC7-URA3). Cells containing the hybrid protein (Cdc7-S1) grew as well as cells containing ScCdc7 on 5-FOA (Figure 7B). In contrast, when shorter regions of the C-terminus (Cdc7-S2 and Cdc7-S3 in Figure 7A) were substituted, the hybrid proteins were unable to support viability of a cdc7\xce\x94 strain. Western blotting of the swapped constructs, tagged with myc9, indicated that the proteins were expressed (Figure S5). These results thus identify the C-terminal 55 amino acid residues as critical in defining the species specificity of S. cerevisiae Cdc7. Definition of the species-specific interaction region in Cdc7. A) Positions of each swap are shown, as are schematics of the full-length proteins, with human sequences in white and yeast sequences in gray. B) Haploid cdc7\xce\x94 strains supported with URA3-ScCDC7 were transformed with LEU2 plasmids encoding HsCDC7, ScCDC7, or the indicated yeast-human CDC7 chimeras. The strains were diluted serially and then spotted on 5-FOA. C) Haploid dbf4 deletion strain with URA3-ScDBF4 was transformed with both LEU2-HsDBF4 and a HIS3 2 \xc2\xb5 plasmid encoding wild-type HsCDC7 or a chimera. The strains were serially diluted and spotted on YPD and 5-FOA. D) Strains deleted at cdc7 complemented by ScCDC7 or CDC7-S1 were diluted and spotted on YPD or YPD containing 150 mM HU. For comparison, strains deleted at both cdc7 and dbf4 containing either ScDDK or HsDDK were also spotted. E) Image of a tetrad after incubation of MDY318 in potassium acetate (400\xc3\x97). To determine whether replacement of the C-terminal 52 amino acid residues of HsCdc7 with yeast sequence interferes with the interaction between HsCdc7 and HsDbf4, we tested whether CDC7-S1 forms functional DDK with HsDbf4. As shown in Figure 7C, CDC7-S1 did not support growth of a dbf4\xce\x94 HsDBF4 strain, identifying a key role of the C-terminal 52 amino acid residues of HsCdc7 in species-specific formation of functional DDK, consistent with the requirement of amino acid residues 566-572 for interaction with HsDbf4 (Kitamura et al. 2011). We were unable to examine whether the shorter swaps (Cdc7-S2 and Cdc7-S3) support viability of dbf4\xce\x94 HsDBF4 because we did not obtain transformants with these plasmids. As shown above, strains containing HsDDK are sensitive to HU. To address whether this HU sensitivity is due to HsCDC7 or HsDBF4, we compared the growth of the cdc7\xce\x94 strains containing plasmid-encoded ScCDC7 or CDC7-S1 and ScDBF4 on YPD and HU. The CDC7-S1 strain grew comparably to the ScCDC7 strain on both media, suggesting that the Dbf4 subunit provides the target specificity for the response to HU. We also examined whether CDC7-S1 supports sporulation; recall that the diploid strain with HsDDK does not form tetrads. We transformed CDC7-S1 HIS3 and ScDBF4 LEU2 into CY5627 (cdc7\xce\x94/cdc7\xce\x94 dbf4\xce\x94/dbf4\xce\x94 ScCDC7-ScDBF4-URA3), treated the cells with 5-FOA to remove ScCDC7, and then incubated the resulting strain (MDY318) in potassium acetate. As seen in Figure 7E, tetrads were detected, suggesting that the defect in sporulation with HsDDK was in HsDbf4. We established that the essential function of DDK is conserved between yeast and humans despite limited sequence conservation between the Dbf4 orthologs. These findings also demonstrate that it is their function as a complex rather than independent subunits that is essential for viability. Of note, in this two-component enzyme, the structure required for targeting of DDK to its essential substrates is conserved, but the regions required for interaction of the component proteins, Cdc7 and Dbf4, are not. In yeast, the Mcm4 subunit of Mcm2-7, the replicative helicase, is the essential substrate of DDK. Phosphomimetic substitutions at the DDK target sites of Mcm4 bypass the requirement for CDC7 and/or DBF4 (Randell et al. 2010; Sheu and Stillman 2010). Targeting of Mcm4 is thought to occur through the Cdc7 subunit, which recognizes a \xe2\x80\x9cdocking\xe2\x80\x9d site in a conserved region of Mcm4 (Sheu and Stillman 2006). Other Mcms are also substrates for DDK, including Mcm2 and Mcm6. Phosphorylation of Mcm6, with phosphorylation of Mcm4, is important for the initiation of DNA replication (Randell et al. 2010). Mutation of DDK-phosphorylation sites in Mcm2 does not affect viability; however, phosphorylation of Mcm2 by DDK may be important in the response to DNA damage (Randell et al. 2010; Stead et al. 2011). The sensitivity of the HsDDK-containing strain to HU but not MMS indicates that HsDDK can perform some, but not all, of ScDDK\xe2\x80\x99s functions in response to stress and is consistent with reports indicating that different regions of Dbf4 are required for the response to HU and MMS (Fung et al. 2002; Gabrielse et al. 2006). Interestingly, the strain maintained by Cdc7-S1 and ScDbf4 was resistant to HU, implicating Dbf4 as the important subunit within DDK for providing resistance to HU, although it is still formally possible that the C-terminal 55 residues of ScCdc7 are important for resistance to HU. The ability of ScDbf4 to confer resistance to HU suggests that it may have important roles in defining target molecules during the response to HU. Indeed, recognition of Mcm2 by DDK is thought to occur through the Dbf4 subunit in yeast. Mutations in Dbf4 that interfere with Mcm2 interaction include those that lead to sensitivity to HU (Jones et al. 2010). Interestingly, the sensitivity of HsDDK strains to HU is suppressed by a version of Mcm2 with phosphomimetic glutamic acid residue substitutions at the DDK target sites S164 and S170 (Stead et al. 2011). The targeting of Mcm2 by Dbf4 contrasts with the observation that Mcm4 recognition occurs through Cdc7 (Sheu and Stillman 2006; Bernard Duncker, personal communication) and provides an explanation for conservation of the sequences required to target Mcm4 but not Mcm2. Interestingly, ScDbf4 (with Cdc7-S1) also rescued the defect in sporulation with HsDDK. Not surprisingly, interaction of ScDDK with Cdc5, required for meiosis, is mediated by ScDbf4 (Chen and Weinreich 2010; Matos et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2009). Jackson et al. (1993) found the C-terminal 55 amino acid residues of ScCdc7 sufficient for interaction with Dbf4 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. We determined that the C-terminal 55 amino acid residues of yeast Dbf4 are necessary and sufficient for species-specific formation of functional DDK. Swapping shorter portions of the C-terminus did not support formation of a functional DDK with ScDbf4, suggesting that the region encompassing amino acid residues 449-561 of ScCdc7 is required for interaction with ScDbf4. The C-terminus of HsCdc7 is likely required for formation of functional DDK with HsDbf4, as replacement of the human C-terminal 52 amino acid residues with yeast sequence was not functional with HsDbf4. To examine whether the C-terminal residues of yeast and human Cdc7 are conserved through fungi and animals, we compared the \xe2\x88\xbc55 C-terminal residues from various organisms (Figure 8). The human sequence was strongly conserved among many metazoan species, particularly in the C-terminal proximal residues (residues 534-573 of human). Note that this region includes Motif XI of the eukaryotic kinase domain (Hanks et al. 1988; Hess et al. 1998). The strong similarity of the C-terminal region in multicellular eukaryotes suggests there is a selective pressure to maintain this sequence at this position of the protein. Many of these species also contain a second Dbf4 subunit (Drf1) or, in the case of mouse, two Dbf4 isoforms. Therefore, one pressure to maintain the C-terminal sequence may be its requirement to interact with two different subunits. Of note, the C terminus of the D. melanogaster Cdc7 protein (NP 727103) showed less similarity to human Cdc7 than the Cdc7 C-termini from other metazoans, even though D. melanogaster is predicted to encode two Dbf4 isoforms (NP 723965.1 and NP 523583.2). We speculate that this results from the fruit fly encoding a second Cdc7-like protein (NP 609876.2). The similarity among fungal species was not as strong as the similarity between most metazoan species. Interestingly, the strongest region of similarity within the fungal species corresponded to residues 441-523 of ScCdc7, which includes Motif XI and is consistent with the requirement of residues 449-561 for interaction with ScDbf4. With the exception of S. pombe, which encodes a second sporulation-specific Cdc7-Dbf4 complex (Nakamura et al. 2002), the fungal species contain only single Cdc7 and Dbf4 subunits. Our data suggest that Motif XI of Cdc7 encodes species-specific interaction with Dbf4. Alignment of Cdc7 C-terminal sequences.

h protein sequences are in Table S3. Black boxes indicate conserved residues and gray boxes similar residues in at least 50% of the sequences at the same position. The position of Motif XI is indicated for each alignment. To our knowledge, this is the first instance where complementation of a kinase deletion in yeast by the human ortholog requires the regulatory subunit. The complementation of a S. pombe cdc2 deletion was famously used to clone human cdc2, a cyclin-dependent kinase, but it did not require expression of human cyclins to function (Lee and Nurse 1987). In addition, the human gene encoding the catalytic subunit of casein kinase II (CK2\xce\xb1) complements deletion of the S. cerevisiae genes (there are two different catalytic subunits in budding yeast) without need of the regulatory subunit (Dotan et al. 2001). With DDK, the requirement of the regulatory subunit to achieve complementation serves as a guide for creation of hybrid synthetic genomes where consideration of the structure/function of multicomponent enzymes will be required. Of note, the component genes of DDK are found on different arms of the same chromosome (IV) in S. cerevisiae but on different chromosomes (1 and 7) in humans. The species specificity of Cdc7-Dbf4 interaction is a potential area to exploit for the development of anti-mycotic drugs. Additionally, this genetically amenable system can be used to rapidly probe the key structure/function relationships of HsCdc7 and its interactions with potential cancer therapeutics. Human DDK in yeast may also prove useful for study of DDK\xe2\x80\x99s nonessential roles in DNA-damage response and meiosis.

Brewer']","October 4, 2011.",Replication Stress-Induced Chromosome Breakage Is Correlated with Replication Fork Progression and Is Preceded by Single-Stranded DNA Formation,"b'Chromosome breakage as a result of replication stress has been hypothesized to be the direct consequence of defective replication fork progression, or \xe2\x80\x9ccollapsed\xe2\x80\x9d replication forks. However, direct and genome-wide evidence that collapsed replication forks give rise to chromosome breakage is still lacking. Previously we showed that a yeast replication checkpoint mutant mec1-1, after transient exposure to replication impediment imposed by hydroxyurea (HU), failed to complete DNA replication, accumulated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at the replication forks, and fragmented its chromosomes. In this study, by following replication fork progression genome-wide via ssDNA detection and by direct mapping of chromosome breakage after HU exposure, we have tested the hypothesis that the chromosome breakage in mec1 cells occurs at collapsed replication forks. We demonstrate that sites of chromosome breakage indeed correlate with replication fork locations. Moreover, ssDNA can be detected prior to chromosome breakage, suggesting that ssDNA accumulation is the common precursor to double strand breaks at collapsed replication forks.Chromosome fragile sites (CFS) were first identified in humans as specific regions of constrictions, gaps, or breaks on metaphase chromosomes after cells were exposed to chemicals that inhibit DNA replication (Sutherland 1979). As CFSs are hot spots for genomic rearrangement, their identification is important for understanding the mechanisms of genomic instability induced by replication stress. Although the exact nature of molecular events causing chromosome fragility is still elusive, increasing evidence suggests that delayed or defective replication fork progression through fragile sites may be one of the underlying causes of chromosome fragility. Studies using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae under a variety of conditions have also described chromosome fragility that stems either from intrinsic properties of DNA templates or from reagents that interfere with DNA replication and/or compromise the checkpoint control mechanism (Admire et al. 2006; Casper et al. 2009; Casper et al. 2008; Cha and Kleckner 2002; Lemoine et al. 2005; Raveendranathan et al. 2006). The unifying hypothesis for the observed chromosome fragility is that replication stress causes the destabilization or \xe2\x80\x9ccollapse\xe2\x80\x9d of the replication forks at specific regions of the chromosomes where fragility occurs. The corollary to this hypothesis is that breakage at CFSs is correlated with altered replication fork progression under the stress conditions. However, direct evidence for a correlation between chromosome breakage and replication fork progression is still absent. Previously, we reported that when checkpoint-deficient mec1-1 cells are exposed to HU at the beginning of S phase, ssDNA accumulates at the replication forks that arise from origin activation (Feng et al. 2009). Moreover, after the removal of HU, replication forks are incapable of resuming DNA synthesis, and cells suffer extensive chromosome breakage. We hypothesized that chromosome breakage occurs, at least in part, as a consequence of chromosomes being under persistent tension exerted by the mitotic spindle. Consistent with this hypothesis was our observation that breakage was evident near a centromere located on a chromosome capable of bi-orientation on the spindle (CEN2) but not near a centromere on a chromosome unable to achieve bi-orientation (CEN4) (Feng et al. 2009). We also reasoned that it is unlikely that the chromosome breakage occurred as a direct consequence of the mechanical force exerted by the spindle; rather, chromosome breakage occurred as a result of a more open and vulnerable chromatin environment due to spindle extension. Thus, we believed that chromosome breakage might not be restricted to the centromere-proximal regions. In this study, we set out to test the hypothesis that CFSs map to sites of replication fork \xe2\x80\x9ccollapse\xe2\x80\x9d by simultaneously mapping replication fork progression and sites of chromosome fragility. We monitored replication fork progression indirectly by detecting ssDNA production at replication forks and identified chromosome breakage sites by direct mapping of double-stranded breaks (DSB) using a new method. As predicted, we saw a strong correlation between fork locations and sites of chromosome breakage. Furthermore, accumulation of ssDNA preceded the detectable appearance of DSBs, suggesting that ssDNA formation at replication forks is a precursor to chromosome breakage at those locations.'","b'Chromosome breakage as a result of replication stress has been hypothesized to be the direct consequence of defective replication fork progression, or \xe2\x80\x9ccollapsed\xe2\x80\x9d replication forks. However, direct and genome-wide evidence that collapsed replication forks give rise to chromosome breakage is still lacking. Previously we showed that a yeast replication checkpoint mutant mec1-1, after transient exposure to replication impediment imposed by hydroxyurea (HU), failed to complete DNA replication, accumulated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at the replication forks, and fragmented its chromosomes. In this study, by following replication fork progression genome-wide via ssDNA detection and by direct mapping of chromosome breakage after HU exposure, we have tested the hypothesis that the chromosome breakage in mec1 cells occurs at collapsed replication forks. We demonstrate that sites of chromosome breakage indeed correlate with replication fork locations. Moreover, ssDNA can be detected prior to chromosome breakage, suggesting that ssDNA accumulation is the common precursor to double strand breaks at collapsed replication forks. Chromosome fragile sites (CFS) were first identified in humans as specific regions of constrictions, gaps, or breaks on metaphase chromosomes after cells were exposed to chemicals that inhibit DNA replication (Sutherland 1979). As CFSs are hot spots for genomic rearrangement, their identification is important for understanding the mechanisms of genomic instability induced by replication stress. Although the exact nature of molecular events causing chromosome fragility is still elusive, increasing evidence suggests that delayed or defective replication fork progression through fragile sites may be one of the underlying causes of chromosome fragility. Studies using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae under a variety of conditions have also described chromosome fragility that stems either from intrinsic properties of DNA templates or from reagents that interfere with DNA replication and/or compromise the checkpoint control mechanism (Admire et al. 2006; Casper et al. 2009; Casper et al. 2008; Cha and Kleckner 2002; Lemoine et al. 2005; Raveendranathan et al. 2006). The unifying hypothesis for the observed chromosome fragility is that replication stress causes the destabilization or \xe2\x80\x9ccollapse\xe2\x80\x9d of the replication forks at specific regions of the chromosomes where fragility occurs. The corollary to this hypothesis is that breakage at CFSs is correlated with altered replication fork progression under the stress conditions. However, direct evidence for a correlation between chromosome breakage and replication fork progression is still absent. Previously, we reported that when checkpoint-deficient mec1-1 cells are exposed to HU at the beginning of S phase, ssDNA accumulates at the replication forks that arise from origin activation (Feng et al. 2009). Moreover, after the removal of HU, replication forks are incapable of resuming DNA synthesis, and cells suffer extensive chromosome breakage.

Lee at Brandeis University. Cells were grown at 30\xc2\xb0 in synthetic complete medium unless otherwise indicated. Alpha factor was used at 200 nM for bar1 strains and 3 \xce\xbcM for BAR1 strains. Pronase was used at 25 \xce\xbcg/ml and 300 \xce\xbcg/ml for bar1 and BAR1 strains, respectively, to remove alpha factor from the culture medium. HU was added at 200 mM. CHEF gel analysis was performed as described previously (Van Brabant et al. 2001). Electrophoresis was conducted at 14\xc2\xb0 for 26 hr with a switch time ramped from 60 to 120 sec at 200 volts. Standard procedures were used to ethidium bromide stain and photograph the gel. Approximately 5 \xc3\x97 108 cells were collected for each sample during the time course of HU exposure and subsequent recovery. The cells were then embedded in agarose plugs and spheroplasted using the same procedures as in the CHEF gel electrophoresis analysis. The agarose plugs were pre-equilibrated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA (5 ml per plug) for 30 min, followed by equilibration in 5 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM \xce\xb2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at room temperature. For each sliver of agarose plug containing 108 cells in approximately 50 \xce\xbcl, 50 \xce\xbcl of labeling mix [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8); 5 mM MgCl2; 10 mM \xce\xb2-mercaptoethanol; 0.24 mM of each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP; 0.12 mM of dTTP; 0.12 mM Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP; 250 \xce\xbcg/ml random hexamers; and 150 units of Klenow (exonuclease deficient, New England Biolab)] were added atop the plug, and the plug was incubated at 37\xc2\xb0 in the dark for 2 hr. The embedded labeled DNA was then electroeluted from the agarose plug in Spectra/Por dialysis tubing (Spectrum) with a 12,000-14,000 MWCO in 0.5\xc3\x97 TBE at 110 volts at room temperature in the dark for 3 hr. The eluted DNA was then sonicated using a BioRuptor (Diagenode) to reduce the average size to 500 bp and purified using the Qiagen PCR Cleanup Kit. The resulting DNAs from a control and an experimental sample, which were differentially labeled with Cy-dUTP, were mixed together and readied for microarray analysis. Sample preparation prior to labeling was performed as described above for the in-gel ssDNA labeling. Restriction digestion of DNA in agarose plugs was performed as described previously (Feng et al. 2009). After the agarose plugs were pre-equilibrated in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1 mM EDTA, they were equilibrated in 1\xc3\x97 End-Repair buffer [Epicentre, 33 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.8), 66 mM KAc, 10 mM MgAc2, and 5 mM dithiothreitol] at 5 ml/plug for 30 min at room temperature. For each sliver of agarose plug containing 108 cells in approximately 50 \xce\xbcl, 50 \xce\xbcl of End-Repair labeling mix (1\xc3\x97 End-Repair buffer; 1 mM ATP; 0.24 mM of each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP; 0.12 mM of dTTP; 0.12 mM Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP; and 3 \xce\xbcl of End-Repair enzyme mix) were added, and the plug was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 hr. Electroelution and subsequent analyses were performed identically as described above. The experimental and control DNA samples were mixed for cohybridization to the Agilent G4493A yeast 4x44K ChIP to chip DNA microarrays according to the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations. Data extraction was performed using Agilent\xe2\x80\x99s Feature Extraction software. After removing those array spots flagged by the software as anomalous, the ratio of background-subtracted fluorescent signals from the experimental to the control sample was calculated for each probe. The resulting ratios for all the probe locations on each chromosome were normalized to the total amount of signals in each fluorescent channel and smoothed with a 6 kb window using a Lowess smoothing algorithm as previously described (Feng et al. 2009). The \xe2\x80\x9cchromosome breakage profile\xe2\x80\x9d was generated by plotting the smoothed ratios against chromosome coordinates. Identification of peaks in the profiles was performed as previously described (Feng et al. 2009). The ssDNA and chromosome breakage mapping in mec1 cells were each performed three times and twice, respectively, with reproducible profiles. The BamHI, FspI, and HO cleavage experiments were performed only once. The significant chromosome breakage sites in mec1 cells after 1 h recovery from exposure to HU obtained from two independent experiments and origin locations used for statistical tests are reported (supporting information, Table S1). All data files for raw ratios of ssDNA or breakage are available in File S1. To test for an association between break sites and chromosomal features within 6 kb, the distance between each break site and its nearest chromosomal feature of interest was first established. Distances between breaks and chromosomal features were measured from midpoint to midpoint. Breaks with chromosomal features within 6 kb were counted. The null distribution of the number of breaks with a given chromosomal feature within 6 kb was determined by randomizing the location of break sites and determining the distance between these random breaks and the chromosomal features. Break sites were randomized by randomly selecting an equal number of positions on the microarray. Ten thousand simulations were run, and in each run, the number of random breaks with a given chromosomal feature within 6 kb was recorded. P values were obtained from the upper tail of the null distribution in which the number of breaks with a chromosomal feature within 6 kb was greater than or equal to that seen for the actual set of breaks. The list of Rad53-checked and unchecked origins used in these analyses were obtained from the previous study (Feng et al. 2006). What regions of the mec1 chromosomes are most susceptible to breakage in the presence of HU and during recovery from HU? Because we previously observed that extensive ssDNA formed at the replication forks in mec1 cells exposed to HU and that the forks were incapable of resuming synthesis after HU removal, we wondered whether the ssDNA at the replication forks would persist and become sites of DSBs. We tested for persistence of ssDNA in mec1 cells following a transient exposure to HU. We synchronized mec1 cells in G1 with the mating pheromone alpha factor, followed by release into S phase in the presence of 200 mM HU, and then collected samples at the beginning (0 hr) and after 1 hr (HU 1hr). We then filtered the cell culture, allowed the cells to \xe2\x80\x9crecover\xe2\x80\x9d in fresh medium without HU, and collected samples after 1 hr (R 1hr). We have previously described a method based on random-primed labeling without denaturation of genomic template DNA to map ssDNA genome-wide (Feng et al. 2006). We have now modified this procedure (see Materials and Methods) and prepared genomic DNA by embedding cells in agarose plugs followed by spheroplasting (Figure 1A). We then performed ssDNA labeling in gel to minimize ssDNA production in vitro. An \xe2\x80\x9cS phase\xe2\x80\x9d sample, either HU 1hr or R 1hr, was paired with a control \xe2\x80\x9cG1 phase\xe2\x80\x9d sample, and the two samples were differentially labeled with Cy-conjugated dUTPs. Labeled DNA was eluted from the agarose, fragmented, and cohybridized to Agilent microarray slides. The relative amount of ssDNA in the \xe2\x80\x9cS phase\xe2\x80\x9d sample was calculated as the ratio of fluorescent signals from the \xe2\x80\x9cS phase\xe2\x80\x9d sample to that from the \xe2\x80\x9cG1 phase\xe2\x80\x9d sample for each chromosome coordinate. As shown in Figure 1B, ssDNA was detected near origins of replication in the HU 1hr sample (orange profile). The reproducibility of this new in-gel labeling methodology is exemplified by the correlation coefficients for the pair-wise comparisons of microarray data from three independent experiments: 0.91, 0.84, and 0.80. Interestingly, the ssDNA profiles of the R 1hr sample (red profile) and the HU 1hr sample were virtually identical (correlation coefficient = 0.93), indicating that the single-stranded gaps remained unfilled even after HU was removed. To validate this modified method, we also mapped ssDNA in a rad53K227A mutant in HU, which we had previously demonstrated, using the old methodology, to accumulate ssDNA at all known origins (Feng et al. 2006). The two ssDNA profiles were nearly identical with even better resolution attributed to the in-gel labeling method (Figure S1). We were also concerned that the ssDNA labeling we observed might be the result of exonuclease-deficient (exo\xe2\x80\x93) Klenow\xe2\x80\x99s strand displacement synthesis\xe2\x80\x94extending the 3\xe2\x80\xb2-end of a nick in the DNA and displacing the downstream DNA strand\xe2\x80\x94rather than the result of filling ssDNA gaps in the template. Therefore, we tested the labeling with Sequenase (an exo\xe2\x80\x93 T7 DNA polymerase that does not possess the strand displacement activity). The ssDNA profiles produced by Klenow and Sequenase are very similar, thus confirming that in vitro synthesis is labeling ssDNA gaps, not merely nicks, in mec1 cells in HU (Figure S2). (A) Outline of experimental procedures for a modified in-gel ssDNA labeling and identification method. (B) ssDNA persists in mec1 cells recovering from exposure to HU. The ssDNA profiles for mec1-1 cells collected after cells were released from alpha factor arrest and exposed to 200 mM HU for 1 hr (\xe2\x80\x9cssDNA_HU 1hr\xe2\x80\x9d; orange profile) and after recovering from 1 hr exposure in media without HU for another 1 hr (\xe2\x80\x9cssDNA_R 1hr\xe2\x80\x9d; red profile) are shown. The symbols at the top of each graph indicate the locations of replication origins: red squares, checked (late/inefficient) origins and green dots, unchecked (early/efficient) origins (Feng et al. 2006). Chromosome numbers are indicated in Roman numerals. Centromere locations are shown as black dots on the X-axis. The same symbols are used for all remaining chromosome profiles throughout the article. If the ssDNAs that persist after removal of HU contribute to chromosome fragility, then their locations should correspond to sites of breakage. On a genome-wide level, meiotic DSBs have been mapped by two microarray-based methods (Blitzblau et al. 2007; Buhler et al. 2007; Cotta-Ramusino et al. 2005; Robine et al. 2007) and a whole-genome sequencing-based method (Pan et al. 2011). These methods monitor either Spo11 binding (via chromosome immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization or sequencing, ChIP-chip, or ChIP-Seq) or the ssDNA tail left by Spo11 at the DSBs (via benzoyl-napthoyl-DEAE-cellulose ssDNA enrichment). CFSs can also be identified through the detection of phosphorylated \xce\xb3-H2AX, which binds DSBs induced by a variety of conditions (Szilard et al. 2010). However, these methods do not label the terminal DSBs directly and could be prone to false positives. For instance, many Spo11 binding sites are not cleaved. Likewise, it is formally possible that with the ssDNA enrichment method, an internal ssDNA gap that is not associated with the DSB might be falsely identified as a product of DSB processing. It has also been reported that \xce\xb3-H2AX foci were detected in the absence of apparent DSBs (Banath et al. 2004). Moreover, ChIP-chip or ChIP-Seq is not yet amenable to our study because it is unclear which proteins will be stably present at the HU-induced DSBs. Finally, reliably detecting DSBs is confounded by random breaks occurring in vitro during DNA isolation. Therefore, we developed a new and versatile genome-wide DSBs mapping method (Figure 2A). To minimize DSBs generated by in vitro manipulations, we again prepared genomic DNA from yeast cells that were embedded in agarose plugs and processed for cell wall disruption and protein degradation. We then incorporated Cy-conjugated dUTP at DNA ends in gel with the End-It labeling kit (Epicentre), which utilizes both the polymerase and the 3\xe2\x80\xb2-5\xe2\x80\xb2 exonuclease activities of the T4 DNA polymerase and can process DNA with either 3\xe2\x80\xb2 or 5\xe2\x80\xb2 overhangs to generate primarily blunt ends. (The End-It kit also contains polynucleotide kinase, which adds a 5\xe2\x80\xb2-phosphate on the DNA end to facilitate cloning. This feature was not required for our experimental purpose, but it produced no ill effect.) We labeled DNA derived from an equal number of cells from the experimental sample (e.g., R 1hr sample that contains DSBs) and from a control sample (nonreplicating DNA without apparent breaks) differentially with Cy3- and Cy5-conjugated dUTPs. We then eluted the DNA from agarose plugs and, after sonicating the DNA to reduce the average fragment size, cohybridized them to Agilent DNA microarrays. The relative level of DSBs was expressed as the ratio of fluorescence signals from the experimental sample to those from the control. Data smoothing and peak identification were performed as previously described (Feng et al. 2009). Chromosome breakage mapping. (A) Outline of microarray-based genome-wide chromosome breakage mapping. For details, see text. (B) End-labeled profile of Chr III from a control sample (log phase mec1 cells) that contains in vitro\xe2\x80\x93generated BamHI ends. The gray vertical lines indicate positions of BamHI digestion sites predicted from the sequence of the S. cerevisiae reference genome (S288C). Blue arrows indicate potential polymorphic BamHI sites in the yeast strain used in this study.

(D) End-labeled profile of MEC1 cells at \xe2\x80\x9cMEC1_HU 1hr\xe2\x80\x9d (cyan) and \xe2\x80\x9cMEC1_R 1hr\xe2\x80\x9d (blue). We first performed a control experiment to map chromosome breakage in samples containing known DSBs. We prepared DNA embedded in agarose plugs as described above from exponentially growing mec1 cells and digested the DNA in gel with the restriction enzyme BamHI. We then differentially labeled the digested and the undigested control DNA in gel with Cy-conjugated dUTPs and carried out the procedures described above to obtain a \xe2\x80\x9cchromosome breakage profile\xe2\x80\x9d of the cells containing BamHI ends (Figure 2B). The mapped DSBs correlated nearly perfectly with the known BamHI sites in the genome. There were some sites mapped as chromosome breaks that did not correspond to known BamHI sites (Figure 2B, blue arrows), suggesting that they might be polymorphisms in our laboratory strain A364a compared with the sequenced strain S288C. Similar results were obtained when we performed the same experiment using the blunt cutter FspI (Figure S3). However, the end-repair labeling of blunt FspI-digested DNA ends was not as efficient as it was for the sticky ends generated by BamHI. We reasoned that the DSBs generated during the HU challenge are unlikely to be blunt ended and that this is a potential caveat of the method. We also asked whether our method was able to detect in vivo DSBs induced by the HO endonuclease in YSCL004, a strain that contains three irreparable HO cut sites due to the lack of donor sequence (one site each on Chr II, III, and VI). The HO gene was controlled by the galactose-inducible Gal1 promoter. Log phase cells grown in media containing glycerol were split into two cultures. Glucose (Glu) or galactose (Gal) was added to the cultures to repress or induce HO activity, respectively. Both cultures were incubated for 1.5 hr to allow the nucleolytic events to proceed in the Gal culture before the addition of glucose to stop further HO cutting. DNA samples were prepared by spheroplasting after cells were embedded in agarose as described above, differentially end-labeled with Cy-dyes, and cohybridized to the microarray. The relative amount of DSBs in the Gal sample was quantified as the ratio of fluorescent signal from the Gal sample to that from the Glu sample. We detected all three HO cut sites as regions that are enriched for end-labeled signals in the Gal sample (Figure S4). Finally, we performed another control experiment to assess how specific the end-repair reaction is for the DNA ends vs. internal stretches of ssDNA that are not associated with DSBs. Our previous observations indicated that chromosomes did not break in mec1 cells during HU exposure but that they did contain extensive ssDNA (Figure 1B). If an internal ssDNA stretch were to contain an adjacent free 3\xe2\x80\xb2-OH group, it would be a suitable primer for the T4 DNA polymerase and skew the results of breakage mapping. As shown in Figure 2C (light-blue profile), the HU 1hr sample exhibited a rather flat breakage profile and did not show significant signals at the ssDNA regions near the origins. This observation suggests that the end-repair reaction does not label internal stretches of ssDNA efficiently and/or that the ssDNA gaps in the HU-treated mec1 cells do not contain free 3\xe2\x80\xb2-OH groups. We mapped DSBs in the mec1 sample that contained extensive chromosome breakage (R 1hr) shown previously (Feng et al. 2009), and we found specific labeling at multiple sites in the genome (Figure 2C, dark-blue profile). The magnitude of breakage in mec1 cells was comparable to that at the BamHI sites, but it was much lower than at the HO sites, demonstrating that chromosome breakage in the mec1 cells was occurring genome-wide rather than at discrete sites (Feng et al. 2009). To confirm our results, we validated a chromosome breakage site on Chr II at 620 kb by indirect end-labeling (Figure S5). In contrast, the wild type (WT) cells in both the HU 1hr and the R 1hr samples did not exhibit significant levels of chromosome breakage (Figure 2D). At first glance, the sites of breakage in mec1 cells recovering from HU appear to occur at specific locations with no obvious correlation to known origins or other landmarks. However, when origins were parsed into the categories of \xe2\x80\x9cearly/efficient\xe2\x80\x9d (origins that fire in HU in the presence of an activated checkpoint; unchecked origins) or \xe2\x80\x9clate/inefficient\xe2\x80\x9d (origins that are delayed in firing after activation of the checkpoint; checked origins), breakage sites were better correlated with forks that initiated from the checked origins (Figure 2C, red squares) than from the unchecked origins (Figure 2C, green dots). To perform this comparison, we first identified those chromosome positions where significant (above median level) breakage was observed. We then asked what percentage of these chromosome positions are within 6 kb of the nearest origin of replication. We chose a 6 kb cutoff because the Lowess smoothing window size of our microarray data was set at 6 kb. A significantly greater percentage of breakage sites was found near the checked origins (41.6%) than near the unchecked origins (11.7%) (P < 10\xe2\x88\x9215) in a two-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction. To test this correlation more rigorously, we also performed a random simulation test and found that the breakage sites were correlated with the checked origins (P < 0.0001) but not with the unchecked origins (P = 0.1851) within a 6 kb distance. We interpret these results as follows. In the mec1 mutant, all origins fire (Feng et al. 2009); however, it appears that the temporal pattern of origin activation remains, as the ssDNA profiles indicated that replication forks migrated away from the unchecked (early) origins but were still in the vicinity of the checked (late) origins. This result suggests that chromosome breakage is correlated with replication fork progression. Comparison of the breakage profile of the R 1hr sample and the ssDNA profile of the HU 1hr sample (which records the positions of replication forks) reveals significant similarity (correlation coefficient = 0.64; Figure 3). Cell synchrony was reduced for the R 1hr sample (2 hr after release from G1 arrest), which likely contributed to the relatively lower resolution of signals, as two independent breakage profiles of the R 1hr samples showed a correlation coefficient of 0.67. That the regional accumulation of ssDNA in HU occurs before breaks are detected in the recovery phase supports the hypothesis that ssDNA formation precedes the occurrence of chromosome breakage and dictates their location. Thus, the identification of ssDNA in the genome can be used to predict sites of chromosome breakage, an observation that has profound implications for the study of CFSs in the human genome. The end-labeling method also detected strong signals at Ty elements (Figure 3, Chr VII and IX, arrows). We entertained the possibility that chromosome breakage is generated at these genomic locations as replication forks progress through the Ty elements, but we found no evidence of breakage at these chromosomal sites by indirect end-labeling of Southern blots (data not shown). Given that Ty3 transposition is cell cycle regulated (Menees and Sandmeyer 1994), we speculate that we may be detecting double-stranded DNA templates arising from cDNA synthesis and replication of Ty elements. Because Ty elements are repetitive, we could not determine with certainty where they map to in the genome using the array-based method. Correlation of sites of breakage with ssDNA formation. The chromosome breakage profile of sample \xe2\x80\x9cR 1 hr\xe2\x80\x9d (blue) resembles the ssDNA profile detected in sample \xe2\x80\x9cHU 1 hr\xe2\x80\x9d (orange). Profiles for Chr II, VI, VII (left) and IX (right) are shown. The positions of Ty elements are indicated by blue arrows; the category of Ty element is indicated by a label above each peak. We have demonstrated that the locations of chromosome breakage are correlated with ssDNA production at stalled replication forks, providing the first direct evidence that collapsed replication forks lead to DSBs. However, as many of the collapsed forks in HU occur near checked (late/inefficient) origins of replication, it is formally possible that this correlation of chromosome breakage with forks is unique to this specific subset of origins of replication rather than to the process of fork progression itself. To subject our hypothesis to a more rigorous test, we allowed replication forks to travel greater distances from the origins before HU treatment and then measured the sites of chromosome breakage in samples recovering from HU (Figure 4A). If it were the ssDNA at forks that contributed to chromosome fragility rather than late/inefficient origins per se, then the break sites should now be found at varying distances from these origins. Chromosome breakage is correlated with replication fork progression. (A) Schematic representation of the scenarios of replication fork progression and the resulting ssDNA profiles in samples that were released into S phase in the presence of HU at different times. The nomenclature of samples is described in the main text. (B) Experimental scheme: mec1 cells were released from alpha factor arrest into medium containing HU at the indicated times. The cells were exposed to HU for 1 hr followed by recovery in fresh medium without HU for 1 hr. For details, see text. (C) CHEF gel electrophoresis of samples from panel B.

(D\xe2\x80\x93F) The left portion of Chr IV is shown in each profile. The experimental scheme is illustrated in Figure 4B. After synchronizing mec1 cells at the G1/S boundary with alpha factor, we split the cell culture into five aliquots. We released the cells into S phase by pronase addition and added 200 mM HU at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after the release to the five aliquots denoted as T0, T5, T10, T15, and T20, respectively. We exposed each cell culture to HU for 1 hr before collecting the samples. We then washed the cells and transferred them into fresh medium without HU to let them \xe2\x80\x9crecover\xe2\x80\x9d for 1 hr. For clarity, we refer to the samples by their aliquot number followed by the description of the treatment they received: \xe2\x80\x9cT#\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the elapsed time (in minutes) after alpha factor removal and before HU addition; \xe2\x80\x9cHU\xe2\x80\x9d for a 1 hr exposure to HU; and \xe2\x80\x9cR\xe2\x80\x9d for a 1 hr recovery from HU. Thus, T5-HU designates the sample in which HU was added at 5 min after the release to S phase and which had been exposed to HU for 1 hr. Likewise, T20-R designates the sample in which HU was added at 20 min after release to the S phase, incubated for 1 hr in HU, and then allowed to recover for 1 hr after HU was removed. DNA was prepared from each sample and subjected to contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) gel electrophoresis as previously described (Feng et al. 2009). As cells enter S phase, linear chromosomes became depleted from the gel as the branched replicating chromosomes were trapped in the well (most obviously seen for the large chromosomes in T20; Figure 4C, lane 5). This property was even more striking for the HU-treated samples (lanes 6-10) where replication forks were slowed. The reappearance of the large chromosomes in the T20-HU sample (lane 10) suggests that many cells were able to complete replication when HU was added at this late time in S phase. However, regardless of when the cells encountered HU, they all exhibited chromosome breakage during recovery (lanes 11-15). We then tested the correlation between fork progression and chromosome breakage: if forks had proceeded away from the origins, we would expect the sites of ssDNA to reflect this fork migration and, more importantly, the breakage sites to be different. We mapped chromosome breakage in the T20-R sample in which replication forks migrated the farthest, and then we mapped chromosome breakage in the control sample T0-R. As shown in Figure 4D, the two breakage profiles were indeed different (correlation coefficient = 0.17). Chromosome breakage at early replicating regions was reduced (Figure 4D, coordinates 400-500 kb) and more broadly distributed in the regions replicated by forks from unchecked origins. To quantify the changes in breakage patterns, we again identified those chromosome positions where significant (above median level) breakage was observed. We then asked whether the break sites were correlated with origin locations within a 6 kb distance in the random simulation test. As was consistent with previous observations, neither the T0-R nor the T20-R sample showed correlation between the breakage sites and the unchecked origins (Table 1). As before, the break sites in the T0-R",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sample were correlated with checked origins (P = 0.0032); however, the break sites in the T20-R sample were not (P = 0.8276; Table 1). These observations indicate that chromosome breakage is less well correlated with origin locations when replication forks have sufficient nucleotides and time to move into flanking regions. Finally, we also monitored replication fork progression by ssDNA mapping in the T0-HU and T20-HU samples. Our results once again showed that the ssDNA profiles of the samples in HU prior to the occurrence of breakage were very similar to the breakage profiles (Figure 4E, F). The correlation coefficient between the T0-HU ssDNA and T0-R breakage profiles was 0.74 and that between the T20-HU ssDNA and T20-R breakage profiles was 0.65. Note that there was a negative, albeit weak, correlation (coefficient = -0.25) between the T0-HU ssDNA and T20-R breakage profiles, suggesting that the origin-proximal regions were protected from chromosome breakage if the forks were allowed to migrate away from them before encountering HU. Thus, our analyses demonstrated that (1) chromosome breakage is correlated with replication fork progression; (2) ssDNA formation is detected prior to chromosome breakage; and (3) sites of ssDNA formation predict the sites of chromosome breakage. On the basis of our results, we postulated that ssDNA formation as a result of replication stress is a common precursor to DSBs. We tested this hypothesis by asking whether we could detect ssDNA at other replication stress\xe2\x80\x93induced chromosome breakage sites prior to breakage taking place. It was reported that a temperature-sensitive mec1-4 mutant has defective replication fork progression at the restrictive temperature, without external challenge by HU, and experiences chromosome breakage later in the cell cycle (Cha and Kleckner 2002). The breakage occurred at regions of the genome described as \xe2\x80\x9creplication slow zones\xe2\x80\x9d (RSZ), which are primarily replication termination sites. We set out to determine whether and when ssDNA formation is detected in the RSZs. We mapped ssDNA in mec1-4 as well as MEC1 cells in mid\xe2\x80\x93S phase (40 min after release from the G1 arrest). As shown in Figure 5, MEC1 cells showed a background level of ssDNA, indicating that replication forks were not stalled at specific regions of the genome. In contrast, the mec1-4 cells showed distinct patterns of elevated levels of ssDNA near the replication termini, the very regions where chromosome breakage was shown to take place (Cha and Kleckner 2002). Although chromosome breakage was not observed until 4 to 6 hr after cells were released from G1, ssDNA was observed after only 40 min. ssDNA predicts sites of eventual chromosome breakage in a mec1-4ts mutant. MEC1 or mec1-4ts cells were released from alpha factor arrest to enter S phase at the restrictive temperature (37\xc2\xb0), and samples were collected after 40 min. Plotted are ssDNA profiles of the MEC1 control sample (blue) and the mec1-4ts sample (orange). The light-gray shaded boxes are replication termination regions that show elevated levels of ssDNA in the mec1-4ts sample. We have developed a genome-wide chromosome breakage mapping method and used it to identify chromosome breakage in checkpoint-deficient mec1-1 cells after exposure to and recovery from HU. It is a versatile method that can be applied to any system in which persistent DSBs are generated. We demonstrated that chromosome breakage is correlated with replication fork progression, providing direct evidence that chromosome fragility results from destabilization of the replication forks in the absence of the checkpoint when the nucleotide pool is reduced/depleted. Our study also demonstrated that prior to the occurrence of chromosome breakage, ssDNA could be detected at the sites of breakage. We thus hypothesized that ssDNA formation is a common precursor to chromosome fragility during replication stress. Using a mec1-4 temperature-sensitive allele that exhibits chromosome fragility without external replication stress, we showed that ssDNA was indeed detectable at the sites of eventual chromosome breakage, lending additional support to our hypothesis. Our data provide a conceptual model where different forms of replication stress, despite having presumably different targets at the replication fork, cause cells to generate ssDNA at the fork as a consequence of either uncoupled synthesis on the two DNA templates or nucleolytic processing of synthesized DNA. We are currently determining the mechanisms of ssDNA formation during different replication stresses. We suggest that the detection of ssDNA can be used as a tool to identify sites of chromosome fragility and may signal when particular replication forks encounter impediments and/or become unstable.

2,"['James B. Holland', 'Nathan D. Coles']","October 4, 2011.",QTL Controlling Masculinization of Ear Tips in a Maize (Zea mays L.) Intraspecific Cross,"b'Maize is unique among cereal grasses because of its monoecious flowering habit. Male flowers are normally restricted to the tassel that terminates the primary shoot, whereas female flowers occur as ears at the terminal nodes of lateral branches. We observed Ki14, a tropical maize inbred that produces an ear tipped by a staminate (male) spike under certain environmental conditions, such as long daylengths. Recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross between temperate line B97, which was never observed to produce a staminate ear tip, and Ki14 segregated for the trait under long daylengths. Some progeny lines that had even longer staminate tips than Ki14 were male fertile. We mapped three QTL controlling staminate ear tip using a two-part (binomial plus normal) model. A major QTL on chromosome 3 had a large effect on penetrance of the trait (whether a line would produce staminate ear tips or not) as well as its severity (the length of the staminate tip). This QTL seems to be linked to, but at a distinct position from, a previously mapped QTL controlling the proportion of staminate florets in ears in progeny from crosses between maize and teosinte. Two additional QTL affecting staminate ear tip severity overlapped with QTL controlling photoperiod response previously mapped in this population. Alleles conferring photoperiod sensitivity for delayed flowering at these QTL seem to enhance the production of staminate ear tips under long daylengths.Maize (Zea mays L. subsp. mays) is monoecious, with staminate (male) flowers located at the tip of the primary shoot in a structure referred to as the tassel and pistillate (female) flowers located at the tip of one or more lateral branches in the ear. The restriction of male flowers to the tassel occurs due to the abortion of pistils in the florets in the early development of the tassel; similarly, stamens are aborted during the development of ears (Irish 1996). Unusual environmental conditions or mutations at a few key developmental loci can result in feminization of the tassel or masculinization of the ear (Chuck et al. 2007; Dellaporta and Calderon-Urrea 1994; Emerson and Emerson 1922; Heslop-Harrison 1961; Iltis 1983; Irish 1996). Teosinte (Zea mays L. subsp. parviglumis), the closest relative and presumed ancestor of maize, has a distinct growth habit and ear morphology compared with maize (Iltis 1983; Doebley 2004). Teosinte has numerous long lateral branches, which bear ears at intermediate nodes and tassels at the terminal node; in contrast, maize has very short lateral branches (compressed into a shank) that terminate in a female ear (Doebley 2004; Iltis 1983; Mangelsdorf 1974). Doebley and colleagues (Doebley 2004; Doebley and Stec 1991; Doebley and Stec 1993; Doebley et al. 1995) mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) conditioning the key morphological differences between maize and teosinte and identified two of the underlying genes, tb1 and tga1 (Clark et al. 2006; Doebley et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2005). tb1 has a major effect on the lateral branching pattern and inflorescence placement in segregating populations derived from crosses between maize and teosinte. Another QTL on chromosome 3L also has a major effect on these and other domestication traits, but its effect disappears in predominantly maize genetic backgrounds due to epistatic interaction with tb1 (Doebley 2004; Doebley et al. 1995). Plasticity for sexual determination of florets in ears exists in some maize varieties (Mangelsdorf 1974). We previously reported remarkable plasticity for vegetative and sexual organ determination in the tropical maize inbred line Ki14 grown under long daylengths in a controlled environment condition (Figure S4 in Coles et al. 2010). In addition, we observed that Ki14 often produced a spike of staminate florets at the tips of its ears when grown under long daylengths in field environments. Under short daylengths, this abnormality was not observed. Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross of temperate line B97 and Ki14 that were used to study the inheritance of photoperiod sensitivity also segregated for the staminate ear tip trait under long daylengths, and we were able to score these lines for this phenotype in one long daylength environment, permitting mapping of QTL affecting this trait. The objectives of this study were to map QTL controlling staminate ear tips in this maize population. Determination of QTL positions allows us to address the hypothesis that the gene(s) controlling this trait are known mutants of sex determination in maize (e.g., anther ear 1) or represent standing variation for domestication traits remaining in maize after the domestication bottleneck and more than 5000 years of selection for fully pistillate ears.'","b'Maize is unique among cereal grasses because of its monoecious flowering habit.

From the cross of B97 and Ki14, we derived F5:6 or F6:7 RILs, whereby each RIL was derived from a unique F2 plant. Selfing generations alternated between long-day summer nurseries in Clayton, NC, and short-day winter nurseries in Homestead, FL. RIL seed was increased via sib mating and bulking of up to 20 plants per line; this bulked seed was then used in the experiment. We evaluated 217 RILs from this cross, plus the parental lines B97 and Ki14 and the check inbred line B73, in three long daylength and three short daylength environments (Coles et al. 2010). The staminate ear tip trait was consistently observed only in the long daylength environment of summer season 2006 in Clayton, NC. In that environment, we employed an 11 \xc3\x97 20 alpha lattice design with two complete replications. The design was augmented by including B73 as an additional check within each incomplete block to help control spatial variation, resulting in 480 plots. Each plot consisted of 12 plants sown in a 1.8-m row with 0.6-m alleys between the front and back of each row and 1-m spacing on either side of each row. Each plot was given a single rating of 0\xe2\x80\x934 based on the median extent of masculinization of ear tips: 0, normal ear with no staminate florets; 1, ear with a very small tassel-like formation at the tip; 2, ear tipped by a substantial staminate tassel\xe2\x80\x93like formation that did not extend outside of the husk; 3, ear tipped by a staminate tassel\xe2\x80\x93like formation long enough to extend outside of the husk; 4, ear tipped by a staminate tassel spike that extended out of the husk and had anthers that shed pollen. Raw phenotypic data are provided in Table S1. Data from the RIL populations were analyzed using SAS version 9.1.3 Proc Mixed (SAS Institute Inc. 2002\xe2\x80\x932008). An initial analysis was performed in which incomplete blocks that showed no evidence of significant variation in the models examined were eliminated from the model. The resulting model was used to compute RIL and parental line least square means for QTL mapping: Yij\xe2\x80\x89= \xce\xbc + Ri + Gj + \xe2\x88\x88ij, where \xce\xbc is the overall mean, Ri is the effect of the ith complete replication, Gj is the effect of the jth RIL or check line genotype, and \xe2\x88\x88ij is the residual error effect for the jth genotype in the ith replication. In this model, RIL lines were considered fixed and replications considered random. We observed that residual values were not independent of predicted values from this model, because the variation among residual values maximum at predicted scores near two and minimum at predicted scores near zero or four. Natural log and square root transformations did not ameliorate this problem; therefore, we analyzed untransformed data. Estimated RIL means are in Table S2. The variation among RILs was used to estimate heritability (Holland et al. 2003) and was estimated separately from parental variation with a modification of the previous model, treating RIL effect as a random variable (Piepho et al. 2006). Genomic DNA was extracted from the bulked leaf tissue of 10 plants representing each of the RILs using the Invitrogen Charge Switch Genomic DNA Extraction kit (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). We used simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (Lawrence et al. 2007), SNP markers from the Panzea project (www.panzea.org; Zhao et al. 2006), and PCR-based photoperiod response candidate gene markers to define linkage groups (Coles et al. 2010). SSR and candidate gene markers were genotyped using gel electrophoresis on Agarose SFR (Amresco Incorporated, Solon, OH). A total of 1536 SNP markers were genotyped using the Illumina Golden Gate SNP genotyping assay (Yan et al. 2009). Four candidate gene markers and 79 SSR markers were polymorphic in the B97\xc3\x97Ki14 population and were assayed on all RILs. Because of limited resources, only a subset of the 15 earliest flowering, 15 latest flowering, and a random sample of 98 RILs from the B97\xc3\x97Ki14 population were genotyped with the 1536 SNPs, of which 476 were polymorphic and reliably segregating in this population. After removing 3 RILs that seemed to be contaminated and 3 RILs that did not produce ears, we had phenotypic and genotypic data on 211 RILs. Data are included in Table S2. We mapped QTL for the staminate ear tip phenotype using the consensus linkage map for four populations (including B97\xc3\x97Ki14) created by Coles et al. (2010) because this map is based on a very large sample size and is more reliable than the individual population map. We mapped QTL using R/QTL software (Broman et al. 2003). The R/QTL script used is included as supporting information (File S1). Because the distribution of genotype mean values exhibited a substantial peak at zero (Figure 1), we employed the two-part binary plus normal analysis method (Broman and Sen 2009). This models the phenotype in two parts: it analyzes lines with trait values above zero using a normal phenotype model and separately analyzes the trait across all lines as a binary trait (0 or >0). The two-part model produces three LOD scores for each genomic position tested: one for the hypothesis that a QTL at that position increases the probability that the phenotype score is greater than zero; one for the hypothesis that a QTL at that position changes the mean phenotype score among lines that have a nonzero phenotype; and a third LOD score that is the sum of the scores for the individual parts of the model (Broman and Sen 2009). Histogram representing the distribution of mean staminate ear tip score among RILs derived from the cross of B97 and Ki14. RIL, recombinant inbred line. We used 1000 permutations to identify genome-wide thresholds for declaring the presence of a QTL (Doerge and Churchill 1996). After identifying QTL with the two-part model, we estimated QTL effects and associated variation for both the two-part model and a standard normal model. The normal model was fit using 128 simulated genotype draws to account for missing data and interval positions between markers (Broman and Sen 2009). Approximate 95% Bayes credible intervals were estimated by rescaling the LOD scores from the initial QTL scan of a chromosome to a distribution and identifying the interval that contained 95% of the LOD distribution (Broman and Sen 2009). To further investigate the effect of trait scale on QTL detection, we transformed the original scores into four different binary scales, where RILs were classified as zero if their mean score \xe2\x89\xa4 0, 1, 2, or 3; otherwise, RILs were classified as one. In each case, we used a genome scan with a binary model version of the Haley-Knott method and identified significant QTL as those with LOD scores > 3.0. Neither parental line B97 nor temperate check inbred line B73 was observed to have any staminate florets in the ear, but tropical parental line Ki14 had a score of two in both replications. The distribution of the staminate ear tip phenotype in the RIL population was distinctly non-normal, with most lines having a phenotype score of zero (no staminate florets in the ear; Figure 1). The estimate of heritability on a line mean basis was 89% (approximate standard error = 2%). Although the asymmetrical distribution and heterogeneous residual variation of the trait scale violate some assumptions of heritability estimation, the high value indicates that staminate ear tip was scored reliably in this environment. Of the 211 RILs evaluated, 28 (13%) had staminate ear tip scores greater than Ki14. Five RILs had mean scores of four, indicating that their ears had staminate tassel spikes protruding from the husks and shedding pollen. At the genome-wise \xce\xb1 = 0.05 threshold, we detected two QTL with the two-part model (Figure 2). The QTL with largest effect was on chromosome 3L, with a peak at marker PZA02402.1 (133 cM on the combined genetic map, 172 Mbp on the B73 RefGen_v2 chromosome 3 sequence; Maize Genetics and Genomics Database). This position had a large effect on ear tip masculinization when the scores were treated as binomial (0 vs. >0), indicating that that Ki14 alleles at this QTL increase the probability that a line will express masculinized ear tips. This observation may be interpreted as a QTL affecting the penetrance of the staminate ear tip. LOD scores from full genome scan across 10 chromosome pairs of maize using two-part model for staminate ear tip score. Black curve represents total two-part model LOD score, blue curve represents LOD score for penetrance, and red curve represents LOD score for severity at each genome position. Dashed horizontal lines represent genome-wise \xce\xb1 = 0.10 LOD threshold, and solid horizontal lines represent genome-wise \xce\xb1 = 0.05 LOD threshold for declaring a significant QTL based on 1000 permutations. A second QTL was identified on chromosome 9, near marker PZ02648.8 (87.5 cM on the combined map and 26\xe2\x80\x9333 Mbp on the B73 RefGen_v2 chromosome 9 sequence). This QTL only affected the severity of the trait, among those lines that expressed staminate florets. A third QTL was identified on chromosome 10, just below the \xce\xb1 =\xe2\x80\x890.05 genome-wise threshold and significant at the \xce\xb1 =\xe2\x80\x890.10 genome-wise threshold for the joint two-part model LOD score. This QTL was located near marker PZA00647.9 (78.3 cM on the combined map, 127 to 128 Mbp on the B73 RefGen_v2 chromosome 10 sequence). The chromosome 3 QTL was associated with 15% of the variation for staminate ear spike treated as a binary character and with 12% of the variation for the score on the original scale (Table 1). The QTL on chromosomes 9 and 10 each were associated with about 5% of the variation individually for variation in the original score scale. The three QTL combined were associated with 29% of the variation for the original score variation (Table 1). Tests for epistasis among these three QTL indicated that there was no significant epistatic variation. Genome scans of alternate binary classifications revealed that the chromosome 3 QTL was significant (LOD > 3.0) for all cases, except for the classification into \xe2\x89\xa43.0 vs. >3.0 groups. The chromosome 9 QTL was significant for classification into \xe2\x89\xa41.0 vs. >1.0, the chromosome 10 QTL was significant for classification into \xe2\x89\xa42.0 vs. >2.0, and both chromosome 9 and 10 QTL were significant for classification into \xe2\x89\xa43.0 vs. >3.0 group. These results are congruent with the chromosome 3 QTL acting as the primary determinant of masculinization of ear tips and the chromosomes 9 and 10 QTL acting as minor effect QTL that increase the expression of the trait. Inspection of the three-locus genotype values reveals that most, but not all, RILs homozygous for B97 alleles at all three QTL positions had scores of zero (Figure 3). A few of those RILs had mean scores up to 1.5, however. RILs homozygous for Ki14 alleles at all three loci had a mean score of about two, equal to Ki14 itself. This three-locus model cannot explain the transgressive RIL segregants with scores up to four; perhaps B97 alleles at QTL with small effects that were not detected promote higher scores in combination with Ki14 alleles at the three major QTL loci. Indeed, the LOD peak observed on chromosome 7 (Figure 2), which was below the threshold for declaring a significant QTL, had a small (2%) effect on variation when fit in a model with the other three QTL, but it was unusual in that the B97 alleles at this region increased staminate ear tip score (Figure S1). Three-locus genotype values for staminate ear tip score for RILs with complete genotype scores at markers at peak of three QTL. Y-axis is mean staminate ear tip score for each RIL, and X-axis indicates two-allele genotypes at each of three markers. Genotype classes at the marker closest to the LOD peak of the three QTL (PZA02402.1 on chromosome 3, PZA02648.2 on chromosome 9, and PZA00647.9 on chromosome 10) are given as \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d for lines homozygous B97 allele and \xe2\x80\x9cK\xe2\x80\x9d for lines homozygous for the Ki14 allele.

Emerson and Emerson (1922) described the anther ear (an1) mutation that results in staminate ear tips, which we observed in the B97\xc3\x97Ki14 RIL population. The an1 mutation, however, also produces stamens throughout the ear, including in florets that produce seeds (Emerson and Emerson 1922). Furthermore, an1 and its paralog an2 map to chromosome 1, where no QTL for staminate ear tip was found. Therefore, we conclude that the genes controlling staminate ear tip in this population are distinct from an1 and an2. We found a strong QTL for the staminate ear tip phenotype on chromosome 3 in a region where several floral development genes have previously been mapped, including terminal ear1 (te1) and tassel seed4 (ts4) (Chuck et al. 2007; Veit et al. 1998). The phenotypic effects of known mutations at these genes are distinct from the staminate ear tip phenotype we observed in this population, however. te1 and ts4 may produce feminized tassels rather than masculinized ears, and they affect leaf initiation and meristem branching in ways not observed in this study. The 95% Bayes credible interval containing this QTL corresponds to positions 171.4 to 176.3 Mbp on the B73 RefGen_V2 sequence. te1 is located at 165.1 Mbp and ts4 is at 136 Mbp, outside of the QTL interval. A similar region of chromosome 3 was shown to have a strong effect on the fraction of primary lateral inflorescence spikelets that were male in multiple crosses between maize and teosinte (Briggs et al. 2007; Doebley and Stec 1991; Doebley and Stec 1993; Doebley et al. 1995). However, these teosinte QTL intervals end near a marker located at 163 Mbp on chromosome 3, just before the start of the approximate 95% Bayes credible interval of the staminate ear tip QTL on chromosome 3. Therefore, we have evidence that the staminate ear tip QTL segregating in maize is linked to, but distinct from, a major QTL controlling proportion of staminate florets in the terminal lateral inflorescence in maize-teosinte hybrid populations. Imprecision in QTL location due to environmental and experimental error affecting phenotypic scoring and a 10-cM gap in our map immediately adjacent to the proximal side of our QTL interval prevent drawing a definite conclusion about the relationship between the chromosome 3 QTL mapped in this study and that mapped previously by Doebley and colleagues (Briggs et al. 2007; Doebley et al. 1995). The smaller effect QTL for staminate ear tip that we identified on chromosomes 9 and 10 did not overlap previously identified domestication QTL or known floral sex determination genes. However, the 95% Bayes credible support intervals for both of these regions overlapped QTL identified for photoperiod response for silking date and other developmental traits (ZmPR3 and ZmPR4) in this population by Coles et al. (2010). Staminate ear tips were observed in this population only under long daylengths. The overlap of QTL for photoperiod response and staminate ear tips suggests that staminate ear tips may be produced as a result of photoperiod-induced flowering delay specifically in genotypes most sensitive to photoperiod under long daylengths.

One way to elucidate the evolutionary forces acting on these traits is to detail the genetic architecture of variation both within and between species, a program of research that is considerably more tractable in a model system. Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species, D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia, are morphologically distinguishable only by the shape of the posterior lobe, a male-specific elaboration of the genital arch. We extend earlier studies identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for lobe divergence across species and report the first genetic dissection of lobe shape variation within a species. Using an advanced intercross mapping design, we identify three autosomal QTL contributing to the difference in lobe shape between a pair of D. melanogaster inbred lines. The QTL each contribute 4.6\xe2\x80\x9310.7% to shape variation, and two show a significant epistatic interaction. Interestingly, these intraspecific QTL map to the same locations as interspecific lobe QTL, implying some shared genetic control of the trait within and between species. As a first step toward a mechanistic understanding of natural lobe shape variation, we find an association between our QTL data and a set of genes that show sex-biased expression in the developing genital imaginal disc (the precursor of the adult genitalia). These genes are good candidates to harbor naturally segregating polymorphisms contributing to posterior lobe shape.There is a great deal of interest in characterizing the morphological and behavioral changes that distinguish closely related species to understand the evolutionary processes involved in the early stages of speciation. In this context, the male genitalia of insects have come under particular scrutiny due to the observation that genital morphology is often species specific and can show striking diversity across related taxa that are otherwise similar in form (Eberhard 1985). Various lines of evidence point to sexual selection as a likely driver of this rapid divergence in genital morphology (Eberhard 1985, 2010; Hosken and Stockley 2004). Although the precise mechanism of sexual selection is debated, a popular hypothesis is cryptic female choice (Eberhard et al. 1998; Eberhard 2010). Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that variation in male fertilization success is linked to morphological variation in male genital structures (e.g., Arnqvist and Danielsson 1999; Danielsson and Askenmo 1999; reviewed by Eberhard 2011). Despite interest in the variation and evolution of male genitalia, few studies have attempted to genetically dissect these traits (however, see Sasabe et al. 2010 and Schafer et al. 2011). Describing the genetic loci responsible for phenotypic variation in terms of their allelic effects, population frequencies, and interactions can provide valuable information about the evolutionary forces acting on a trait (Templeton 1981; Mitchell-Olds et al. 2007). Drosophila melanogaster is one of a handful of elite model genetic systems, and it has been widely employed to characterize the genetic architecture of trait variation (Flint and Mackay 2009; Mackay 2010). Numerous related Drosophilid species can also be reared easily in the laboratory, and recent large-scale sequencing efforts have generated genome sequences for many of them (Clark et al. 2007), increasing their utility as experimental organisms for comparative work. In addition, the three species\xe2\x80\x94D. mauritiana, D. sechellia, and D. simulans\xe2\x80\x94most closely related to D. melanogaster are reproductively interfertile, allowing recombinant individuals to be produced for genetic analysis of traits distinguishing the species. Thus, this species group provides an excellent platform with which to understand the forces that shape phenotypic variation. Interestingly, all four species of the D. melanogaster complex are morphologically very similar except for the shape and size of an elaborate cuticular projection (the posterior lobe) on the male genital arch, a structure that is the only reliable morphological indicator of species identity (Ashburner et al. 2005). The posterior lobe inserts under the ninth abdominal tergite of the female during copulation (Robertson 1988) and is used by the male during mounting and the early stages of mating to maintain strong genital coupling (Jagadeeshan and Singh 2006). Although no formal association has been made between posterior lobe morphology and male mating success, the striking variation across species suggests directional sexual selection acting on the structure. Thus, we have an opportunity to genetically dissect a rapidly evolving, male-specific genital trait using the armamentarium of genetic tools available for the Drosophila experimental system. A number of studies have examined divergence between Drosophila species in posterior lobe morphology using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping techniques. Early work confirmed that interspecific variation for the trait is polygenic, with separate crosses between D. simulans and D. melanogaster, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia all identifying at least one genetic factor contributing to phenotypic variation on each of the three major chromosomes (Coyne 1983; Coyne and Kreitman 1986). Subsequent work using larger panels of recombinants and genome-wide sets of markers identified multiple QTL on each chromosome for the D. simulans \xc3\x97 D. mauritiana cross (Liu et al. 1996; Laurie et al. 1997; Zeng et al. 2000) and the D. simulans \xc3\x97 D. sechellia cross (Macdonald and Goldstein 1999). Collectively, these studies suggest that QTL contributing to posterior lobe divergence between species are numerous, show limited epistasis, and are predominantly additive. Strikingly, additive effects were nearly always in the same direction: substituting a D. simulans allele for a D. mauritiana or a D. sechellia allele at a lobe QTL always gave a more D. simulans\xe2\x80\x93like lobe phenotype. This suggests a consistent history of strong directional selection acting on the trait during species divergence (Orr 1998). Despite the work on interspecific variation in genital morphology between members of the D. melanogaster complex, no study has yet described natural genetic variation for the posterior lobe within any one of these species. If we can characterize the loci that maintain the subtle lobe shape variation within a species, as well as those that influence extreme posterior lobe diversification among species, we can elucidate the relationship between intra- and interspecific genetic variation and develop a detailed understanding of the selective forces operating on the trait. In this study, we survey a series of D. melanogaster inbred lines and find considerable variation in posterior lobe morphology. We then carry out QTL mapping, employing an advanced generation recombinant population to genetically dissect variation between a pair of lines that differ in posterior lobe shape.'","b'The observation that male genitalia diverge more rapidly than other morphological traits during evolution is taxonomically widespread and likely due to some form of sexual selection.

In this study, we survey a series of D. melanogaster inbred lines and find considerable variation in posterior lobe morphology. We then carry out QTL mapping, employing an advanced generation recombinant population to genetically dissect variation between a pair of lines that differ in posterior lobe shape. Fifteen highly inbred, P-element and Wolbachia-free lines were used in this study. Fourteen were obtained from stock centers and were subjected to multiple generations of brother-sister mating prior to this study (see Table 1 of Macdonald and Long 2007). The remaining isogenic line, Samarkand ry506 (hereafter, Sam), which harbors a mutant eye-color allele at the third chromosome rosy locus, was provided by T.F.C. Mackay and is described in Lyman et al. (1996). Unless otherwise stated, all flies were reared at 23\xc2\xb0 under constant light, using 10 ml of cornmeal-molasses-yeast medium in polystyrene vials (25 \xc3\x97 95 mm). For each of the 15 strains, we generated three or four replicate vials, collected males under CO2 anesthesia, and stored them at \xe2\x88\x9220\xc2\xb0 in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes until dissection. An average of 22.8 males were successfully phenotyped per strain (range = 12\xe2\x80\x9342), with a mean of 6.84 per replicate vial. We chose b3852 and Sam, a pair of strains with divergent lobe morphology, and initiated multiple replicate cross-vials with 10 virgin b3852 females and 10 Sam males. Parental flies were removed within 48 hr to maintain a relatively constant low larval density. F1 hybrid progeny were collected and aged in single-sex groups to ensure females were virgin, and then multiple replicate intercross vials holding 10 virgin F1 females and 10 F1 males were set up. Again, flies were removed within 48 hr. Upon maturation, F2 males from each replicate vial were collected and frozen as described above. Reciprocal crosses between b3852 and Sam were carried out in small polypropylene bottles (8 oz, 60 \xc3\x97 130 mm). Approximately 200 F1 individuals from each reciprocal cross were mixed, and the combined population was split into two fresh bottles. In the next generation, F2 flies were combined into a single large glass bottle (64 oz), and this recombinant population was maintained at high census size with 12\xe2\x80\x9313 day generations until the F16 generation eclosed. A large number of replicate vials were each initiated with \xe2\x88\xbc20 F16 individuals, and flies were allowed to lay eggs for 24 hr. F17 males were collected and frozen as described. The terminalia was dissected from each experimental male, individually placed in a 0.2 ml PCR tube containing a drop of 1M KOH, and boiled for 2\xe2\x80\x935 min to dissolve unwanted connective tissue. For recombinant F2 and F17 flies, the remainder of the dissected animal was refrozen for subsequent DNA extraction. The genital arch, including the paired posterior lobes and lateral plates, was then dissected out in 1M KOH and mounted on a microscope slide under a coverslip in a small drop of Aqua-Mount (Lerner #13800 via VWR #41799-008). Slides were left overnight at 40\xe2\x80\x9345\xc2\xb0 on a slide warmer with a \xe2\x88\xbc4 g weight pushing the coverslip down, and the next day a TIFF image of each slide-mounted posterior lobe was captured at 400\xc3\x97 total magnification. The dissection of an experimental individual was considered successful if at least one of the pair of posterior lobes was undamaged. For lobe data to be comparable across genotypes, lobes must be placed in a standard configuration prior to morphometric analysis; i.e., all lobes should have the same handedness, orientation, and relative location. To ensure all lobes were of the same handedness, images were manually flipped such that the lateral plate (and thus the \xe2\x80\x9cpoint\xe2\x80\x9d of the lobe) points clockwise (refer to Figure 3). Each image was then manually outlined in ImageJ (Rasband 1997\xe2\x80\x932011) using a custom macro to automatically record a set of Cartesian coordinates defining each outline. Following previous work on the posterior lobe (Liu et al. 1996; Macdonald and Goldstein 1999; Masly et al. 2011), outlines were closed with an artificial baseline that extends from the point at which the lateral plate connects to the posterior lobe. Outlines from all lobes were subsequently oriented to make these baselines horizontal. Finally, the origin of each set of coordinates was placed at the centroid of the outline to make the locations of all lobe outlines comparable. Due to the lack of reliable morphological landmarks on the posterior lobe, we used elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) to describe outline shape (Kuhl and Giardina 1982; Ferson et al. 1985). We applied EFA using a custom R script (http://www.r-project.org/; R Development Core Team 2010). A detailed description of the methodology as applied to posterior lobe shape is provided in Liu et al. (1996) and Macdonald and Goldstein (1999). Briefly, elliptic Fourier functions use a parametric representation of the x- and y-projections of the outline, treating each independently as a function of contour length. Following EFA, each outline is represented by a set of 4n Fourier coefficients that can reproduce the outline with arbitrary precision depending on the number of harmonics (n). Here we use 25 harmonics, which provides a near-perfect reconstruction of the original outline (see Figure 2 in Liu et al. 1996) and yields 100 coefficients per lobe. Because we had placed the outlines in a standard configuration prior to EFA, in our analyses we did not employ the coefficient normalizing functions described in Kuhl and Giardina (1982). However, we obtained practically identical QTL mapping results for the mPC1 shape measure whether or not we applied these functions (data not shown). In addition, because posterior lobe morphology is largely unaffected by variation in overall body size (Liu et al. 1996; Macdonald and Goldstein 1999; Shingleton et al. 2009; Masly et al. 2011), we did not seek to control for such variation, for instance, by measuring wing area or tibia length. The 100 Fourier coefficients for a subset of experimental individuals were treated as variables in a principal components analysis (PCA) to encapsulate shape variation in a small number of mathematical descriptors. Two separate PCA were carried out using the \xe2\x80\x98prcomp\xe2\x80\x99 R function, one for the species diversity experiment, and one for the mapping experiment. The species diversity PCA consisted of individuals from the set of 15 strains used to examine morphological variation within D. melanogaster. The mapping experiment PCA employed all mapping population flies and their progenitors (b3852, Sam, F1, F2, and F17). We caution that the principal component (PC) shape descriptors may not be comparable across these two analyses; to avoid confusion, we prefixed principal components derived from the species diversity PCA with an \xe2\x80\x9cs\xe2\x80\x9d (e.g., sPC1) and those from the mapping experiment PCA with an \xe2\x80\x9cm\xe2\x80\x9d (e.g., mPC1). Finally, we estimated the size of each lobe as the area enclosed by the outline, lobe height (width) as the length of the vertical (horizontal) line through the centroid, and the height:width ratio (H:W) as the ratio of these two distances. Markers discriminating b3852 and Sam were identified by sequencing a series of 1 kb PCR fragments in both lines. SNPs were submitted to the Illumina GoldenGate assay design tool, and 96 high-scoring SNPs spread along the three major chromosomes were chosen for genotyping in our F2 and F17 mapping panels (File S1). DNA was extracted from each phenotyped recombinant using the Puregene cell and tissue kit (Qiagen), resuspended in 20 \xc2\xb5l of 1X TE, and 10 \xc2\xb5l of diluted DNA was used for genotyping (Illumina BeadXpress platform, UC Davis Genome Center). The resulting raw intensity data were submitted to a custom set of R scripts to call genotypes (see Macdonald et al. 2005), and 87/96 SNPs yielded high-quality genotypes (X = 16, 2L = 22, 2R = 17, 3L = 12, 3R = 20). We also genotyped a single RFLP marker at the eyeless gene on chromosome 4 in the F2 mapping panel. Briefly, we amplified a short PCR fragment containing a diagnostic SNP (eyeF, 5\xe2\x80\xb2-TGT GTG AGC AAA ATT CTC GG-3\xe2\x80\xb2; eyeR, 5\xe2\x80\xb2-GTT TCG GCA TGG TAG GAC AT-3\xe2\x80\xb2), digested with MboII, and genotyped by separating restriction fragments on a 2.5% agarose gel. For the recombinant flies, depending on the quality of the dissected material, phenotypes were scored on either one or both of the posterior lobes. When both lobes were successfully imaged (153/711 or 21.5% of the recombinants) we randomly chose the phenotype from a single lobe for mapping. All QTL mapping analyses and estimation of the genetic map from the marker genotypes were carried out within R/qtl (Broman and Sen 2009). Input files are available (see supporting information, File S2 and File S3). For the F2, both interval mapping (IM; Lander and Botstein 1989) and composite interval mapping (CIM; Zeng 1994) were performed using the multiple imputation method of Sen and Churchill (2001) with 256 imputations. Statistical significance was determined from 1000 permutations (Churchill and Doerge 1994), taking care to generate X- and autosome-specific thresholds (Broman et al. 2006). For the F17 we took a selective genotyping approach to fine-map QTL influencing the mPC1 measure of shape. Of the 344 phenotyped F17 males, the 47 with the lowest, most b3852-like mPC1 score, and the 47 with the highest, most Sam-like mPC1 score were genotyped. To minimize analytical bias associated with selective genotyping, all phenotyped F17 individuals were included in the QTL mapping analysis (IM using multiple imputation), with the genotypes from the nontail individuals recorded as missing (Lander and Botstein 1989; Sen et al. 2005). In addition, a stratified permutation test was carried out, separately permuting phenotypes within the genotyped and ungenotyped subsets of F17 individuals (Manichaikul et al. 2007). The shape and size of the posterior lobe differ among the four members of the melanogaster complex of species (see Figure 1 in Liu et al. 1996). In addition to this dramatic interspecific variation, more subtle intraspecific variation has been noted for D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia (Liu et al. 1996; Macdonald and Goldstein 1999). We extend these surveys of variation to D. melanogaster and score individuals from 15 inbred lines to generate a framework for understanding the basis of lobe shape and size variation in this model genetic system. Variation in posterior lobe shape in D. melanogaster. Lobe outlines from a number of males (one lobe per individual) from 15 inbred lines were subjected to elliptic Fourier analysis, and the resulting coefficients used in a principal components analysis (the species diversity PCA). Considerable variation in shape among strains is shown for the two major principal components, sPC1 and sPC2. Strains in red symbols are those chosen as the parents for QTL mapping. Because the posterior lobe lacks clear morphological landmarks, we quantified size and shape variation using morphometric analyses based on sets of Cartesian coordinates defining lobe outlines. An EFA of each outline results in a series of Fourier coefficients, and a PCA of these values encapsulates variation across individuals in a series of orthogonal descriptors of shape. Figure 1 highlights shape variation along two of these descriptors, sPC1 and sPC2, that together explain >70% of lobe variation in our sample of lines. While PCA provides a convenient small set of mathematical descriptors of shape, their interpretation is difficult due to the sheer complexity of the shape variation across lines (see Figure S1). Nonetheless, careful examination of the point clouds from Figure 1, along with the relevant columns from Table 1, shows clustering of individuals from the same line and clear differences among lines. For instance, lines t7 and b3846 are separated along the sPC1 axis, whereas lines b3870 and t0 are separated along the sPC2 axis. These results show that our morphometric descriptions of shape are robust and allow discrimination of the different lobe shapes found in various genotypes of D. melanogaster. The lines chosen for our survey were collected from sites in 10 different countries and, hence, captured a large swath of the cosmopolitan genetic variation in D. melanogaster. However, because we did not sample multiple genotypes from the same population, we cannot assess relative levels of within- and between-population variation in the posterior lobe. It may be that the extent of posterior lobe variation we describe, perhaps due to some degree of local adaptation, is greater than would be observed within a single population. A more extensive survey of morphological variation, including multiple genotypes from multiple different populations, is needed to address this question. A primary goal of our survey was to identify a pair of morphologically distinct lines that differ along a major axis of intraspecific phenotypic variation for use as the parents for a QTL mapping study. We selected lines b3852 and Sam for this purpose (red symbols in Figure 1). These lines have similar lobe areas, differ strongly in sPC1 (the major axis of shape variation in the diversity panel) but not in sPC2 or sPC3, with b3852 having taller and narrower posterior lobes than Sam (Table 1). Lines b3852 and Sam were intercrossed in separate experiments to generate F2 and F17 males. Posterior lobe outlines from all relevant genotypes (b3852, Sam, F1, F2, and F17) were processed via EFA, and the coefficients were used as variables in a PCA. The top six principal components each explain >1% of the posterior lobe variation among this set of individuals: mPC1 (62.6%), mPC2 (17.1%), mPC3 (12.2%), mPC4 (2.1%), mPC5 (1.8%), and mPC6 (1.2%). In addition, the parental strains are significantly different for each of the first four principal components: mPC1 (t-test, P < 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9229), mPC2, (P < 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x924), mPC3 (P = 0.003), and mPC4 (P < 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927). However, the phenotypic distributions of the parental strains fail to overlap only for mPC1 (Figure 2). mPC1 lobe shape variation in b3852, Sam, F1, and recombinant genotype classes. Each bar shows the mean (\xc2\xb1 SD) of multiple individuals, taking just a single lobe from each fly: b3852 (N = 29), Sam (N = 25), F1 (N = 21), F2 (N = 367), F17 (N = 344), F17 b3852 tail (N = 47), and F17 Sam tail (N = 47). F1 males derived from reciprocal parental crosses have similar shapes and were averaged.

Morphology of the posterior lobe in the progenitors of the QTL mapping panels. On the left, a representative lobe image is presented for the two parental strains and the F1 hybrid (the result of a Sam female \xc3\x97 b3852 male cross). The closed outlines derived from these images used for shape/size analysis are presented on the right. The red cross within each outline is the centroid, and blue lines represent lobe height and width. The mean (\xc2\xb1 SD) of the mPC1 (\xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x924) and height:width ratio (H:W) shape measures for each genotype highlight the inverse correlation between these two measures. Phenotype means are calculated from a single lobe from 29 b3852, 21 F1, and 25 Sam males. mPC1 alone appears to provide the clearest descriptor of posterior lobe morphological variation in the b3852 \xc3\x97 Sam cross. This finding is highlighted in Figure S2, which sorts the mapping population individuals by their mPC1 score and demonstrates a clear morphological transition from the b3852 lobe phenotype to the Sam lobe phenotype as mPC1 score increases. Because the correlation between lobe area and mPC1 is low (Table 2), we are able to consider lobe size and lobe shape (as measured by mPC1) as separate sources of morphological variation in this cross. Figure 2 shows the average mPC1 score in both parental lines, the F1, and both the F2 and F17 recombinant populations. As expected, the genetically variable samples show greater variation than the parentals and hybrids. In addition, the F1 hybrid males have a mPC1 phenotype that is midway between the parental line means, suggesting the trait is largely additive (see also Figure 3). Principal components can be difficult to interpret in terms of familiar shape concepts, and we sought to define what aspect of lobe shape mPC1 describes in this cross. We measured the height and width of each lobe as the vertical and horizontal distance through the outline centroid, respectively, and took the ratio of height:width (H:W). Figure 3 shows that H:W and mPC1 show a strong negative relationship in the parental lines and the F1, and we found a strong negative correlation between the traits in both the F2 and the F17 (r = \xe2\x88\x920.86 and \xe2\x88\x920.67, respectively; Table 2). Thus, this quite crude H:W shape measure describes much of the same shape variation encapsulated by mPC1 and allows us to think of mPC1 as predominantly describing how squat or slender a lobe is. We first carried out standard F2 QTL mapping to provide a coarse map of loci contributing to morphological variation between b3852 (tall, narrow lobe) and Sam (low, broad lobe). Using interval mapping on 367 F2 individuals genotyped for a genome wide panel of markers, we identified an extremely strong QTL on chromosome 3 for mPC1 (LOD = 79.2 close to the centromere; top panel of Figure 4) and two smaller QTL near the tip of 2L (LOD = 4.9 and 3.7). These same QTL were also identified for the H:W shape measure, consistent with the strong correlation between this trait and mPC1 (Table 2). These QTL mapping analyses were conducted using the phenotypic score from only a single lobe per individual, but when we repeated the analysis and substituted data from the other lobe (if available), we identified the same QTL (Figure S3). This result was anticipated as there is a strong correlation between the mPC1 shape score for the paired lobes (r = 0.85). Autosomal QTL contribute to lobe shape variation between b3852 and Sam. Likelihood profiles from interval mapping (IM) are shown for mPC1 and the height:width ratio (H:W) for both the coarse- and fine-mapping experiments. In addition, the profile from composite interval mapping (CIM) is shown for mPC1 in the coarse-mapping experiment. The three major fine-mapped mPC1 QTL discussed in the text (Q1, Q2, Q3) are highlighted. The horizontal dotted line represents a 5% significance threshold, and as thresholds for each trait were very similar, we conservatively present only the highest threshold. The same set of 87 SNP markers was used for both mapping experiments (ticks along the X-axis), but care should be taken when comparing the two sets of plots as map lengths differ (given in cM, F17 length > F2 length), and relative marker spacing is not necessarily preserved. Above the likelihood profiles, we mark with solid red circles the positions of 22 plausible candidate genes that show sex-biased gene expression in genital discs (Chatterjee et al. 2011). These are (from left to right): X chromosome = CG4766, Nep1, lz, and FucTC; chromosome 2 = al, CG4267, CG31686, msl-2, salr, ap, Wnt2, and Poxn; chromosome 3 = bab1, toe, eyg, caup, AP-2, dsx, Ctr1B, abd-A, bnl, and Dr. Although IM has high power to identify QTL, it can provide unreliable estimates of the number and location of QTL (Zeng 1994; Cornforth and Long 2003). Therefore, we applied CIM to the mPC1 dataset to increase precision and further resolve QTL. Using a window size of 10 cM and four marker covariates, we found a novel QTL on the X, a single QTL at the tip of 2L, and resolved the broad third chromosome QTL into three separate QTL (Figure 4). However, by manipulating the window size and altering the number of markers fitted to the model, we found we could generate quite different LOD profiles, although all runs did include a large QTL interval spanning the chromosome 3 centromere. IM was applied to all other phenotypes measured in the F2 (i.e., lobe area, height, width, and mPC2-mPC6), regardless of the proportion of morphological variation explained or whether the trait discriminated the parental lines. The likelihood profiles shown in Figure S3 reveal a number of additional QTL underlying various aspects of lobe morphology. Notably, the lobe height and width LOD profiles are similar to those for mPC1 and H:W, reflecting the strong correlation between these traits (Table 2). The profiles for lobe area and mPC3 also follow each other closely, with QTL at the tip of the X and the middle of 3R, again due to a high positive correlation between the traits (Table 2). Finally, we note that chromosome 4 failed to show a significant association with any trait tested in the F2 panel (data not shown). Ultimately, rather than applying additional statistical analyses to a standard F2 dataset, the best way to improve QTL mapping resolution, generate accurate estimates of QTL effects, and promote the identification of the causative nucleotide polymorphisms, is to increase the number of crossover events in the mapping population (e.g., Cheng et al. 2010). Following Darvasi and Soller (1995), we generated an F17 advanced intercross line (AIL) between b3852 and Sam, passing the population through additional rounds of recombination (limited to females in Drosophila) to expand the genetic map by over 7-fold. We also elected to utilize a selective genotyping approach for the F17 population to reduce genotyping costs while maintaining high mapping power (Lander and Botstein 1989; Darvasi and Soller 1992). Because our goal was to fine-map QTL for mPC1, we chose to genotype subsets of the F17 individuals with mPC1 values most similar to the parental strains (F17 \xe2\x80\x9ctail\xe2\x80\x9d individuals in Figure 3). These individuals were genotyped for the same 87 SNP markers used for the F2, with all adjacent markers along a chromosome remaining linked on the expanded F17 genetic map. Figure 4 (bottom panel) presents the results of fine mapping with IM for both mPC1 and the correlated H:W trait, showing similar results to the F2 map. The large pericentromeric chromosome 3 mPC1 QTL is preserved on fine mapping (Q3; LOD = 10.0); a second QTL on 3L (Q2; LOD = 6.8) is present in approximately the same location as the F2 CIM QTL; and there are QTL on chromosome 2L, including a relatively large QTL in the middle of 2L (Q1; LOD = 6.2). We found no evidence for a QTL in the middle of 3R in the F17 IM analysis similar to that we identified with CIM in the F2, either due to low power to detect it in the F17 or because the F2 CIM QTL was an artifact (we did not routinely map this QTL when varying the analysis parameters for CIM). In considering fine-mapping power, it should be noted that during laboratory maintenance of the F17 population, either drift or selection led to a reduction in Sam allele frequency at various points along the genome. One indication of the skewed allele frequency is that the most Sam-like F17 flies are not as phenotypically extreme as the inbred Sam parent (Figure 2), implying a dearth of individuals homozygous for Sam alleles at loci contributing to posterior lobe variation. In addition, the frequency of Sam alleles is very low along the entire X chromosome and at the very telomeric end of 3R in all genotyped F17 flies (Figure S4), limiting our power to detect QTL in these regions. We hypothesize that the Sam genome carries slightly deleterious alleles at several loci and that individuals homozygous for these alleles were at a competitive disadvantage during creation of the AIL, resulting in a reduction in Sam allele frequency. Various multigenerational crossing designs can be used to create AILs while limiting the effects of drift and selection (e.g., Rockman and Kruglyak 2008). Although more cumbersome than typical methods of maintaining large fly populations, such strategies are likely to be beneficial in maintaining a consistent level of mapping power along the genome in AIL-based QTL studies. To explore our mPC1 QTL data further, we used various routines from R/qtl (Broman and Sen 2009), beginning with a simple model including the three QTL (Q1, Q2, and Q3) that each have LOD scores > 6 and in which we have the greatest confidence (Figure 4). The \xe2\x80\x98addqtl\xe2\x80\x99 function did not indicate that more QTL should be added to the model, although there was some suggestion of an additional QTL at the very tip of 2L. Using a combination of the \xe2\x80\x98addint\xe2\x80\x99 function, which asks whether allowing QTL to interact improves the model fit, and a direct two-dimensional scan for epistatic QTL with \xe2\x80\x98scantwo,\xe2\x80\x99 we found that Q1 and Q2 interact. The final model, y = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q1 \xc3\x97 Q2, explains an estimated 26.5% of the phenotypic variance (using the \xe2\x80\x98fitqtl\xe2\x80\x99 function). Each QTL contributes 4.6\xe2\x80\x9310.7% to mPC1 variation (Table 3), and the Q1 \xc3\x97 Q2 interaction contributes 5.5%. For all three QTL, substitution of a b3852 allele for a Sam allele increases mPC1 (giving a more Sam-like phenotype), with Q2 and Q3 acting predominantly additively and Q1 having a large dominance component (Table 3). It seems clear that no single QTL explains a large fraction of the morphological variation between the parental strains and that, instead, trait variation is conferred by the action of a number of relatively small-effect QTL. This is particularly true ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

n light of our somewhat low F17 sample size, which has likely resulted in our overestimating QTL effects (Beavis 1994). The goal of fine mapping is to reduce QTL map intervals, thereby promoting identification of the causative gene or polymorphism. We succeeded in expanding the map length of the autosomal genome by a factor of >7 between the F2 and F17 generations, and the confidence intervals for fine-mapped QTL are smaller than in the coarse-mapping study. Nonetheless, the three major QTL we identify are still mapped to relatively broad genetic distances (6,16, and 5 cM for Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively, on the standard genetic map of D. melanogaster) that encompass hundreds of genes (Table 3). Q3 covers a particularly large physical distance as it resides over the centromere of the third chromosome where the rate of recombination is low. We anticipate being able to improve resolution and decrease the size of the genomic regions implicated by maintaining the AIL for many additional generations prior to QTL mapping and by adding markers to increase the number of informative recombination events across QTL intervals (see Macdonald and Long 2007). An important challenge in evolutionary genetics is to describe the relationship between intra- and interspecific genetic variation (see Nuzhdin and Reiwitch 2000). Using data from QTL experiments, we can ask whether the properties of loci contributing to trait variation within a species are similar to the properties of loci responsible for trait divergence between species. Such efforts have been used to suggest a shared genetic basis for floral trait variation within Mimulus guttatus and between M. guttatus and M. nasutus, as 11/16 intraspecific QTL map to the same locations in the interspecific cross (Fishman et al. 2002; Hall et al. 2006). Conversely, due to a lack of overlap between QTL mapped in intra- and interspecies crosses, current evidence suggests there is a qualitative difference in the genetic architecture of courtship song within D. melanogaster and between D. simulans and D. sechellia (Gleason et al. 2002; Gleason and Ritchie 2004). The main result from our study is the identification of at least three moderate-effect QTL contributing to posterior lobe shape between a pair of inbred lines of D. melanogaster. The positions of these QTL map to approximately the same locations as QTL mapped in various interspecific crosses (Figure 7 in Liu et al. 1996; Figure 3 in Macdonald and Goldstein 1999; Figure 2 in Zeng et al. 2000; Figure 6 in Masly et al. 2011). Interspecific posterior lobe QTL have also been mapped to the tip of 2L and 3L in these studies, sites where we also find LOD scores just above the QTL significance threshold. This overlap in QTL positions suggests some of the same genes could be responsible for lobe shape variation both within and among species of Drosophila. There is, of course, a clear caveat: Mapping resolution in all studies considered is relatively low and with >14,000 genes, only three major chromosomes, and the possibility that a large number of genes influence the trait, these QTL could overlap simply by chance. Short of positionally cloning the causative gene (see Wittkopp et al. 2009), progress toward a rigorous comparison of the pattern of genetic variation within and among species is likely to come only when the QTL are resolved to very short intervals and can be isolated from the effects of others in introgression lines. In general, large, highly recombinant mapping populations must be employed to achieve this, although in D. melanogaster investigators can make use of molecularly characterized deletions or loss-of-function mutations to implicate putative causative genes via quantitative complementation tests (Long et al. 1996; Pasyukova et al. 2000). In common with the rest of the male and female adult genitalia, the posterior lobe develops from the larval genital imaginal disc. Chatterjee et al. (2011) used microarrays to identify 22 euchromatic genes that consistently differ in expression between male and female D. melanogaster genital discs across three developmental time points (L3 larvae, 6 hr and 20 hr after puparium formation). Seven of these genes were also found by Masly et al. (2011), comparing male and female discs in L3 larvae only. In addition, at least 2 of the genes found in both studies (Pox neuro and Drop) can be mutated to alter adult posterior lobe morphology (Boll and Noll 2002; Chatterjee et al. 2011). We highlight the positions of these 22 loci in Figure 4 (red points above each plot) and note a visually striking overlap between the mPC1 QTL peaks and candidate gene positions, particularly on the autosomes. Interestingly, the classic sex-determining gene doublesex (Hildreth 1965) is within the 2-LOD drop for the pericentromeric QTL Q3. This gene was identified as male-biased in the developing D. melanogaster genital disc by both Chatterjee et al. (2011) and Masly et al. (2011), and it was also one of the genes the latter identified as differentially expressed between D. mauritiana and D. sechellia in male genital discs. To test for a statistical association between our QTL results and these candidate loci, we used a resampling procedure (Keightley et al. 1998). One million sets of 18 autosomal loci were randomly sampled, and the mPC1 LOD scores at the 18 positions summed (the X chromosome was ignored because the low Sam allele frequency on this chromosome in the F17 likely compromised mapping power). This procedure gives a distribution of the expected LOD scores assuming no relationship between our phenotype and the Chatterjee et al. (2011) candidate genes. The sum of the PC1 LOD scores at the actual locations of the 18 autosomal candidate genes is 68.7, which is in the top 1% of the null distribution (mean = 39.1, standard deviation = 9.33), indicating a significant association between the two datasets. Thus, those genes that show sex-biased gene expression in genital discs and are present within QTL intervals (see Figure 4 legend) are plausible candidates to harbor natural genetic variants contributing to posterior lobe shape.

Cook', 'Mike Tyers', 'Vivien Measday']","October 4, 2011.",Genome-wide Fitness Profiles Reveal a Requirement for Autophagy During Yeast Fermentation,"b'The ability of cells to respond to environmental changes and adapt their metabolism enables cell survival under stressful conditions. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) is particularly well adapted to the harsh conditions of anaerobic wine fermentation. However, S. cerevisiae gene function has not been previously systematically interrogated under conditions of industrial fermentation. We performed a genome-wide study of essential and nonessential S. cerevisiae gene requirements during grape juice fermentation to identify deletion strains that are either depleted or enriched within the viable fermentative population. Genes that function in autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome degradation are required for optimal survival during fermentation, whereas genes that function in ribosome assembly and peroxisome biogenesis impair fitness during fermentation. We also uncover fermentation phenotypes for 139 uncharacterized genes with no previously known cellular function. We demonstrate that autophagy is induced early in wine fermentation in a nitrogen-replete environment, suggesting that autophagy may be triggered by other forms of stress that arise during fermentation. These results provide insights into the complex fermentation process and suggest possible means for improvement of industrial fermentation strains.The budding yeast S. cerevisiae is a hallmark model organism for understanding cellular and molecular processes; it is also one of the most important industrial microorganisms for food and enzyme production. The ability of S. cerevisiae to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions, including survival in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and to out-compete other microbes by virtue of its high tolerance for ethanol has underpinned the propagation of S. cerevisiae strains optimized for fermentation performance. Evolutionary pressures acting on the S. cerevisiae genome have resulted in gains of genes to enable adaptation to anaerobic fermentation (Gordon et al. 2009). Although industrial fermentation is an anthropic environment, S. cerevisiae naturally proliferates in the interior of rotting fruit such as damaged grape berries, where it effectively creates a fermentative environment (Mortimer and Polsinelli 1999). In fact, the progenitor of the laboratory yeast strain S288C, which was the first eukaryotic genome to be sequenced, was isolated from a rotting fig in California in 1938 (Goffeau et al. 1996; Mortimer and Johnston 1986). Despite the explosion in genomics, proteomics, and systems biology since the sequencing of S288C, \xe2\x88\xbc1000 of the \xe2\x88\xbc6200 annotated yeast genes still have no known function (Pena-Castillo and Hughes 2007). However, to date, most high-throughput functional genomic analyses have been acquired under laboratory conditions that do not closely resemble the natural fermentative lifestyle of S. cerevisiae. During fermentation of grape juice, S. cerevisiae is exposed to many stresses, including high osmolarity (20\xe2\x80\x9340% equimolar glucose:fructose), organic acid stress (pH 3\xe2\x80\x933.5), limiting nitrogen, anaerobiosis, and ethanol toxicity [final concentration 12\xe2\x80\x9315% (v/v)]. Whole-genome gene expression analysis of wine yeast strains during fermentation under wine-making conditions has demonstrated dramatic expression changes in \xe2\x88\xbc40% of the genome, including upregulation of stress response, energy production, and surprisingly, glucose repressed genes (Backhus et al. 2001; Marks et al. 2008; Perez-Ortin et al. 2002; Rossignol et al. 2003; Varela et al. 2005). Studies of short-term stress response in laboratory yeast strains have identified a signature environmental stress response of 10\xe2\x80\x9320% of the genome to changes in temperature, nutrients, osmotic shock, and nutrient depletion (Causton et al. 2001; Gasch et al. 2000; Gasch and Werner-Washburne 2002). Although genome-wide expression data have provided valuable insights, gene mRNA expression profiles often do not correlate with gene requirement under specific conditions (Giaever et al. 2002; Winzeler et al. 1999). In addition, protein levels and function are often affected by post-translational modification in the absence of changes in gene expression. A comparison of the transcriptome and proteome of a wine yeast strain during fermentation revealed only a weak correlation between changes in mRNA and protein abundance at stationary phase (Rossignol et al. 2009). Thus, to gain insight as to how yeast cells sense and respond to environmental conditions, the functional requirement for each gene must be analyzed. Laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae exhibit suboptimal fermentation performance compared with industrial S. cerevisiae strains because of their inability to convert all sugars present in grape must to ethanol (Pizarro et al. 2007). However, an auxotrophic laboratory strain of S288C is able to ferment grape juice to completion by supplementation of required amino acids and reduction of sugars (Harsch et al. 2009). Although earlier studies demonstrated aneuploidy in some wine yeast strains, recent karyotypic analysis of four commercial S. cerevisiae wine yeast strains revealed only small to moderate variations in gene copy number compared with S288C, with no major chromosomal rearrangements or abnormal chromosome numbers (Dunn et al. 2005; Pretorius 2000). In addition, genetic analysis of 45 commercial yeast strains showed that 40 strains were diploid whereas only five were aneuploid (Bradbury et al. 2006). Recent sequencing studies have provided the yeast community with new insight into the genomic variation between S. cerevisiae laboratory, industrial, clinical, and wild strains (Borneman et al. 2008; Liti et al. 2009; Novo et al. 2009; Schacherer et al. 2009; Wei et al. 2007). Genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of 86 S. cerevisiae strains demonstrated that wine yeast strains from geographically distinct locations are closely related, suggesting a single domestication event (Liti et al. 2009; Schacherer et al. 2009). The genome of the commercial wine yeast strain EC1118 possesses three unique chromosomal regions encompassing 34 genes, of which two regions contain DNA from a non-Saccharomyces origin (Novo et al. 2009). Although these unique chromosomal regions are likely involved in the adaptation of EC1118 to industrial fermentation conditions, 99% of predicted EC1118 open reading frames (ORF) are in common with S288C (Novo et al. 2009). Likewise when the genomes of the wine yeast strain AWRI1631 and S288C were compared, although \xe2\x88\xbc68,000 single nucleotide variations were identified, the proteomes exhibited over 99.3% amino acid identity (Borneman et al. 2008). The fact that gene order, predicted ORFs, and proteomes are highly similar between S. cerevisiae S288C and wine yeast strains suggests that genomic technologies developed in S288C may be exploited to reveal gene functions required to cope with the dynamic stresses imposed by fermentation. The comprehensive yeast gene deletion strain collection has enabled high-throughput screens for phenotypic traits of yeast genes; however, many of the physiological conditions tested are not relevant to industrial or natural yeast environments (Scherens and Goffeau 2004). A competitive fitness study of the heterozygous deletion mutant collection under conditions of nitrogen limitation revealed that impaired 26S proteasome function afforded a growth advantage, suggesting that a defect in protein degradation may be beneficial when nutrients are limiting (Delneri et al. 2008). Although the majority of the yeast genome is nonessential when grown in laboratory conditions, a comprehensive set of chemical genomic profiles uncovered a phenotype for 97% of yeast genes under chemical or environmental stress conditions (Hillenmeyer et al. 2008). Although a number of studies have assessed the deletion collection for ethanol sensitivity, very few genes appear in common across the different datasets, suggesting that the cellular response to ethanol may depend heavily upon precise experimental conditions (Fujita et al. 2006; Kubota et al. 2004; Kumar et al. 2008; Teixeira et al. 2009; Van Voorst et al. 2006; Yazawa et al. 2007; Yoshikawa et al. 2009). Finally, the deletion collection has been screened to identify yeast genes that confer resistance to inhibitors of bioethanol fermentation (Endo et al. 2008; Gorsich et al. 2006). Notably, genome-wide analysis of genetic requirements during wine fermentation has not been previously reported. Here, we profile the genome-wide yeast deletion collection in S288C over a 14 day fermentation period to identify deletion strains that confer either a fitness defect or an advantage. Strains with fitness defects during fermentation were enriched for gene deletions in three major categories: autophagy, modification by ubiquitination, and proteasome degradation. Strains with a fitness advantage during fermentation were compromised for ribosomal proteins, peroxisome biogenesis, or phosphate homeostasis. Autophagy is the process whereby cytoplasmic components and excess organelles are degraded; we demonstrate that autophagy is induced under wine fermentation conditions. Finally, deletion of 139 uncharacterized genes alters yeast fitness during fermentation, suggesting that interrogation under nonstandard laboratory conditions will be required to uncover the function of many strongly selected genes in yeast evolution.'","b""The ability of cells to respond to environmental changes and adapt their metabolism enables cell survival under stressful conditions.

In addition, protein levels and function are often affected by post-translational modification in the absence of changes in gene expression. A comparison of the transcriptome and proteome of a wine yeast strain during fermentation revealed only a weak correlation between changes in mRNA and protein abundance at stationary phase (Rossignol et al. 2009). Thus, to gain insight as to how yeast cells sense and respond to environmental conditions, the functional requirement for each gene must be analyzed. Laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae exhibit suboptimal fermentation performance compared with industrial S. cerevisiae strains because of their inability to convert all sugars present in grape must to ethanol (Pizarro et al. 2007). However, an auxotrophic laboratory strain of S288C is able to ferment grape juice to completion by supplementation of required amino acids and reduction of sugars (Harsch et al. 2009). Although earlier studies demonstrated aneuploidy in some wine yeast strains, recent karyotypic analysis of four commercial S. cerevisiae wine yeast strains revealed only small to moderate variations in gene copy number compared with S288C, with no major chromosomal rearrangements or abnormal chromosome numbers (Dunn et al. 2005; Pretorius 2000). In addition, genetic analysis of 45 commercial yeast strains showed that 40 strains were diploid whereas only five were aneuploid (Bradbury et al. 2006). Recent sequencing studies have provided the yeast community with new insight into the genomic variation between S. cerevisiae laboratory, industrial, clinical, and wild strains (Borneman et al. 2008; Liti et al. 2009; Novo et al. 2009; Schacherer et al. 2009; Wei et al. 2007). Genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of 86 S. cerevisiae strains demonstrated that wine yeast strains from geographically distinct locations are closely related, suggesting a single domestication event (Liti et al. 2009; Schacherer et al. 2009). The genome of the commercial wine yeast strain EC1118 possesses three unique chromosomal regions encompassing 34 genes, of which two regions contain DNA from a non-Saccharomyces origin (Novo et al. 2009). Although these unique chromosomal regions are likely involved in the adaptation of EC1118 to industrial fermentation conditions, 99% of predicted EC1118 open reading frames (ORF) are in common with S288C (Novo et al. 2009). Likewise when the genomes of the wine yeast strain AWRI1631 and S288C were compared, although \xe2\x88\xbc68,000 single nucleotide variations were identified, the proteomes exhibited over 99.3% amino acid identity (Borneman et al. 2008). The fact that gene order, predicted ORFs, and proteomes are highly similar between S. cerevisiae S288C and wine yeast strains suggests that genomic technologies developed in S288C may be exploited to reveal gene functions required to cope with the dynamic stresses imposed by fermentation. The comprehensive yeast gene deletion strain collection has enabled high-throughput screens for phenotypic traits of yeast genes; however, many of the physiological conditions tested are not relevant to industrial or natural yeast environments (Scherens and Goffeau 2004). A competitive fitness study of the heterozygous deletion mutant collection under conditions of nitrogen limitation revealed that impaired 26S proteasome function afforded a growth advantage, suggesting that a defect in protein degradation may be beneficial when nutrients are limiting (Delneri et al. 2008). Although the majority of the yeast genome is nonessential when grown in laboratory conditions, a comprehensive set of chemical genomic profiles uncovered a phenotype for 97% of yeast genes under chemical or environmental stress conditions (Hillenmeyer et al. 2008). Although a number of studies have assessed the deletion collection for ethanol sensitivity, very few genes appear in common across the different datasets, suggesting that the cellular response to ethanol may depend heavily upon precise experimental conditions (Fujita et al. 2006; Kubota et al. 2004; Kumar et al. 2008; Teixeira et al. 2009; Van Voorst et al. 2006; Yazawa et al. 2007; Yoshikawa et al. 2009). Finally, the deletion collection has been screened to identify yeast genes that confer resistance to inhibitors of bioethanol fermentation (Endo et al. 2008; Gorsich et al. 2006). Notably, genome-wide analysis of genetic requirements during wine fermentation has not been previously reported. Here, we profile the genome-wide yeast deletion collection in S288C over a 14 day fermentation period to identify deletion strains that confer either a fitness defect or an advantage. Strains with fitness defects during fermentation were enriched for gene deletions in three major categories: autophagy, modification by ubiquitination, and proteasome degradation. Strains with a fitness advantage during fermentation were compromised for ribosomal proteins, peroxisome biogenesis, or phosphate homeostasis. Autophagy is the process whereby cytoplasmic components and excess organelles are degraded; we demonstrate that autophagy is induced under wine fermentation conditions. Finally, deletion of 139 uncharacterized genes alters yeast fitness during fermentation, suggesting that interrogation under nonstandard laboratory conditions will be required to uncover the function of many strongly selected genes in yeast evolution. The S288C diploid homozygous and heterozygous deletion pools were created as described (Ooi et al. 2001). The homozygous deletion pool (MAT a/\xce\xb1 gene X\xce\x94KanMX4/gene X\xce\x94KanMX4 his3\xce\x941/his3\xce\x941 leu2\xce\x940/leu2\xce\x940 ura3\xce\x940/ura3\xce\x940 met15\xce\x940/MET15 lys2\xce\x940/LYS2) was purchased from Invitrogen and contains 4653 homozygous deletions represented equally at a concentration of 2 \xc3\x97 107 cells/mL. The heterozygous deletion pool (MAT a/\xce\xb1 gene X\xce\x94KanMX4/GENE X his3\xce\x941/his3\xce\x941 leu2\xce\x940/leu2\xce\x940 ura3\xce\x940/ura3\xce\x940 met15\xce\x940/MET15 lys2\xce\x940/LYS2) was generated in the following manner. Individual heterozygous deletion mutants (Open Biosystems, #YSC1055, 5797 unique ORFs) were pinned onto YPD plates (96 colonies per plate) containing G418 (200 \xce\xbcg/mL, Gibco #1181-031) and incubated at 25\xc2\xb0 for three days. Five mL of YPD (supplemented with 100 \xce\xbcg/mL G418) were added to each plate, cells were resuspended using a glass rod, and then transferred into a flask on ice. Glycerol was added to 15% final concentration, and cells were frozen in 1 mL aliquots (OD600 = 15.0). One biological replicate of the homozygous and heterozygous deletion pools (6 \xc3\x97 106 cells), the S288C parental strain (BY4743), and the EC1118 strain were each grown overnight in rich glucose medium [YPD: 2% glucose (Fisher Scientific #D15-12), 2% bacto-peptone (BD #DF0118072), 1% yeast extract (BD #DF0127071)] to mid\xe2\x80\x93log phase, washed in sterile water, and then resuspended in filter-sterilized synthetic grape juice [10% glucose, 10% fructose (Acros Organics #161350025), 0.45% malic acid (Sigma-Aldrich #M1000), 0.45% tartaric acid (Sigma-Aldrich #T1807), 0.03% citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich #C83155), 0.2% (NH4)2SO4 (Fisher #A702-3), 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Difco #DF0335159), 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80 (Sigma P4780), 0.8 mM tryptophan (Sigma #T0254), 0.2 mM uracil (Sigma #U0750), 0.16 mM adenine (Sigma #A9126), 0.2 mM lysine (Sigma #L5501), 2 mM leucine (Sigma #L8000), 0.2 mM histidine (Sigma #H8125), adjusted to pH 3.0)] and inoculated into 500 mL of filter-sterilized synthetic grape juice at 2 \xc3\x97 106 cells/mL in a 500 mL Kimax bottle fitted with a vapor lock. Fermentations were carried out at 21\xc2\xb0. The first time point was taken 24 h post inoculation into synthetic grape juice and was used as a control in all hybridizations. Subsequent time points were taken at days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14 by withdrawal of 2 mL of culture through an airtight rubber seal. Aliquots were centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored at \xe2\x88\x9280\xc2\xb0 and subsequently used for metabolite analysis. To select for live cells in the barcode microarray analysis of the homozygous and heterozygous deletion pools, pellets were resuspended in sterile water and grown on YPD + 200 \xc2\xb5g/mL G418 agar (Difco, #DF0145170) medium at 25\xc2\xb0 for two days prior to harvesting and extraction of genomic DNA. Fermentation bottles were weighed every two days, and a sample of the supernatant was extracted for metabolite analysis. Ethanol, fructose, and glucose were detected using an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system with an Agilent Refractive Index detector and autosampler. A 1 \xce\xbcL sample was injected onto a Supelcogel C610H cation exchange column and a Supelguard C610H guard column at 0.75 mL/min with a degassed 0.22 \xce\xbcm filtered 0.1% H3PO4 mobile phase using a column temperature of 50\xc2\xb0 and a refractive index temperature of 35\xc2\xb0. Calibration and data analysis/quantitation were performed with LC/MSD Chemstation (Software Revision Rev. A.09.03). Yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN; total alpha amino acids and ammonium) was measured with N-PANOPA and K-LARGE kits from Megazyme (Megazyme International Ireland) according to manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. Barcode amplification and hybridization were performed as described (Cook et al. 2008) using amplification primers from Operon Biotechnologies. Arrays were scanned visually for anomalies, which were flagged and discarded as necessary. The median local background-subtracted intensities were converted to log2 ratios, and the data were Lowess normalized using the program Vector Xpression 3. Data with negative values in either channel were adjusted to a floor value of 1 for further calculations. Log2 intensity values [A = 0.5*log2(Cy5*Cy3)] were chosen individually for UP and DOWN (DN) barcode tags of each microarray to maximize recovery of true positives and minimize recovery of false positives as described (Cook et al. 2008) except using log2 intensity values instead of signal-to-noise ratios. In the case of the homozygous deletion pool experiments, intensity thresholds included less than 5% of false-positive signals. In the case of heterozygous deletion pool experiments, the majority of barcodes on the array were present within the pool. As such, an alternative method was required to set intensity thresholds; these were chosen qualitatively to exclude the low-intensity peak within the bimodal distribution of signals in a Log2 intensity (A) vs. frequency plot, representing presumptive nonfunctional barcodes. To further minimize false positives and maximize true positives, UP and DN barcodes with significant data for less than 40% of all replicate spots across all experiments were excluded from subsequent analysis. UP and DN tags for each array were independently converted to Z scores before being combined (centered to an average log2 ratio value of 0 and normalized to a standard deviation of 1). Replicate spots were averaged, and remaining false barcodes of strains not present in the homozygous or heterozygous deletion pool were removed. The data were clustered using Cluster 3.0 (De Hoon et al. 2004); prior to clustering, data were filtered to remove barcodes with no significant change across any time point (all log2 values < 1) or to include only those with significant change in 50% of experiments. Data were clustered hierarchically, with average linkage and an uncentered correlation similarity metric. Heat maps were generated using the program Java Treeview (Saldanha 2004). Microarray information can be accessed at ArrayExpress (E-MEXP-3332). To identify enriched functional categories, heterozygous and homozygous deletion mutants with a fitness disadvantage or advantage were queried using Funspec (Robinson et al. 2002), and categories with a P value of 0.01 or less were analyzed further. All genes listed under a given Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) category were compared with all genes from the homozygous deletion pool (3734) or the heterozygous deletion pool (5470) that had significant data on our array. The number of genes in each MIPS functional classification category (459 total categories were queried) that were present on the array are represented in Tables 2\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x87\x93\xe2\x87\x93\xe2\x87\x93 in the \xe2\x80\x9ctotal genes in dataset\xe2\x80\x9d column. The number of genes with a 2-fold or greater decrease or increase in abundance compared with control in at least three of the fermentation time points are presented in the \xe2\x80\x9ctotal genes observed\xe2\x80\x9d column. P values were calculated using the hypergeometric cumulative distribution function and adjusted with a Bonferroni correction. Genes that were not annotated in the various MIPS categories, but nevertheless bear related functions, were manually added when necessary. The API Western blot was performed as follows. 1.5 \xc3\x97 107 cells per sample were TCA precipitated, vortexed with 50 \xce\xbcL glass beads and 50 \xce\xbcL SDS gel loading buffer, boiled, run on an SDS-PAGE gel, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with a 1:4000 dilution of anti-API antibody [kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Klionsky (Klionsky et al. 1992)] and a 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibody (goat-anti rabbit HRP conjugate, Bio-Rad). The homozygous pep4\xce\x94/pep4\xce\x94 log phase and two-day fermented yeast were concentrated by centrifugation. The yeast were high-pressure frozen in Type A HPF specimen carriers (Technotrade International, Manchester, NH) with a Leica HPM 100 (Vienna, Austria). Frozen samples were then freeze-substituted in a Leica AFS (Vienna, Austria) as follows: two days at \xe2\x88\x9285\xc2\xb0 in HPLC-grade acetone [containing 8% dimethoxypropane (DMP), 0.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1% tannic acid], followed with several washes in clean acetone (\xe2\x88\x9285\xc2\xb0), transferred to HPLC-grade acetone (containing 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.1% uranyl acetate), held at \xe2\x88\x9285\xc2\xb0 for two additional days, warmed to and held at \xe2\x88\x9220\xc2\xb0 for 6 h, and finally warmed to room temperature. Substituted yeast were then washed in clean acetone and infiltrated with Spurr's resin over a graded series to 100% resin with rotation at room temperature. Ultrathin sections were cut using a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome, picked up on formvar-coated 200-mesh copper grids, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate (aqueous) and Reynold\xe2\x80\x99s lead citrate. Images were captured using an FEI Tecnai G2 (Hillsboro, OR) operated at 200 kV equipped with a 2K side-mounted Advanced Microscopy Techniques (AMT) digital camera (Danvers, MA). To identify nonessential and essential S. cerevisiae genes required for optimal cellular fitness during fermentation, the S288C heterozygous and homozygous diploid yeast deletion mutant pools were individually grown in rich media to midlogarithmic phase, then diluted into synthetic grape juice (see Materials and Methods). The diploid yeast deletion mutant collections were chosen over the haploid collections because wine yeast are primarily diploid and because the diploid collections include both essential and nonessential genes. Anaerobic fermentations were carried out for 14 days at room temperature in 500-mL flasks equipped with a vapor lock. Fermentation profiles of the heterozygous and homozygous deletion mutant pools were plotted (supporting information, Figure S1). We carried out a fermentation of the industrial wine yeast strain EC1118 to demonstrate the fermentation profile of an industrial strain under the same conditions (Figure S1). Growth reached a maximal OD600 of \xe2\x88\xbc4.2 for both homozygous and heterozygous deletion pools, whereas the EC1118 wine yeast was able to grow to an OD600 of over 6.0 (Figure S1A). After 14 days, the concentration of ethanol in the homozygous and heterozygous diploid deletion pool fermentations was 12.4% and 12.0% (v/v), respectively, whereas the EC1118 fermentation attained 14.0% (v/v) ethanol (Figure S1B). As expected, the EC1118 fermentation was more robust than the S288C homozygous and heterozygous deletion mutant pools as ethanol production reached a plateau after 6 days of fermentation, whereas the S288C pools continued to produce ethanol over the entire 14-day period. There was no discernable difference between the fermentation profiles of the homozygous and heterozygous deletion set pools. To avoid identification of yeast deletion strains that had fitness requirements due to the transfer of cells from rich media to synthetic grape juice, a control sample was taken after the homozygous and heterozygous deletion set pools had adapted for 24 h in synthetic grape juice, at which point the culture was still in logarithmic phase (Figure S1A). The day 1 time point was used as a hybridization control for all subsequent time points at days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14 of fermentation. Homozygous and heterozygous deletion strains that exhibited a 2-fold or greater alteration in barcode signal intensity in experimental over control sample in three or more time points were deemed to have either decreased or increased fitness during the fermentation. By this criterion, we identified 300 homozygous (Table S1) and 481 heterozygous (Table S4) deletion strains with reduced fitness during fermentation with an overlap of 38 genes (Table S7). Similarly, we identified 303 homozygous (Table S2) and 466 heterozygous (Table S5) deletion strains with increased fitness during fermentation with an overlap of 48 genes (Table S8). Of the heterozygous deletion mutants with reduced fitness, 116 are essential, and of the heterozygous deletion mutants with increased fitness, 111 are essential, which partially accounts for the low overlap between the datasets (Table 1). Approximately 20% of the deletion strains identified in each screen were deletions of uncharacterized genes and dubious ORFs (Table 1). Thus, nutrient and ethanol stress, as well as oxygen deprivation caused by fermentation, revealed potential roles for genes whose function has not been identified under conventional laboratory conditions. We performed hierarchical cluster analysis of the 300 homozygous deletion strains (Figure 1A) and 481 heterozygous deletion strains (Figure 1B) with reduced fitness during fermentation. We found that some barcodes show inconsistencies across time points (e.g. depleted in day 2 yet enriched in day 4), likely due to noise in the data because each time point consisted of one biological replicate. Despite this caveat, clustering of the homozygous deletion strains with reduced fitness during fermentation revealed a strong cluster of autophagy genes, deletion of which caused progressive fitness defects over the fermentation period (Figure 1A). Consistently, autoproteolytic processing was the most highly enriched functional category in the entire dataset (P value of 4.5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9217, Table 2). Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved degradative process by which cytoplasmic constituents and organelles are sequestered into vesicles known as autophagosomes, which in turn fuse with the vacuole and thereby degrade their contents (Nakatogawa et al. 2009; Xie and Klionsky 2007). More selective forms of autophagy, in which specific organelles are engulfed and degraded, include the constitutively active cytoplasm-to-vacuole (Cvt) pathway, ribophagy, mitophagy, pexophagy, and reticulophagy (Kraft et al. 2009). A core set of 15 Atg proteins is required for autophagosome formation in all types of autophagy (Atg1-10, Atg12-14, Atg16,18) and is associated with the preautophagosomal structure (PAS), which is the site adjacent to the vacuole where autophagosomes are generated (Nakatogawa et al. 2009). Thirteen of 15 strains deleted for core ATG genes and 2 of the 3 strains deleted for starvation-induced autophagy genes were significantly depleted during fermentation (Figure 2, Table 2). In contrast, strains disrupted for 6 of the 7 ATG genes that have specific roles in the constitutively active Cvt pathway were not significantly selected for or against during fermentation (Figure 2, Table 2). Hierarchical cluster analysis of (A) 300 homozygous and (B) 481 heterozygous diploid deletion strains with a fitness defect at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14 days of fermentation. Green, depletion; red, enrichment; black, no change; gray, no data. Numbers below the color bar represent the normalized log2 value of the microarray signal vs. day 1. Highlighted genes are in the functionally enriched categories of (A) autoproteolytic processing and modification by ubiquitination, deubiquitination, or (B) proteasome degradation. Genes that are listed twice on the clustergram have both UP and DOWN barcode tags that met the cutoff criteria. Core and starvation-induced autophagy genes contribute to cellular fitness during fermentation. The schematic is derived from Nakatogawa et al. (2009). Genes are color coded as follows: green, reduced fitness; black, no change in fitness; gray, no data obtained; purple, no homolog in S. cerevisiae. Cluster analysis of the heterozygous deletion strains that have decreased fitness during fermentation did not reveal a prominent cluster of genes as seen with the autophagy deletion strains; however, a functional enrichment query identified a significant enrichment of 23 genes with a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (Figure 1B, Table 3). Indeed, we additionally observed that 17 homozygous strains deleted for ubiquitin-modification genes had overt fitness defects during fermentation, a significant enrichment of this functional class of genes (Table 2). The UPS is the major intracellular degradative pathway in eukaryotes whereby individual protein substrates are selectively conjugated to the small protein modifier ubiquitin by the action of a conserved cascade of E1 (ubiquitin-activating), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) enzymes (Elsasser and Finley 2005; Hochstrasser 1996). Our analysis identified homozygous deletion strains disrupted in the stress-responsive ubiquitin gene (UBI4), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (MMS2, UBC7, UBC5), ubiquitin ligases (DOA10/SSM4, RMD5, SAN1, SKP2, UBR2), ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBP1, UBP13, UBP14), and other proteins that have various roles in the UPS (CUE1, DOA1, RFU1, UBX2, UFD2; see Table 2). Ubiquitylated proteins are targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome, which is composed of a 20S core particle that contains the proteolytic active sites and a 19S regulatory particle that controls substrate entry (Finley 2009). We identified heterozygous deletion strains disrupted for components of the core particle (PRE1, PRE2, PRE4, PRE7, PUP1) and the regulatory particle (RPN5, RPT3, RPT5, RPT6), as well as proteins involved in proteasome assembly (ECM29, POC4, UMP1) and proteasome localization (STS1; Figure 1B, Figure 3, Table 3). The \xce\xb2-ring of the proteasome core particle enhances cellular fitness during fermentation. The proteasome core particle \xce\xb1-ring (\xce\xb11-7) and \xce\xb2-ring subunits (\xce\xb21-7) are shown, along with the Irc25/Poc4 \xce\xb1-ring assembly chaperone. The proteasome regulatory particle (base and lid subunits) is also shown. Genes are color coded as follows: green, reduced fitness; red, increased fitness; black, no change in fitness; gray, no data obtained. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the 303 homozygous deletion strains that have increased fitness during fermentation did not reveal a prominent cluster of genes; however, a functional enrichment query identified a significant enrichment for peroxisome biogenesis genes (Figure 4A, Table 4). The biogenesis of peroxisomes requires the posttranslational import of peroxisomal matrix proteins; this process requires recognition by a receptor/docking complex at the surface of the peroxisome, translocation across the peroxisomal membrane, release into the peroxisome matrix, and recycling of the receptor (Smith and Aitchison 2009). Deletion strains defective in the docking complex (PEX13, PEX17), translocation process (PEX8), and receptor recycling (PEX1, PEX4, PEX6, PEX10 and PEX22) all had increased fitness during fermentation (Table 4). A strain deleted for a dubious ORF (YJL211C) that overlaps with the PEX2 receptor recycling gene was also enriched during fermentation (Table S2). Hierarchical cluster analysis of (A) 303 homozygous and (B) 466 heterozygous diploid deletion strains with a fitness advantage at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14 days of fermentation. Green, depletion; red, enrichment; black, no change; gray, no data. Numbers below the color bar represent the normalized log2 value of the microarray signal vs. day 1. Highlighted genes are in the functionally enriched categories of (A) peroxisome or (B) ribosomal proteins. A second functional category of homozygous deletion strains that was enriched during fermentation included disruptions of genes with roles in phosphate homeostasis. Strains lacking high-affinity phosphate transporters (PHO84, PHO89), a low-affinity phosphate transporter (PHO91), and the MIR1 mitochondrial phosphate carrier were all enriched as fermentation proceeded (Table 4). When cells are starved of phosphate, the expression of PHO84, PHO89, and the secreted acid phosphatases (PHO5, PHO11, PHO12) is induced to facilitate the scavenging of phosphate (Mouillon and Persson 2006). When phosphate is plentiful, Pho84 is removed from the plasma membrane and targeted to the vacuole for degradation (Lagerstedt et al. 2002). Similarly, Pho91 and another low-affinity phosphate transporter, Pho87, are targeted for endocytosis and vacuolar degradation by ubiquitination (Estrella et al. 2008). As our synthetic grape juice medium was not limiting for phosphate, we speculate that unnecessary phosphate transport expression and recycling may actually confer a fitness disadvantage under these conditions. Functional enrichment analysis of heterozygous deletion mutants with a fitness advantage during fermentation revealed a significant enrichment for the functional category of ribosomal proteins (P value of 1.5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x928, Table 5). Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed and two clusters of ribosomal genes were identified, although not all 46 ribosomal genes mapped to these clusters (Figure 4B). We identified heterozygous deletion mutants in components of the small (RPS) and large (RPL) ribosomal subunits; the ribosomal stalk (RPP1B); and components of the mitochondrial small (MRPS, PET123, RSM) and large (MRPL) ribosomal subunits, as well as proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis (DBP9, RRP15, RSA3). As deletion of some ribosomal proteins and known ribosome biogenesis factors did not appear to alter fitness during fermentation, it may be that the deletion strains that conferred resistance correspond to ribosome synthesis pathways that integrate specific aspects of nutrient responsiveness. Differential effects of ribosome proteins and ribosome biogenesis gene deletions have been observed previously in cell-size screens (Jorgensen et al. 2002). The cellular environment changes rapidly during fermentation due to the consumption of nutrients and production of ethanol. Thus, genes may be required at a specific stage of fermentation but not throughout the entire fermentation. Therefore, we reanalyzed our data in a highly stringent manner by requiring that deletion mutants display a 2-fold or greater alteration in barcode signal intensity in experimental over control sample in three or more sequential time points (Table S9, Table S10, Table S11, Table S12). By these criteria, we identified 180 homozygous (Table S9) and 210 heterozygous (Table S11) deletion mutants with reduced fitness during fermentation with an overlap of 20 genes (Table S13). One hundred sixty-two homozygous (Table S10) and 214 heterozygous (Table S12) deletion mutants have increased fitness during fermentation in three consecutive time points with an overlap of 18 genes (Table S14). We performed analysis of functional enrichment within each new dataset and found that all of the categories that were enriched previously (Tables 2\xe2\x80\x935) were still enriched with the sequential datasets, with the exception of the peroxisome genes (Table 4). This finding is likely due to data points that were missing from a few of the peroxisome genes (e.g., PEX",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 and PEX8 in Figure 4A). However, the overlap between the homozygous and heterozygous mutants with a fitness advantage during fermentation (Table S8) is enriched for genes with a role in fatty acid oxidation, which occurs in the peroxisome (see Discussion). Of the genes required for cellular fitness during fermentation, we chose to focus our biological studies on the autophagy pathway because it was the most enriched functional category (Table 2) and revealed a strong cluster of genes based on hierarchical cluster analysis (Figure 1A). We directly measured the effects of ATG gene disruptions on fermentation parameters by performing 16-day fermentations with seven different diploid atg homozygous deletion strains compared with the S288C wild-type diploid parental strain and the EC1118 industrial wine yeast strain. The atg deletion strains exhibited highly similar fermentation profiles; therefore, a representative example (atg3\xce\x94) is shown (Figure 5). As expected, EC1118 had a higher rate of fermentation than S288C with 22.0 g final weight loss and 10.8% (v/v) ethanol produced (Figure 5A, B). Compared with the S288C parental strain, atg3\xce\x94 strains had a slower rate of weight loss, indicating lower CO2 production and a reduced fermentation rate (Figure 5A). The final weight loss for the S288C parental strain was 18.4 g compared with 15.2 g for atg3\xce\x94 strains. Similarly, the final level of ethanol produced after the 16-day fermentation by the S288C parental strain was 9.0% (v/v) compared with 8.3% (v/v) for atg3\xce\x94 (Figure 5B). All of the glucose and most of the fructose (99.7%) were depleted in the EC1118 fermentation. However, the S288C fermentation contained 0.4% glucose and 2.6% fructose, and the atg3\xce\x94 fermentation contained 0.8% glucose and 3.3% fructose after 16 days (Figure 5C, D). In all cases, the differences between wild-type and atg3\xce\x94 strains are statistically significant (P < 0.02, unpaired Student\xe2\x80\x99s t-test). The atg3\xce\x94 strains do not have a slow growth phenotype compared with wild-type cells grown in rich media; therefore, lower production of ethanol by atg3\xce\x94 cells during fermentation cannot be attributed simply to attenuated growth (Figure 5E). These results demonstrate that in addition to competitive fitness defects at the population level under fermentation conditions, disruption of autophagy genes causes cells to ferment at a slower rate, resulting in reduced ethanol output and residual sugars. Disruption of atg3 causes reduced CO2 and ethanol production during fermentation. EC1118 (red diamonds), wild-type (S288C, light blue circles), and atg3\xce\x94 (green squares) homozygous diploid strains were inoculated into synthetic grape juice supplemented with amino acids, and anaerobic fermentation was carried out for 16 days. Weight loss (A), ethanol (B), glucose (C), and fructose (D) measurements were taken every 2 days. Each data point on the graph represents the average of two EC1118, four wild-type, and four atg3\xce\x94 fermentations. For all graphs, error bars represent the standard deviation for each data point. (E) Growth chamber analysis of wild-type (S288C) vs. atg3\xce\x94 strain growth in YPD at 25\xc2\xb0. Cells were inoculated into a multiwell plate at an OD600 of 0.1 and grown for 50 h. Each data point is an average of three technical replicates. For each data point, SD < \xc2\xb10.04. Our fitness profiling data suggested that autophagy, but not the constitutively active Cvt pathway, is required for optimal fitness during fermentation (Figure 2). The yeast vacuolar hydrolase aminopeptidase I (API) is synthesized in the cytoplasm in a precursor form (pAPI) that is targeted to the vacuole by either the Cvt pathway (logarithmic growth) or the autophagy pathway (starvation) (Baba et al. 1997; Klionsky et al. 1992). The conversion of pAPI to its mature form (mAPI) is associated with transport of pAPI to the vacuole and requires the Atg19 receptor in the Cvt pathway (Leber et al. 2001; Scott et al. 2001). However, upon prolonged nitrogen starvation, pAPI is processed to mAPI in the absence of Atg19 by the autophagy pathway (Leber et al. 2001; Scott et al. 2001). We performed a fermentation with wild-type (S288C) and atg19 and atg1 deletion mutants and monitored conversion of pAPI into mAPI. As expected, we detected mAPI in wild-type cells at the start of the fermentation (day 1), and the majority of pAPI was processed by day 4 of fermentation (Figure 6). pAPI was also processed to mAPI in atg19 mutants, albeit at a slower rate, which was previously shown under conditions of prolonged starvation (Leber et al. 2001) (Figure 6). However, no processing of pAPI was observed in atg1 mutants because Atg1 is essential for pAPI processing under all conditions (Figure 6). As pAPI is converted to mAPI in an Atg19-independent, but Atg1-dependent, manner, the autophagy pathway is responsible for the transport of Atg19 to the vacuole during fermentation, suggesting that autophagy is occurring during fermentation. API processing occurs via autophagy during fermentation.

Blots were probed with anti-API antibody. Arrows point to the precursor form (pAPI) and the mature form (mAPI) of API. API, aminopeptidase I. To demonstrate that autophagy is induced during fermentation, we performed electron microscopy (EM) analysis with pep4 homozygous mutant cells after two days of fermentation compared with log phase pep4 homozygous mutant cells. Autophagic bodies are rapidly degraded in wild-type cells upon entry into the vacuole, thus necessitating a vacuolar proteinase-deficient strain (such as a pep4 mutant) to visualize them (Takeshige et al. 1992). Of the vacuoles of pep4 log phase cells (N = 26), 70% were devoid of large membrane-bound vesicles (Figure 7A), whereas after two days of fermentation, autophagic bodies were clearly detected in 75% of the vacuoles imaged (N = 20, Figure 7B, arrows). Autophagic bodies are typically 300\xe2\x80\x93900 nm in diameter compared with Cvt vesicles, which are much smaller (\xe2\x88\xbc150 nm) (Baba et al. 1997; Baba et al. 1994; Takeshige et al. 1992). In addition to the autophagic bodies, we detected smaller vesicles in pep4 mutants after two days of fermentation, suggesting that the Cvt pathway may also be active (Figure 7B). Alternatively, the vacuolar sap could contain remnants of broken down autophagic bodies (Takeshige et al. 1992). Vacuoles are known to fragment when exposed to osmotic stress, and our EM images suggested that fermentation conditions may also induce vacuole fragmentation [(Bonangelino et al. 2002), Figure 7B]. Using a vacuolar-specific stain, we confirmed that vacuoles are indeed fragmented during fermentation (Figure S2). These data suggest that both autophagy and rearrangement of the vacuole are induced during wine fermentation. Autophagic bodies accumulate in the vacuole during fermentation. Electron microscopy of pep4\xce\x94/pep4\xce\x94 homozygous diploid log phase cells (A) and after two days of fermentation (B). Arrows point to autophagic bodies in the vacuole. The target of rapamycin (Tor) and protein kinase A-Sch9 signaling pathways negatively regulate autophagy; induction of autophagy requires release from this inhibition via activation of the Atg1-Atg13 kinase complex (Kamada et al. 2010; Noda and Ohsumi 1998; Stephan et al. 2009; Yorimitsu et al. 2007). Indeed, we find that a homozygous tor1\xce\x94 strain is enriched during fermentation suggesting that release from Tor1-mediated autophagy inhibition is beneficial for fermentation (Table S2). Induction of autophagy in yeast has been well studied under conditions of nitrogen starvation and inhibition of Tor under starvation conditions induces autophagy (Nakatogawa et al. 2009). To determine if nitrogen pools are depleted during our fermentation study, we did a careful analysis of the homozygous deletion set fermentation compared with the EC1118 wine yeast strain by monitoring total YAN along with metabolites, growth, and weight loss measurements. After 14 days of fermentation, the concentration of ethanol in the homozygous diploid deletion pool fermentation was 10.5% (v/v) compared with 12.2% (v/v) for EC1118 (Figure 8C). Glucose was depleted by 4 days in the EC1118 strain and by 12 days in the S288C pool (Figure 8B). Notably, total YAN, which is a measurement of total ammonium sulfate and amino acids, was retained in all fermentations, suggesting that global nitrogen starvation did not occur (Figure 8D). Fermentation kinetics of the homozygous yeast deletion pool (S288C) compared with the EC1118 wine yeast strain in synthetic grape juice. Both strains [EC1118 (red diamonds) and diploid homozygous deletion set (S288C, light blue circles)] were fermented in triplicate. The average values are presented with error bars representing SD.

Orange arrow in (A) marks when autophagic bodies are detected by electron microscopy. YAN, yeast assimilable nitrogen. Although our YAN measurements suggest that autophagy was not induced by global nitrogen starvation, we cannot assess whether single amino acids have been depleted from the media using this method. Depletion of single amino acids has been demonstrated to induce autophagy, and although we added amino acids to our fermentation media to address auxotrophies in the deletion set, single amino acid depletion may have occurred (Takeshige et al. 1992). However, autophagy is induced by two days of fermentation when cells are still in logarithmic growth (Figure 8A, orange arrow). To verify the presence of all auxotrophically required amino acids, we performed a fermentation with the homozygous deletion set parental strain, and on day two, we filtered the yeast from the fermentation and reinoculated the juice with log phase cells at an OD600 of 0.2. The media isolated from day two of fermentation, when autophagic bodies can be detected, enabled the newly inoculated cells to grow to an OD600 of over 2.0, suggesting that none of the auxotrophic amino acids were depleted (data not shown). On the basis of these results, we propose that autophagy during fermentation is not induced by amino acid depletion. Our genome-wide survey of the genetic requirements in S. cerevisiae for wine fermentation reveals a primary function for autophagy in this process (Figure 1A, Table 2). The recycling of cellular components by autophagy enables yeast to survive the stressful conditions of fermentation and maximize fermentative output. Consistent with our functional profiles, gene expression studies of S. cerevisiae wine strains reveal that the autophagy genes ATG1, ATG8, and PEP4 are induced during fermentation (Marks et al. 2008; Rossignol et al. 2003). In proteomic studies, protein fragments of glycolytic enzymes that are proteolysed in the vacuole have been detected during fermentation (Trabalzini et al. 2003). Although autophagy has not previously been documented during a primary yeast fermentation, it has been shown that autophagy is induced during secondary fermentation, possibly as a prelude to yeast cell autolysis (Cebollero and Gonzalez 2006; Cebollero et al. 2008). Together with these previous studies, our data suggests that autophagy enables yeast to survive the harsh nutrient and stress conditions that accompany fermentation. We find that autophagy is induced in the presence of nitrogen and sufficient amino acids to support doubling of cells, suggesting that an alternative signal may trigger autophagy induction during fermentation (Figures 6\xe2\x80\x938). Our analysis revealed that defects in peroxisome biogenesis and ribosome assembly confer a significant fitness advantage during fermentation (Figure 4, Tables 4, 5). Peroxisomes are degraded by a specialized form of autophagy, termed pexophagy, which is induced upon shift from oxidative growth on poor carbon sources to fermentative growth on glucose (Sakai et al. 2006). The enrichment of strains defective in peroxisome biogenesis raises the possibility that pexophagy is a critical autophagic pathway that is triggered under fermentative conditions. Interestingly, phosphofructokinase protein, but not its enzymatic activity, is required for glucose-induced pexophagy in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris (Yuan et al. 1997). One intriguing possibility is that increased glycolytic protein abundance under fermentation conditions is a trigger for pexophagy. We identified 48 genes that overlap between the homozygous and heterozygous deletion mutants with increased fitness during fermentation that are enriched for the MIPS functional classification of oxidation of fatty acids (Table S8, Robinson et al. 2002). One of these genes, PIP2, which encodes the Pip2-Oaf1 transcription factor complex that induces peroxisomal gene expression in response to fatty acids, is repressed by glucose (Gurvitz and Rottensteiner 2006). Two deletion strains with defects in fatty acid \xce\xb2-oxidation (ANT1 and TES1), which takes place in the peroxisome in yeast, also had a fitness advantage during fermentation in both the homozygous and heterozygous datasets (Table S8). In addition, a homozygous deletion of the dubious ORF YNL203C, which removes most of the overlapping SPS19 fatty acid \xce\xb2-oxidation gene, was enriched during fermentation (Table S2). These observations suggest that peroxisome-mediated catabolism may adversely affect strain viability during fermentation. Ribosomes are degraded by a specialized form of autophagy termed ribophagy (Kraft and Peter 2008; Kraft et al. 2010). Ribosomes constitute about half of the total cellular protein, therefore their degradation may be a major amino acid source under nutrient-limiting conditions such as fermentation. Both ribosome assembly and protein translation consume energy, so downregulation of these processes might enable cell survival under nutrient-limited conditions. Indeed, we identified a number of heterozygous mutants in genes involved in tRNA synthesis that were enriched during fermentation, supporting this hypothesis (Table S5). Recent studies have implicated the Ubp3 ubiquitin protease, its cofactor Bre5, and the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase in ribophagy (Kraft et al. 2008; Kraft and Peter 2008; Kraft et al. 2009). An intriguing possibility is that some of the ubiquitin-modifying proteins identified in our study may have direct roles in selective autophagy during fermentation. We found that the 26S proteasome is required for fermentation fitness, suggesting that the UPS is important in the adaptive response to fermentation. In agreement with our data, the single ubiquitin encoding gene in yeast, UBI4, is induced during starvation, and overexpression of UBI4 confers ethanol tolerance (Chen and Piper 1995; Finley et al. 1987; Fraser et al. 1991). In addition, UBI4 was identified from a previous small-scale competitive growth screen as being required for stress tolerance during ethanol production (Sharma et al. 2001). This result and the fitness defect of strains disrupted for ubiquitin-specific proteases suggest that ubiquitin itself may be limiting during the extensive proteome and membrane remodeling that occurs during fermentation. The 20S core particle of the 26S proteasome forms a barrel with a stack of four 7-membered rings (2 inner rings formed by \xce\xb2-type subunits and 2 outer rings formed by \xce\xb1-type subunits) (Finley 2009). We identified heterozygous mutants of five \xce\xb2-type subunits (PRE1, PRE2, PRE4, PRE7, PUP1) that had a fitness disadvantage during fermentation (Table 3, Figure 3). In contrast, a heterozygous deletion strain of PRE5, the \xce\xb16 subunit of the proteasome, had a fitness advantage during fermentation (Figure 3, Table S5). The \xce\xb2-type subunits contain the proteolytic-active sites of the proteasome, which could explain why loss of these subunits is more detrimental to cellular fitness during fermentation (Finley 2009). Assembly of a specific isoform of the 20S core particle is regulated by the Pba3/Irc25\xe2\x80\x93Pba4/Poc4 assembly chaperone (Kusmierczyk et al. 2008). Unexpectedly, we detected a fitness defect for the pba4/poc4 heterozygous deletion mutant but a fitness advantage for the pba3/irc25 heterozygous deletion mutant (Figure 3, Table 3, Table S4, Table S5). One intriguing possibility is that alternative forms of the 20S core particle enhance cell fitness during fermentation. Our fitness profiles also revealed a number of other genes with discrete functions that are necessary for optimal growth and survival during fermentation (Table S1, Table S2, Table S3, Table S4, Table S5). In particular, our profiles assigned fermentative phenotypes to 139 uncharacterized genes and 143 dubious ORFs. Most of the dubious ORFs overlap genes with known function, some of which are implicated in autophagy, proteasomal degradation, and ribosome and peroxisome biogenesis. For example, the dubious ORF YMR158W-B, the deletion of which was selected against during fermentation (Figure 1A, Table S1), overlaps with the autophagy gene ATG16. Similarly, the dubious ORF YJL211C, the deletion of which was enriched during fermentation (Table S2), overlaps with the peroxisomal gene PEX2, and the dubious ORF YLR339C, which was enriched in the heterozygous deletion set data, overlaps the essential ribosomal protein RPPO (Table S5). The roles of other uncharacterized genes in fermentation remain to be determined. A heterozygous deletion mutant fitness profiling study was previously reported in nutrient-limiting conditions, including grape juice media (Delneri et al. 2008). We compared our fermentation fitness profiling data to the deletion mutants identified as haploinsufficient (decreased growth rate) and haploproficient (increased growth rate) from the Delneri et al. (2008) dataset. Heterozygous deletion mutants with a fitness disadvantage during fermentation displayed a statistically significant, albeit modest, 2-fold greater overlap than expected by chance with haploinsufficient mutants grown in carbon-limiting, nitrogen-limiting, and grape juice media (Figure S3). With the exception of a minor enrichment in carbon-limiting conditions, no significant overlap was detected between mutants with a fitness advantage during fermentation and haploproficient mutants grown in nutrient-limiting media (Figure S3). One possibility for this lack of overlap is that we performed a closed fermentation under anaerobic conditions, whereas Delneri et al. (2008) grew their mutant pool in continuous cultures in aerobic conditions. The difference in environmental conditions could be why UPS mutants were haploproficient in nitrogen-limiting conditions, whereas we found that UPS mutants had a fitness disadvantage during fermentation. Delneri et al. (2008) postulated that \xe2\x80\x9cprotein conservation may be beneficial\xe2\x80\x9d under nitrogen-limiting conditions, whereas we postulate that protein recycling is beneficial to fermenting cells. We performed an analysis of functional enrichment within the Delneri et al. (2008) datasets and found that, similar to our heterozygous fermentation data, ribosomal proteins were haploproficient in carbon-source\xe2\x80\x93limiting media (Table 5). Therefore, both studies suggest that a decrease in protein production is beneficial to cells under nutrient stress. Indeed, slowing the growth rate of ribosomal mutants in minimal media rescues their growth defect in rich media (Deutschbauer et al. 2005). The comprehensive identification of S. cerevisiae gene function has been hampered to some extent by the use of standard laboratory growth conditions. By subjecting the laboratory yeast deletion strain collection to harsh fermentation conditions, we have uncovered the cellular processes and gene function processes necessary for fitness in this natural environment. The identification of genes required for cellular fitness during fermentation should facilitate the genetic engineering of wine yeast strains that are hypertolerant to the harsh conditions of industrial wine fermentation. Recent global transcription machinery engineering (gTME) demonstrates the feasibility of constructing strains with superior fermentative capacity (Alper et al. 2006). Notably, we identified 33 transcription factor genes that modulate fitness during fermentation (Table S1, Table S2, Table S3, Table S4, Table S5); these factors are candidates for future gTME efforts to create specialized fermentation strains. Similarly, the manipulation of autophagy, peroxisome biogenesis, ubiquitin-dependent protein modification, metabolism, and other processes may enhance the utility of yeast in food, enzyme, and biofuel production.

To identify novel MSUD components, we have developed a high-throughput reverse-genetic screen for use with the N. crassa knockout library. Here we describe the screening method and the characterization of a gene (sad-3) subsequently discovered. SAD-3 is a putative helicase required for MSUD and sexual spore production. It exists in a complex with other known MSUD proteins in the perinuclear region, a center for meiotic silencing activity. Orthologs of SAD-3 include Schizosaccharomyces pombe Hrr1, a helicase required for RNAi-induced heterochromatin formation. Both SAD-3 and Hrr1 interact with an RNA-directed RNA polymerase and an Argonaute, suggesting that certain aspects of silencing complex formation may be conserved between the two fungal species.In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, the incomplete nature of septa (cross walls) allows organelles and other cytoplasmic factors to spread throughout the entire colony (Glass et al. 2000). This lifestyle makes N. crassa especially vulnerable to attack by viruses and other repetitive elements. Perhaps for this reason, several surveillance systems have been established in this fungus. These include quelling (Romano and Macino 1992), repeat-induced point mutation (RIP; Cambareri et al. 1989), and meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD; Shiu et al. 2001). MSUD occurs when homologous genes are not paired during prophase I of meiosis. Such unpairing events can be caused by gene deletions, duplications, and transpositions, for example. Since its discovery, only five MSUD proteins have been identified, and all of them localize in the perinuclear region. These are SAD-1, an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP); DCL-1, a Dicer-like RNase III enzyme; SMS-2, an Argonaute-family protein; SAD-2, a protein regulating SAD-1 localization; and QIP, an exonuclease (Shiu and Metzenberg 2002; Alexander et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2003; Shiu et al. 2006; Xiao et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2010b; Kelly and Aramayo 2007). MSUD appears to involve the production of a single-stranded aberrant RNA from an unpaired segment. This RNA is exported to the perinuclear region where it acts as a template for the SAD-1\xe2\x80\x93mediated double-stranded (ds)RNA synthesis. DCL-1 then processes the dsRNA into small interfering (si)RNA, which guide SMS-2 to identify and slice complementary mRNA. In our working model, SAD-2 is a protein that interacts with SAD-1 and helps transport it to the perinuclear region, whereas QIP is an exonuclease that removes the passenger strand of an siRNA duplex. MSUD efficiency can be assayed by certain ascus (spore sac) or ascospore (meiotic spore) phenotypes in specifically designed testcrosses. Two commonly used phenotypes are ascospore shape and color, which can be manipulated through MSUD with artificial unpairing of the Round spore (r+) gene and the Ascospore maturation-1 (asm-1+) gene, respectively (Shiu et al. 2001). Expression of r+ is required for the production of American football\xe2\x80\x93shaped ascospores, and its unpairing/suppression produces round ascospores. On the other hand, silencing of the asm-1+ gene results in white (inviable) ascospores instead of the normal black-pigmented ones. In previous attempts to identify MSUD suppressors, UV and insertional mutageneses were used in forward genetic screens for mutants that suppress the silencing of unpaired r+ and asm-1+ (Shiu and Metzenberg 2002; Shiu et al. 2006). The two genes discovered through these efforts were sad-1+ and sad-2+. The mutants identified by these methods have a modified sequence of a sad gene that fails to pair with its homolog, thereby creating a self-silencing effect and compromising the silencing mechanism. The identification of SAD-1 as an RdRP pointed to the other hallmark RNAi proteins as potential MSUD players, leading to the discovery of other members of the silencing machinery (SMS-2, DCL-1, and QIP). All of the aforementioned MSUD proteins are required for sexual development, although some are needed at earlier time points than others (e.g., DCL-1 and QIP; Alexander et al. 2008; Xiao et al. 2010). To increase the pace of our MSUD gene discovery, we have utilized an alternative screening method. This system uses a high-throughput reverse-genetic approach, which has been made possible by the construction of the N. crassa knockout library (Colot et al. 2006). This library consists of a genome-wide collection of knockout strains, each represented by a conidial (asexual spore) suspension in 1\xe2\x80\x932 wells (single or both mating types) of a 96-well microtiter plate. The screening of the knockout library for MSUD suppressors involves the transferring of conidia from a library plate to a tester strain cultured in a 96-well plate. The resulting miniature crosses can be analyzed directly with low magnification microscopy. By using this method, it is possible to systematically screen most of the genome for genes that are important for MSUD. Here we present our screening method and its utility with the identification and characterization of a novel MSUD gene sad-3.'","b""In Neurospora crassa, genes lacking a pairing partner during meiosis are suppressed by a process known as meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD).

MSUD tester strains were designed to unpair and silence genes that are important for the ascospore phenotype. Vegetative cultures were maintained on Vogel\xe2\x80\x99s medium (Vogel 1956), and crosses were performed on synthetic crossing medium (SC) of Westergaard and Mitchell (1947). Growth media for strains with auxotrophic markers were supplemented as required (Perkins et al. 2001). To prepare the female testers, 96-well V-bottom microtiter plates (Corning, Lowell, MA) were first filled with molten SC (200 \xc2\xb5l per well). After solidification, a 96-pin replicator was used to transfer mycelia (vegetative cells) from a water suspension of the desired tester strain. The plates were incubated at room temperature, and protoperithecia (female mating structures) were allowed to develop for five days. With the aid of a replicator, protoperithecia were fertilized by transferring conidia from a slightly thawed library plate to the wells of the tester plate. Plates were then placed in humid chamber at room temperature until ascospores could be seen on the lids (\xe2\x88\xbc11 days). A dissecting microscope was then used to determine the ascospore phenotype. r\xce\x94 (F2-29) and asm-1\xce\x94 (F3-23) testers, as well as other control strains, were cultured for 6 days on SC in 60 mm culture plates at room temperature for use as designated females. Conidia from each male were suspended in sterile water and adjusted to a concentration of 1000 counts per microliter. For fertilization, 3 \xc3\x97 33 \xc2\xb5l aliquots of the conidial suspensions were inoculated across the surface of a female tester (in three replicas, each covering roughly the same amount of area). Ascospores were collected from the lids 21 days postfertilization (dpf) and analyzed on a hemocytometer under magnification. Transformations were performed by electroporation of conidia using standard techniques (Margolin et al. 1997). For localization studies, a fluorescent protein tagging protocol based on double-joint PCR was used to construct the sad-3 tagging vectors (Hammond et al. 2011). The primers used in this process are listed in supporting information, Table S1. P8-42 or P8-43 was used as a background strain to create transformants expressing SAD-3 tagged with the green-fluorescent protein (GFP), the N-terminal fragment of the yellow-fluorescent protein (YFPN), or the C-terminal fragment of the YFP (YFPC). Genomic DNA was isolated with the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). PCR-based confirmation of genotypes was performed with the Expand Long Range dNTPack (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). A Canon Power Shot S3 IS digital camera was used to take photographs. The camera was combined with a VanGuard 1231CM or 1274ZH microscope when a sample (e.g., rosettes of asci) required magnification. For fluorescent microscopy, asci were harvested from perithecia (fruiting bodies) and prepared as previously reported (Alexander et al. 2008). Prescreening of crosses for fluorescent signal generation was typically performed with a Zeiss Universal microscope. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM710 microscope. Visualization of the YFP was achieved by using a 514 nm Argon laser line for excitation, and the detector was set to collect emission at 535\xe2\x80\x93600 nm. Protocols for GFP, RFP, and DAPI visualization were essentially as described (Xiao et al. 2010). The high-throughput screen for gene deletions that suppress MSUD is robust, with most crosses producing ascospore levels sufficient for the analysis. Essentially, this method allows up to 96 unique strains to be assayed on a single crossing plate. As an example, Table 2 summarizes the mating success (perithecial level) and cross productivity (ascospore level) between candidates from a library plate and an r\xce\x94 tester. Most of the wells on this plate yielded high levels (\xe2\x88\xbc100%) of round ascospores, typical of an r-silenced cross. However, crosses in wells E8 and E9 each produced low levels of ascospores, with a relatively high percentage (>80%) of American football\xe2\x80\x93shaped progeny. Accordingly, in crosses to an asm-1\xce\x94 tester, where MSUD-proficient strains produced \xe2\x88\xbc100% white inviable ascospores, wells E8 and E9 yielded a relatively high percentage (>25%) of black ascospores. The two positive wells in this case contain opposite mating types of NCU09211\xce\x94. On the off chance that contamination of wells E8 and E9 could have occurred, the NCU09211\xce\x94 strains were crossed to standard wild-type strains to obtain pure homokaryotic progeny. These pure cultures were subsequently used in a thorough characterization. To determine if NCU09211\xce\x94 is truly a suppressor of MSUD, progeny from a cross of NCU09211\xce\x94 a \xc3\x97 fl A were used in a quantitative assay of MSUD suppression. As expected, all MSUD-proficient (negative control) strains yielded nearly 100% round ascospores when crossed to an r\xce\x94 tester (Figure 1A). These include a standard wild-type strain, two wild-type NCU09211+ siblings, and a strain deleted for a non-MSUD gene, csr-1 (Bardiya and Shiu 2007). On the other hand, the two MSUD-deficient (positive control) strains, sad-1\xce\x94 and sad-2\xce\x94, produced mostly American football\xe2\x80\x93shaped ascospores in the same test cross. Crosses of the NCU09211\xce\x94 strains to an r\xce\x94 tester yielded \xe2\x88\xbc20% round spores, a level significantly lower than that of a negative control. Similar results were obtained for crosses of the same strains to an asm-1\xce\x94 tester (Figure 1B). Furthermore, crosses of the NCU09211\xce\x94 strain to two additional MSUD testers, ::act+ and ::bmlR (which induce the unpairing of actin and \xce\xb2-tubulin by an ectopic transgene, respectively), show that it can dominantly suppress their silencing (Table 3). These results demonstrate that the NCU09211\xce\x94 strains used in this study are indeed suppressors of MSUD. NCU09211 is referred to as sad-3+ (suppressor of ascus dominance-3) hereafter. Deletions of sad-3+ (NCU09211) correlate with an MSUD-deficient phenotype. (A) An r\xce\x94 tester (F2-29) was used as the designated female in crosses with eight strains (three replicas each). The four MSUD-proficient controls include two wild-type (WT) siblings (sib) of sad-3\xce\x94 (P16-17 and P16-18), a standard wild-type strain (P3-08), and an hph-based (hygromycin-resistant) deletion strain (csr-1\xce\x94; P8-65). The two experimental strains are sad-3\xce\x94 siblings (P16-19 and P16-20). The two MSUD-deficient controls are sad-1\xce\x94 and sad-2\xce\x94 (P3-25 and P8-02). A normal cross produces black American football (spindle)-shaped ascospores. When MSUD is active, crosses involving an r\xce\x94 tester yield nearly 100% round spores (i.e., r+ is silenced). When MSUD is suppressed (e.g., in crosses involving sad-1, 2, and 3 mutants), the percentage of round spores decreases. Three replicate crosses were performed for each male-female combination. Error bars represent the standard deviation. (B) An asm-1\xce\x94 tester (F3-23) was used as the designated female. When MSUD is active, crosses involving an asm-1\xce\x94 tester yield nearly 100% white (inviable) spores (i.e., asm-1+ is silenced). When MSUD is suppressed (e.g., in crosses involving sad-1, 2, and 3 mutants), the percentage of white spores decreases. The results demonstrate that sad-3\xce\x94, like sad-1\xce\x94 and sad-2\xce\x94, decreases the efficiency of MSUD. Three of the previously discovered MSUD proteins (DCL-1, SAD-1, and SMS-2) have orthologs in other eukaryotes (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe), possibly because they are core components of RNA silencing. Like the aforementioned, SAD-3 also has related proteins in a wide range of organisms (Figure 2). However, except for S. pombe Hrr1 (Motamedi et al., 2004), none of the indicated orthologs has been extensively characterized. A search of NCBI's conserved domain database with the predicted SAD-3 sequence finds two helicase domains, suggesting that SAD-3 may possess the ability to unwind nucleic-acid strands. SAD-3 is a putative eukaryotic helicase. GenBank identification numbers and BLASTP E-values for each protein (relative to Neurospora crassa SAD-3) are as follows: Homo sapiens, GI:28626521, 1e-46; Mus musculus, GI:124487311, 3e-49; Drosophila melanogaster, GI:24649577, 4e-09; Caenorhabditis elegans, GI:17538027, 5e-21; Schizosaccharomyces pombe, GI:19075911, 6e-68. Purple and gray, helicase domains; yellow, zinc finger; green, SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) domain. The previously characterized MSUD genes are all required for sexual development. For example, when both parents of a cross carry either sad-1\xce\x94 or sad-2\xce\x94, perithecia with normal beaks and rosettes with elongated asci are produced, but no ascospores are made (Shiu et al. 2001, 2006). Crosses lacking a functional dcl-1 or qip gene are also barren, but the resulting perithecia have underdeveloped beaks and no recognizable asci (Alexander et al. 2008; Xiao et al. 2010). Our analysis of sad-3\xce\x94 suggests that it is also required for sexual development. Crosses homozygous for sad-3\xce\x94 produce perithecia with normal beaks and elongated asci but no ascospores (Figure 3). In other words, SAD-3 plays an important role in ascospore development. sad-3\xce\x94 \xc3\x97 sad-3\xce\x94 crosses produce perithecia with normal beaks and pigmentation, but no ascospores. Perithecia (left) and their contents (right) are shown for various homozygous crosses (sad-3\xce\x94 and three controls). (A) A WT cross (F5-23 \xc3\x97 P16-17) produces normal perithecia and rosettes of ascospores. (B) A sad-1\xce\x94 cross (F5-24 \xc3\x97 P16-21) produces elongated asci with no ascospores. (C) A sad-3\xce\x94 cross (F5-25 \xc3\x97 P16-20) also produces elongated asci with no ascospores. (D) A qde-1\xce\x94 cross (F5-26 \xc3\x97 P16-22) produces perithecia with underdeveloped beaks and no recognizable asci (right: contents scraped from the inside of the perithecial walls are shown.) qde-1 encodes an RNA polymerase required for vegetative silencing (Quelling; Lee et al. 2010a). To determine the effect of sad-3\xce\x94 on sexual development in heterozygous crosses, ascospore levels were quantified in crosses between sad-3\xce\x94 and wild-type strains. As expected, wild-type crosses yielded abundant ascospores, all within a similar range of 2.4\xe2\x80\x933.3 million ascospores per cross (Figure 4A, B). In contrast, a sad-3\xce\x94 \xc3\x97 WT (wild type) cross produced far fewer progeny (\xe2\x88\xbc0.5 million or 18% of WT level). As a low number of recoverable ascospores in a cross could be due to a defect in spore ejection (and not spore production), rosettes of sad-3\xce\x94 \xc3\x97 WT asci were analyzed. SAD-3 is required for sexual development. (A) Crosses heterozygous for sad-3\xce\x94 produce a low level of shot progeny. The lids [containing ascospores (Asc.)] and crossing plates [containing perithecia (Per.)] from various crosses are shown. A standard female (F2-23) and eight males (same as Figure 1) were used. (B) Quantitative analysis of shot ascospores from crosses depicted in A. Error bars represents the standard deviation among three replicates. (C) Pictures of rosettes from sad-3+ (F2-01) \xc3\x97 sad-3\xce\x94 (P16-19) and from sad-3+ (F2-01) \xc3\x97 sad-3+ (P3-08). Four-spored asci are often observed in a cross heterozygous for sad-3\xce\x94 (arrow). See Figure S1 for additional pictures. (D) Conidia (2 \xc3\x97 104) from WT (P3-07), sad-1\xce\x94 (P8-18), sad-2\xce\x94 (P8-01), and sad-3\xce\x94 (P16-24) were each inoculated onto the center of a 150-mm Vogel\xe2\x80\x99s plate and incubated for seven days at room temperature. There are no obvious morphological differences between WT and any of the MSUD-suppressing (sad) strains in the vegetative phase. Compared with wild-type crosses, rosettes heterozygous for sad-3\xce\x94 produce mostly aborted asci. Asci that are not aborted sometimes contain four large or otherwise deformed ascospores, instead of the normal eight (Figure 4C). This indicates that the low ascospore count in heterozygous crosses is due to a combination of ascus abortion and a reduction in the number of ascospores per ascus. This aspect of sad-3\xce\x94 is interesting in light of the fact that the other characterized MSUD mutant alleles do not appear to affect sexual development dramatically in heterozygous crosses. To ensure these unique results were not due to an unknown (and closely linked) mutation in the sad-3\xce\x94 strains, sad-3+ was deleted independently in two additional strains. Analysis of the new deletion strains showed similar results, confirming that the aberrant sexual phenotypes were due to sad-3\xce\x94 and not to a closely linked mutation (Figure S1). sad-3\xce\x94 strains are normal during the vegetative phase. Linear growth and vegetative morphology assays revealed no significant differences between sad-3\xce\x94 and wild-type strains (Figure 4D and Figure S2). To determine the subcellular localization of its protein product, sad-3 was tagged with the GFP sequence at its native locus. The sad-3-gfp strains are fertile, suggesting the tag does not affect the normal function of SAD-3. Microscopic analysis revealed that SAD-3 is localized in the perinuclear region, similar to the previously characterized MSUD proteins (Figure 5A). To determine if SAD-3 colocalizes with these proteins, an analysis was performed by expressing sad-3-gfp with rfp-tagged versions of sad-1, sad-2, sms-2, and qip in a cross. The results demonstrate that SAD-3 indeed colocalizes with other components of the MSUD machinery (Figure 5). It is conceivable that SAD-3 physically interacts with these proteins and is part of a meiotic silencing complex. SAD-3 colocalizes with SAD-1, SAD-2, SMS-2, and QIP in the perinuclear region. Micrographs illustrate prophase asci expressing (A\xe2\x80\x93D) sad-3-gfp and sad-1-rfp (F4-31 \xc3\x97 P13-59), (E\xe2\x80\x93H) sad-3-gfp and sad-2-rfp (P15-06 \xc3\x97 P15-07), (I\xe2\x80\x93L) sad-3-gfp and sms-2-rfp (P15-08 \xc3\x97 P15-09), and (M\xe2\x80\x93P) sad-3-gfp and qip-rfp (F4-31 \xc3\x97 P13-19). The chromatin was stained with DAPI. Bar, 5 \xce\xbcm. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis is an in vivo assay of protein-protein interactions (Hu et al. 2002). Essentially, two proteins of interest are tagged with nonfunctional fragments of a fluorescent protein (e.g., YFP). If the two tagged proteins are in close proximity (e.g., in the same complex), a functional fluorophore may be reconstituted. Using BiFC, we demonstrated the direct interaction between SAD-1 and SAD-2 (Bardiya et al. 2008), and between QIP and SMS-2 (Hammond et al. 2011). In this study, we have found that SAD-3 interacts with SAD-1, SAD-2, SMS-2, and QIP (Figure 6), giving credence to the notion that these proteins form an RNA-processing complex in the perinuclear region. SAD-3 interacts with SAD-1, SAD-2, SMS-2, and QIP in the perinuclear region. BiFC experiments were performed between SAD-3 (tagged with YFPN, the N-terminal fragment of YFP) and other MSUD proteins (tagged with YFPC). In each case, fluorescent signal was observed in the perinuclear region, suggesting that the tagged MSUD proteins have intimate interaction in vivo that allows the formation of a functional fluorophore. SAD-3-YFPN does not yield a fluorescent signal when YFPC is not attached to a SAD-3\xe2\x80\x93interacting protein. Micrographs illustrate prophase asci expressing (A\xe2\x80\x93C) sad-3-yfpn and sad-1-yfpc (F5-22 \xc3\x97 P7-26), (D\xe2\x80\x93F) sad-3-yfpn and sad-2-yfpc (P15-71 \xc3\x97 P15-72), (G\xe2\x80\x93I) sad-3-yfpn and sms-2-yfpc (P16-12 \xc3\x97 P16-13), (J\xe2\x80\x93L) sad-3-yfpn and qip-yfpc (P16-14 \xc3\x97 P16-15), and (M\xe2\x80\x93O) sad-3-yfpn and yfpc (P16-01 \xc3\x97 P16-16). The chromatin was stained with DAPI. Bar, 5 \xce\xbcm. In this study, we have developed a high-throughput reverse-genetic screen to identify suppressors of MSUD. The methodical gene-by-gene nature of this approach has several advantages over a forward genetic screen (e.g., in time and labor costs). However, this screening method does come with several caveats. First, only annotated genes are included in the knockout library, limiting what can be discovered by this method. Second, some deletions may not suppress MSUD dominantly to a level that is sufficient for detection. Finally, not every compatible fertilization on each plate results in the production of enough ascospores for the visual assay (Table 2). Poor mating or low ascospore count can sometimes result from random technical problems, such as a low medium level in (or poor conidial transfer to) a given well. These potential problems suggest that there may be considerable value in performing multiple screens for each library plate. SAD-3 is a helicase-domain protein required for MSUD. Loss of sad-3+ by gene deletion is sufficient to induce a dominant MSUD suppression phenotype in crosses to four different MSUD tester strains (each containing a rearranged sexual development gene). This dominant suppression can be explained by the \xe2\x80\x9csilencing-the-silencer\xe2\x80\x9d model first proposed by Shiu et al. (2001). In this case, a sad-3\xce\x94 \xc3\x97 sad-3+ cross results in the unpairing of sad-3+ during meiosis, which makes it a target for silencing by the MSUD machinery. Because sad-3+ is part of the MSUD machinery, its suppression leads to a negative feedback and the eventual defeat of the silencing mechanism. The finding of sad-3\xce\x94 being an overall weaker dominant suppressor of MSUD (compared with sad-1\xce\x94 and sad-2\xce\x94) may suggest that sad-3\xce\x94 is a less capable \xe2\x80\x9cself-silencer\xe2\x80\x9d than the others are. However, suppression strength in the \xe2\x80\x9csilencing-the-silencer\xe2\x80\x9d assay may be related to the expression profile of each MSUD gene and its product, including protein/mRNA turnover rates and expression timing. It is not necessarily an indicator of the importance of a SAD protein to the mechanism. Interestingly, despite the lower strength of MSUD suppression, dramatic sexual defects were observed in heterozygous sad-3\xce\x94 \xc3\x97 sad-3+ crosses, an observation unique among all reported MSUD genes to date. All of the MSUD proteins characterized thus far, including SAD-3, show a perinuclear localization pattern. It seems possible that they form a silencing complex in the perinuclear region, which inspects (and if necessary, processes) RNA molecules as they exit the nucleus. This hypothesis is consistent with the colocalization and BiFC results demonstrated in this and previous studies. Based on the identity of the proteins involved and what we have learned to date, a simple model for MSUD is depicted as follows (Figure 7A). Briefly, recognition of unpaired DNA leads to the production of an aberrant RNA, which is made double-stranded (by SAD-1) and processed into siRNA (by DCL-1) capable of directing mRNA degradation (by SMS-2). SAD-3, a putative helicase, may assist SAD-1 in dsRNA synthesis by increasing its processivity on RNA templates. QIP functions to degrade the passenger strand of an siRNA duplex, whereas SAD-2 may serve as a scaffolding protein and assemble the necessary components in the perinuclear region. A working model for MSUD (see text for details). (A) An unpaired gene triggers the production of an aberrant (a)RNA molecule that is destined for the perinuclear region, a region surrounding the nucleus (dotted line). There, the aRNA is made double-stranded (SAD-1/SAD-3) and processed into siRNA (DCL-1), which are subsequently used to destroy complementary mRNA (QIP/SMS-2). (B) An MSUD complex (as suggested by our BiFC results) is shown interacting with different RNA molecules. SAD-2 is responsible for recruiting SAD-1 (and possibly others) to the perinuclear region. Red, aRNA; green, newly synthesized RNA; black, siRNA; purple, mRNA. S. pombe Hrr1 is a SAD-3 ortholog required for RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation (Motamedi et al. 2004). It is a component of the RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex (RDRC) that also includes Rdp1 (an RdRP) and Cid12 (a polyA polymerase family member). RDRC interacts with the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing complex (RITS), which is comprised of the Ago1 Argonaute (an SMS-2 ortholog) and two other proteins. The model for RDRC/RITS assembly involves an RdRP-helicase-Argonaute interaction. This mirrors our BiFC results, which suggest an interaction between SAD-1 and SAD-3, and between SAD-3 and SMS-2. It seems plausible that the complex formations that mediate MSUD and RNAi-induced heterochromatin assembly are related to some degree.

6,"['Minori Shinya', 'Noriyoshi Sakai']","October 4, 2011.",Generation of Highly Homogeneous Strains of Zebrafish Through Full Sib-Pair Mating,"b'Genetically homogeneous populations, such as inbred strains, are powerful experimental tools that are ideally suited for studying immunology, cancer, and genetics of complex traits. The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has been underutilized in these research areas because homogeneous strains of experimental fish have not been available in tractable condition. Here, we attempted to inbreed two zebrafish wild-type strains, T\xc3\xbcbingen and India, through full sib-pair mating. Although the inbred T\xc3\xbcbingen strain failed to thrive and was lost after 13 generations, an inbred India strain (IM) has been maintained successfully. The IM strain has endured 16 generations of inbreeding and has maintained a healthy condition. Two additional strains, IM12m and IM14m, were established as closed colonies from the branches of the IM strain. Genotype analyses using genetic markers revealed a dramatic decrease in polymorphisms (62% dropped to 5%) in both IM (generation 14) and the two closed colonies. This indicates a high level of homogeneity in these strains. Furthermore, scale transplantations between individuals within each strain were successful. These data suggest that extremely homogeneous zebrafish strains have been established, thereby creating a valuable resource for practical application.Genetically uniform strains of animals are valuable tools in biomedical research. Multiple laboratories can use these strains without concern that genetic background variability will confound the experimental results. Indeed, genetic background often affects phenotypes associated with a particular mutant or experimental manipulation in several organisms (Anzai et al. 2010; Nojima et al. 2004; Nomura 1991; Yamamura et al. 2001). In such cases, genetically isogenic strains that can be maintained for generations play an important role in providing highly reproducible results (even several or more years later), and enable us to directly compare and evaluate results obtained from multiple laboratories. Genetically homogeneous strains also provide essential tools for the identification of quantitative loci that affect evolutionarily and biomedically important traits (Frankel 1995; Kimura et al. 2007; Klingenberg et al. 2004; Klingenberg et al. 2001; Tomida et al. 2009; Xiao et al. 2010). Extremely reliable and reproducible data obtained from genetically homogeneous model organisms enable the dissection of both gene-gene and gene-environmental interaction patterns. Furthermore, to identify the susceptible genes, it is often necessary to generate congenic strains; strains that differ from their inbred partner strain by only a short chromosomal segment. The stably maintained homogeneous strain makes it possible to backcross continuously to generate congenic strains (Markel et al. 1997; Morel et al. 1996; Yui et al. 1996). Numerous attributes in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, including large numbers of eggs per clutch, a short generation time, and relatively low costs associated with maintenance, enable the application of a wide variety of biological techniques to the organism, such as embryonic manipulations, forward and reverse genetics, and molecular biology. Consequently, over the past two decades, the zebrafish has become an important vertebrate model organism in developmental biology, neuroscience, and cancer research. However, the zebrafish system has one major weakness; namely, the lack of highly homogeneous strains that can be stably maintained for many generations. For example, in both mice and medaka, over 10 inbred strains have been maintained by full sib-pair mating for more than 20 generations; these strains have expanded the use of these animals as vertebrate model systems (Naruse et al. 2004; Peters et al. 2007). Comparable zebrafish inbred strains have not been available to the scientific community. Streisinger et al. (1981) demonstrated that gynogenesis could be used to produce homozygous diploid fish in which only the maternal genome is represented in the offspring. Two zebrafish strains, C32 and SJD, were generated in this manner and were subsequently inbred for a number of generations (Johnson et al. 1995; Nechiporuk et al. 1999; Streisinger et al. 1981). Genetic analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed that 7% and 11% of tested loci were polymorphic in the SJD and C32 strains, respectively (Guryev et al. 2006). As 14.1% of these SNPs were polymorphic in an outbred strain, WIK, it is difficult to conclude that SJD and C32 truly represent homogeneous lines (Guryev et al. 2006). Recently, several additional clonal zebrafish strains have been generated by gynogenesis. Successful transplantations between adult fish have been performed with these strains without severe immune reactions (Mizgirev and Revskoy 2010). It is too early to know, however, whether these strains can be maintained and expanded over many generations. Finally, there is an additional inbred strain, SJA, which is listed in the Zebrafish Model Organism Database (ZFIN, Bradford et al. 2011). It is unclear how SJA was created, however, and only 85% of its genome is guaranteed to be monomorphic. It is clear that some logistical difficulties (i.e., inbreeding depressions), including high mortality levels of embryos and larvae, biased sex ratio, and few eggs from natural crosses, have made it hard to inbreed zebrafish. However, it is not clear whether these difficulties are too severe to establish and maintain homogeneous strains in zebrafish. In this study, we have inbred two zebrafish wild-type strains, attempting to know the severity of inbreeding depression in zebrafish and to establish highly homogeneous zebrafish strains through continuous full sib-pair mating.'","b'Genetically homogeneous populations, such as inbred strains, are powerful experimental tools that are ideally suited for studying immunology, cancer, and genetics of complex traits.

This indicates a high level of homogeneity in these strains. Furthermore, scale transplantations between individuals within each strain were successful. These data suggest that extremely homogeneous zebrafish strains have been established, thereby creating a valuable resource for practical application. Genetically uniform strains of animals are valuable tools in biomedical research. Multiple laboratories can use these strains without concern that genetic background variability will confound the experimental results. Indeed, genetic background often affects phenotypes associated with a particular mutant or experimental manipulation in several organisms (Anzai et al. 2010; Nojima et al. 2004; Nomura 1991; Yamamura et al. 2001). In such cases, genetically isogenic strains that can be maintained for generations play an important role in providing highly reproducible results (even several or more years later), and enable us to directly compare and evaluate results obtained from multiple laboratories. Genetically homogeneous strains also provide essential tools for the identification of quantitative loci that affect evolutionarily and biomedically important traits (Frankel 1995; Kimura et al. 2007; Klingenberg et al. 2004; Klingenberg et al. 2001; Tomida et al. 2009; Xiao et al. 2010). Extremely reliable and reproducible data obtained from genetically homogeneous model organisms enable the dissection of both gene-gene and gene-environmental interaction patterns. Furthermore, to identify the susceptible genes, it is often necessary to generate congenic strains; strains that differ from their inbred partner strain by only a short chromosomal segment. The stably maintained homogeneous strain makes it possible to backcross continuously to generate congenic strains (Markel et al. 1997; Morel et al. 1996; Yui et al. 1996). Numerous attributes in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, including large numbers of eggs per clutch, a short generation time, and relatively low costs associated with maintenance, enable the application of a wide variety of biological techniques to the organism, such as embryonic manipulations, forward and reverse genetics, and molecular biology. Consequently, over the past two decades, the zebrafish has become an important vertebrate model organism in developmental biology, neuroscience, and cancer research. However, the zebrafish system has one major weakness; namely, the lack of highly homogeneous strains that can be stably maintained for many generations. For example, in both mice and medaka, over 10 inbred strains have been maintained by full sib-pair mating for more than 20 generations; these strains have expanded the use of these animals as vertebrate model systems (Naruse et al. 2004; Peters et al. 2007). Comparable zebrafish inbred strains have not been available to the scientific community. Streisinger et al. (1981) demonstrated that gynogenesis could be used to produce homozygous diploid fish in which only the maternal genome is represented in the offspring. Two zebrafish strains, C32 and SJD, were generated in this manner and were subsequently inbred for a number of generations (Johnson et al. 1995; Nechiporuk et al. 1999; Streisinger et al. 1981). Genetic analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed that 7% and 11% of tested loci were polymorphic in the SJD and C32 strains, respectively (Guryev et al. 2006). As 14.1% of these SNPs were polymorphic in an outbred strain, WIK, it is difficult to conclude that SJD and C32 truly represent homogeneous lines (Guryev et al. 2006). Recently, several additional clonal zebrafish strains have been generated by gynogenesis. Successful transplantations between adult fish have been performed with these strains without severe immune reactions (Mizgirev and Revskoy 2010). It is too early to know, however, whether these strains can be maintained and expanded over many generations. Finally, there is an additional inbred strain, SJA, which is listed in the Zebrafish Model Organism Database (ZFIN, Bradford et al. 2011). It is unclear how SJA was created, however, and only 85% of its genome is guaranteed to be monomorphic. It is clear that some logistical difficulties (i.e., inbreeding depressions), including high mortality levels of embryos and larvae, biased sex ratio, and few eggs from natural crosses, have made it hard to inbreed zebrafish. However, it is not clear whether these difficulties are too severe to establish and maintain homogeneous strains in zebrafish. In this study, we have inbred two zebrafish wild-type strains, attempting to know the severity of inbreeding depression in zebrafish and to establish highly homogeneous zebrafish strains through continuous full sib-pair mating. Two outbred wild-type strains, India and T\xc3\xbcbingen, were used to generate genetically homogeneous strains of zebrafish. The India strain is a strain obtained from expedition to Darjeeling (see ZFIN at http://zfin.org/action/genotype/genotype-detail?zdbID=ZDB-GENO-980210-28). The T\xc3\xbcbingen strain originated from a local pet shop and was maintained for many generations in the laboratory at T\xc3\xbcbingen (Haffter et al. 1996). This strain has been used by the Sanger Institute for the Danio rerio Sequencing Project. The two inbreeding strains were named IM (India-Mishima) and TM (T\xc3\xbcbingen-Mishima). For the IM strain, male and female fish of generation n were denoted In-M# and In-F#, respectively (# represents the serial number). An IM pair (consisting of one male and one female) within generation n was denoted In-#. For example, the IM founder pair (I0-1) consisted of one male (I0-M1) and one female (I0-F1). The same nomenclature was applied to TM fish, with a \xe2\x80\x9cT\xe2\x80\x9d replacing the \xe2\x80\x9cI.\xe2\x80\x9d The method for fish breeding is described in supporting information, File S1. To generate genetically homogeneous zebrafish strains, sister-brother mating was performed for many consecutive generations. A basic strategy for inbreeding is schematically represented in Figure 1. Typically, five males and five females were selected from offspring obtained from a single pair of parents. Five single-pair matings were established from them, and embryos from each pair were raised to adulthood. To determine which pair\xe2\x80\x99s offspring was intercrossed to generate the next generation, the following criteria were used: (1) average number of eggs laid; (2) fertilization efficiency; (3) average number of embryos surviving until three days postfertilization (dpf); (4) survival rate of embryos at three dpf; (5) normal development in the most embryos; (6) normal growth into healthy adult fish in the most larvae; and (7) sex ratio. If most pairs of a given generation revealed problems in any of these parameters, additional pairs were generated, and the process was repeated. Paired fish of generation n were fixed in 100% ethanol and placed at \xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xb0 after confirmation that their offspring were producing viable progeny (generation n + 2). If a paired fish was found dead before this confirmation was possible, the deceased fish was fixed in 100% ethanol and immediately placed at \xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xb0. Closed colonies from two distinct branches of the IM family were maintained through mass-mating of healthy-looking females and males (three to eight each). Significant differences between the fertility data at generation n and those at generation 0 were tested by t-test. Schematic representation of typical inbreeding strategy. (1) Five pairs at generation n (Gn) were generated from offspring originated from a single pair of fish at generation n-1 (Gn-1). (2) Embryos (Gn+1) from each pairs were obtained and raised to adulthood. Data corresponding to the fertility of each pair were recorded. (3) The best pair at generation n (pair 1 in this figure) was determined based on the fertility data (see Materials and Methods for detailed criteria). (4) Inbreeding was repeated from (1) for the next generation; i.e., five pairs at generation n + 1 (Gn+1) were generated from the offspring of the best pair at generation n. During the course of the experiment, the fish were genotyped to monitor genetic homogeneity and to guard against contamination. Genotyping was performed using the simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLP) listed on the ZFIN web site. Positional information for each marker was obtained from ZFIN and the Massachusetts General Hospital Zebrafish server (Shimoda et al. 1999). The allele size of each SSLP marker was determined for both TM and IM founder pairs (generation 0), and markers that were polymorphic in the original pair were identified. Furthermore, using four progeny from each strain (generation 1), codominant inheritance of the selected markers was confirmed. Genomic DNA was extracted from fin-clips of living fish or one-quarter of an ethanol-fixed fish using the Maxwell 16 Automated Purification System (Promega, Tokyo, Japan). Each fish\xe2\x80\x99s genotype was determined using methods described in Kimura et al. (2005), with some modifications. Two fish were anesthetized using 0.01% ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (w/v) and placed on a wet Kimwipe with the lateral side up. For autotransplantation, one dorsal and one ventral scale were removed using forceps. The dorsal scale then was inserted into the ventral position (where the ventral scale had just been removed). For transplantations between individuals, one dorsal scale from the donor fish was inserted into the ventral region of the recipient fish. Dorsal scales contain melanophores and, therefore, are easily identified within the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s nonpigmented ventral region. The day after transplantation, the presence of the donor scale was confirmed. If the transplanted scale was missing at this time, the operation was deemed a failure. Between posttransplantation days 3 and 24, the transplanted scale was checked frequently (posttransplantation days 3 to 9, every two days; posttransplantation days 10\xe2\x80\x9324, every three days) to monitor for allograft rejection. Significant differences between autotransplantation and transplantations between individuals were tested by Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s exact test. T\xc3\xbcbingen is a heterogeneous, wild-type strain of zebrafish, and in April 2005, inbreeding was initiated with three independent single-pair matings (generation 0) (Figure 2A). Complete fertility records for each pair in each generation are shown in Table S1. The first obstacle to inbreeding arose in generation 2 (Figure 3C, E, G, I). At this point, the average number of fertilized eggs per clutch was 56 (the lowest value measured during the study, except for the value in generation 13), and the fertilization efficiency was only 43.2%, significantly lower than the value at generation 0. At three dpf, the number of living embryos and the survival rate (each measured on a per clutch basis) also were quite low (46 and 62.5%, respectively), although the differences were not significant compared to the data at the beginning of the inbreeding. In this generation, 8 of 10 pairs yielded less than 50 living embryos at three dpf per clutch. Because of generation 2\xe2\x80\x99s fertility problems, additional pair matings were established from generation 1 fish, and two subfamily branches (one originating from T1-4 and the other from T1-5) were maintained (Figure 2A). Because of these difficulties, it took approximately five months to establish the next generation successfully, whereas the typical zebrafish generation time is three months (Laale 1977) (Figure 2A). After generation 4, no additional major problems arose, and the TM strain was successfully propagated until generation 11 (Figures 2A and 3). The body size and lifespan seemed the same as that of the original strain, although most TM fish were usually disposed of after around one year to save space in the fish facility. However, a biased sex ratio was observed in pair matings of generation 2 (T2-2, T2-3, and T2-8), generation 5 (T5-1, T5-4), and generation 6 (T6-2). In each case, the progeny from the crosses were predominantly male. Pedigree of the highly homogeneous strains. (A) Pedigree of the TM strain. (B) Pedigree of the IM strain. Bolded paired identifiers represent the pair whose offspring were kept inbreeding. Single-underlined paired identifiers represent pairs that produced some embryos with the TM phenotype, whereas double-underlined paired identifiers represent pairs that only produced embryos with the TM phenotype. Two closed colonies (IM12m and IM14m) were established from the pairs in boxes. Fertility of the TM and IM strains at each generation.

Asterisks indicate the significant differences (P < 0.05) from the values observed in generation 0. The second major difficulty arose in generation 12 of the TM strain. Most pairs of generation 12 produced embryos with phenotypes that included a small head, an underdeveloped lower jaw, and poor circulation (Figure 4). These phenotypes were collectively designated the \xe2\x80\x9cTM phenotype.\xe2\x80\x9d Embryos with the TM phenotype died within 10 dpf from cell necrosis within the brain or starvation or both. As a result, additional single-pair matings were established from generation 12 fish. Pairs T12-8, T12-15, and T12-16 produced phenotypically normal embryos, whereas T12-4 produced both normal embryos and embryos with the TM phenotype (Figure 2A, Table S1). The remaining 12 single-pair matings, however, only produced embryos with the TM phenotype. Normal embryos obtained from the above single-pair matings were raised to adulthood. Unfortunately, the T12-15 and T12-16 progeny were all male. In generation 13, therefore, only fish from T12-4 and T12-8 were available for sib-pair mating (Figure 2A). All progeny from generation 13, however, exhibited the TM phenotype. In a final attempt to overcome this problem, additional single-pair matings were established from generation 11 (T11-6 and T11-7). Embryos from these crosses appeared normal and healthy; however, all T11-7 progeny were male, and the T11-6 progeny did not produce any fertilized eggs. Therefore, despite much effort, inbreeding of the TM strain ended at generation 13. The TM phenotype. Embryos with the TM phenotype had small heads and underdeveloped jaws. Lateral views of the embryos are shown. (A, B) Wild-type embryo. (C, D) TM embryo with the TM phenotype. (E, F) IM embryo with the TM phenotype. Arrowheads mark the underdeveloped jaws. Scale bar is 0.7 mm. Inbreeding of the IM strain began in August 2005 (Figure 2B). India is a wild-type strain that has been used often as the reference line for mapping mutations (Geisler 2002). Inbreeding of India fish was initiated with five single-pair matings (generation 0). Complete fertility records for each pair in each generation are shown in Table S2. Successful progression from one generation to the next took between two-and-one-half and four months for IM (Figure 2B), indicating a relatively smooth inbreeding process. As with TM, the fertilization efficiency of the IM strain decreased soon after the inbreeding process was initiated. IM efficiency remained significantly low (approximately 50%, Figure 3F). In contrast, TM fertilization efficiency had recovered by generation 6. However, because IM females tended to lay more eggs than TM females (Figure 3A, B), the number of fertilized eggs and surviving embryos at three dpf were mostly higher in IM compared with TM (Figure 3C, D, G, H). Furthermore, although the value was still significantly lower than that of generation 0, the fertilization efficiency of IM suddenly increased to \xe2\x88\xbc80% at generation 15, providing hope that this parameter may improve in subsequent generations. The survival rate at three dpf did not vary much during the course of the experiment (Figure 3J). Surprisingly, one pair (I14-2) produced embryos with a phenotype indistinguishable from the TM phenotype (Figure 2B, compare Figure 4E, F with Figure 4C, D). Therefore, we established additional single-pair matings using IM fish from some pairs in generation 13 (I13-2, I13-4, and I13-5). To be safe, generation 15 single-pair matings were prepared from I14-3, which had different parents than I14-2 (Figure 2B). Phenotypically wild-type embryos were obtained from all generation 15 pairs, and the progeny, the IM fish of generation 16, have been growing well. During earlier stages of the IM inbreeding process, there were examples of unbalanced sex ratios. I3-1, I3-2, and I7-1 produced primarily male progeny; however, this did not develop into a persistent problem. In addition, generation 15 and generation 16 fish generally looked a little bit smaller than fish of their original strain, but they appeared healthy in all other ways and consistently produced fertilized eggs without artificial insemination. Just like fish in the India strain, their original strain, most of IM fish were usually in good condition until they were disposed of to surrender space (about one year, normally). We will continue to propagate the IM strain through sib-pair matings. As was learned from the TM strain, continuous sib-pair mating carried the risk of strain extermination. To avoid complete loss of the genetically homogeneous IM strain, therefore, we also established two IM branch families and maintained them as closed colonies. I12-4 and I14-3 served as founder pairs of these colonies (Figure 2B), and they were named IM12m and IM14m, respectively. These strains have been successfully propagated for two to four generations by mass mating. To monitor inbreeding progress and to avoid strain contamination, the pairs whose progeny was crossed in the next generation were frequently used in a genetic analysis. Each fish was genotyped using two genetic markers per chromosome (50 markers in all). These 50 markers were prepared for the TM and IM strains as listed in Table S3 and Table S4, respectively. Polymorphic markers in founder fish were included in the marker sets as much as possible. In generation 0 of the TM and IM strains, polymorphisms were detected at 52% and 84% of the examined loci, respectively (Table 1). By generation 9, the number of polymorphic makers had decreased to 12% (TM) and 8% (IM), indicating a dramatic loss of genetic diversity. In the TM strain, 8% of the markers were polymorphic at generation 11, whereas in IM, only 2% of the markers were polymorphic by generation 13. No unexpected alleles were detected in this analysis, suggesting a lack of contamination during the inbreeding process. To determine more precisely which genomic regions remained polymorphic within the IM strain, an additional 50 genetic markers were analyzed. This \xe2\x80\x9cadditional marker set\xe2\x80\x9d contained two more markers per chromosome than the original IM marker set. The I14-3 pair, which consisted of I14-M3 and I14-F3, was chosen for this analysis. In addition, three fish from IM14m that had been mass-mated for two generations (IM14m2), three fish from IM12m that had been mass-mated for one generation (IM12m1), and three fish from IM12m that had been mass-mated for three generations (IM12m3) were included in the analysis. The 100 markers covered the zebrafish genome with an average interval of 19.4 \xc2\xb1 12.3 cM. The alleles found in these fish are shown in Table 2. At generation 0, 62% of the markers were polymorphic, whereas only 5% were polymorphic in I14-3 (Table 1) and IM12m1 (data not shown). Alleles that remained polymorphic at late stages of inbreeding included: Z6802 at LG1; Z191 at LG7; Z6867 at LG8; Z6895 at LG15; and Z4003 at LG23. Four of the five markers (except for Z6895 at LG15) also were polymorphic in IM12m3. In addition, four of the five markers (except for Z6867 at LG8) were polymorphic in IM14m2. For each of these IM strains, therefore, \xe2\x88\xbc95% of the genome was homozygous. As such, we have successfully generated highly inbred and genetically homogeneous strains of zebrafish by sequential sib-pair mating. As with other animals, adult zebrafish that are part of an outbred colony reject transplanted tissue from another individual (Figure 5B). In mice, however, successful tissue transplantation between individuals occurs if the two mice originated from the same inbred strain (Medina 2010). Similar results have been seen in medaka after 8 generations of sib-pair mating (Hyodo-Taguchi and Egami 1985). To test whether tissue transplantation between adult individuals was possible in zebrafish strains inbred for many generations, scale transplantation experiments were performed (Figure 5A). IM animals from generations 14 and 16, as well as IM12m1, were chosen for analysis. In autograft experiments (in which a dorsal scale is place in a ventral region of the same individual), 86\xe2\x80\x93100% of the autografted scales remained at the transplanted region 24 days after transplantation (Figure 5B\xe2\x80\x93D). In contrast, most grafts between individuals of the outbred India strain were rejected and, therefore, not detected except for one scale at 24 days after transplantation (Figure 5B, P = 0.005 by Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s exact test). When scales were transplanted between IM individuals (generation 14), 78% of the scales survived 24 days (Figure 5C); this did not represent a significant difference from autograft experiments (P = 0.527 by Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s exact test). For both I16 (Figure 5D) and IM12m1 (data not shown), no grafted scales were rejected (P = 1 by Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s exact test). These strains of zebrafish inbred for 12 or more generations are, therefore, sufficiently homogeneous to support transplantation of cells between adult individuals. Scale transplantation experiments. (A) Schematic representation of scale transplantation. A dorsal scale was always transplanted to the ventral side. The \xe2\x80\x9cdiff\xe2\x80\x9d (black arrows) indicates transplantation between individuals, and \xe2\x80\x9cauto\xe2\x80\x9d (gray arrows) indicates transplantation within the same fish. (B\xe2\x80\x93D) The percentage of surviving transplanted scales during the 24 days after transplantation. Crosses indicate autotransplantation, and diamonds indicate transplantation between individuals. Transplantation data from the India outbred strain (B), IM fish at generation 14 (C), and IM fish at generation 16 (D) are shown. P-values were calculated from the data at 24 days after transplantation. In this study, we inbred two wild-type zebrafish strains, TM and IM, by full sib-pair mating. Although the TM strain was lost after 13 generations, the IM strain successfully produced offspring from pairs at generation 15; that is, the IM strain endured 16 generations of sib-pair mating. Furthermore, two additional strains (IM12m and IM14m) were established as closed colonies. Genotype analysis revealed that polymorphisms associated with the IM founder pair (62% of the interrogated genetic markers) were dramatically reduced (5%) in IM, IM12m, and IM14m. These data suggest a high level of genetic homogeneity within each strain. In fact, allograft rejection was not observed between individuals within these strains. Together, the IM, IM12m, and IM14m strains represent important resources for the zebrafish scientific community, particularly in the fields of complex trait analysis. Furthermore, the inbreeding strategy described here will be a good reference to establish more strains of zebrafish that are highly homogeneous. Those strains are available from M. Shinya by request. The genetic analysis of SSLP markers showed that the genomes of the IM, IM12m, and IM14m strains were \xe2\x88\xbc95% nonpolymorphic (Tables 1 and 2). The coefficient of inbreeding is the probability that two alleles at a randomly chosen locus in an individual are identical by descents, and it is theoretically calculated as 0.951 for an individual generated by full sib-pair mating for 14 generations (Falconer 1989). Therefore, our estimation that \xe2\x88\xbc95% of the genomes were homozygous in the IM and its related strains is consistent with the theoretical value, even though we examined only 100 loci. To determine more precisely the degree of polymorphism within these strains, it will be necessary to genotype more genetic markers, including SNPs. Alternatively, direct sequencing of these strains will provide the most accurate assessment of genetic homogeneity. In this regard, we have begun sequencing two genomes from I14-3 (I14-M3 and I14-F3), which will identify polymorphisms within the IM strain. Highly homogeneous strains of zebrafish are typically difficult to manipulate and maintain. Problems associated with these strains include physiological weakness, biased sex ratios, and the inability to perform natural crosses. Homozygous diploid zebrafish lines C32 and SJD (Johnson et al. 1995; Streisinger et al. 1981) were shown to be homozygous in over 90% of genomes through SSLP marker analyses (Nechiporuk et al. 1999). Unfortunately, C32 lacked vigor, and SJD progeny were predominantly male. Reciprocal introgression of genes to overcome these phenotypes was attempted by crossing C32 and SJD (Rawls et al. 2003). The IM strain and two related closed colonies were shown to be \xe2\x88\xbc95% homozygous. As a result, they are somewhat weaker physiologically than heterogeneous populations (e.g., lower tolerance for sudden changes to pH or temperature). These weaknesses, however, have not hindered their propagation or maintenance. Furthermore, all three strains are capable of laying fertilized eggs under natural-cross conditions. While inbreeding IM, we occasionally observed biased sex ratios. In generations 3 and 7, some pairs predominantly yielded males (see Results), but after generation 8, no further gender bias was detected. No sex ratio bias has been seen for either IM12m or IM14m. Taken together, IM strains do not exhibit the phenotypic weaknesses that typically plague homogeneous populations of zebrafish. Careful selection for those phenotypes in each generation may have contributed to this successful outcome. The genetic homogeneity and health condition of IM, IM12m, and IM14m make them ideally suited for experimental manipulation. Testicular cell grafting experiments have already been performed using these strains (Kawasaki et al. 2010). To effectively utilize these strains in genetic analyses of quantitative traits, however, it will be necessary to generate at least one additional inbred strain from a different genetic background (i.e., not India). We have begun additional inbreeding by following the inbreeding strategy described here with some modifications to attempt to generate more homogeneous lines from other zebrafish wild-type strains. TM inbreeding failed at generation 13 because of the TM phenotype (Figure 4). This phenotype arose so suddenly and with such a high frequency (almost every embryo from generation 12 breeding pairs was affected) (Figure 2A) that propagation of the line was not possible. Although TM and IM were raised under essentially identical conditions, the TM phenotype primarily affected only one line. It is likely, therefore, that a genetic factor(s) caused this condition. Phenotypes associated with maternal contributions often arise quickly, but the TM phenotype does not seem to be inherited maternally. One female (T12-F13) produced embryos with the TM phenotype when crossed with T12-M13 but yielded wild-type embryos when crossed with T12-M14 (Table S1). The pattern of phenotypic appearance within the TM family (rapid and essentially ubiquitous) makes it difficult to explain this phenomenon with a single factor. Many factors (perhaps including environmental factors) may have been involved in the phenotypic expression. Genomic comparisons between zebrafish parents that produce embryos with either the wild-type or TM phenotype may lead to identify the causative loci. As we have sampled most pairs for DNA preparation, we are now planning to perform the genomic analyses using those samples to elucidate the genetic basis of the TM phenotype. The TM phenotype was also seen in a single cross of the IM strain, which was derived from a completely different genetic background. Furthermore, similar phenotypes have been observed in another wild-type strain, AB, which was established long ago in Oregon (H. Yokoi, personal communication). These observations suggest that the TM phenotype is generally associated with increased homozygosity of the zebrafish genome. \xe2\x80\x9cInbreeding depression\xe2\x80\x9d is a term used to describe the reduced fitness of a given population that results from breeding related individuals (Charlesworth and Willis 2009). The TM phenotype exemplifies inbreeding depression. Then, in addition to the inbreeding problems described above, how to cope with the TM phenotype is an important issue to establish inbred strains in zebrafish. One way to avoid extinction caused by TM phenotype is the way taken in the IM inbreeding at generation 14: generating many branches and for the next generation, selecting a single-mating pair whose parents are different from those of pairs with TM phenotype (Figure 2B). Alternatively, we can avoid the phenotype, if the causative loci are identified. In this sense, the genomic analyses proposed above will provide a big help to establish inbred strains in zebrafish more easily. Inbreeding depression presents a major difficulty in generating and maintaining highly homogeneous strains. The degree of inbreeding depression varies from species to species. Quail, for example, exhibit remarkably strong inbreeding depression (Sato 1986). The lethal equivalent (LE) is an index that attempts to quantify inbreeding depression. An LE is defined as a set of alleles that would cumulatively cause an individual to fail to produce its offspring, if all alleles in the set are homozygous in the individual (Morton et al. 1956). The number of LEs in quail has been estimated at 8.7 (Sittmann et al. 1966), whereas values of 1.4 to 3.6 LEs have been reported for zebrafish (McCune et al. 2002; McCune et al. 2004). It seems clear, therefore, that zebrafish exhibit less inbreeding depression than birds, a fact that contributed to the success of our IM project. In both mice and medaka, inbreeding depression is weak enough to allow 20 or more generations of continuous sib-pair mating. However, there is a clear difference between these two species. Inbred strains of medaka are generated quite easily, as only two to three single-pair matings are typically established and tested per generation (Taguchi 1980). In contrast, sibling crosses in mice generate many sterile animals and require numerous single-pair matings at each generation, especially the first generation (Silver 1995). This inbreeding depression typically begins to diminish by generation 8. Therefore, inbreeding depression is stronger in mice than in medaka. In this study, we typically established five single-pair matings per generation. Although we lost one strain, IM remains maintained by continuous sib-pair mating. These data suggest that inbreeding depression in zebrafish is greater than in medaka but like",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

y less than in mice. Inbreeding depression is caused by increased homozygosity for a single locus with heterozygous advantages and/or a single or multiple deleterious mutations with recessive effects (reviewed in Charlesworth and Willis 2009). It is interesting and important to identify the genomic factors involved in inbreeding depression and in its variation among species. Although some genetic analyses have been performed for the traits related to fitness (Remington and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley 2000), they have not identified those factor(s) yet. Together with the quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses for the fitness traits, genomic sequencing analyses using TM and IM fish in some generations might give some insights into the factor(s) related to inbreeding depression. Those kinds of data from several organisms will provide information about the genomic factor(s) that contribute to the variation of inbreeding depression among those species. In mice and rats, an inbred strain is defined as a population that was established with a single ancestral pair and has been inbred (brother \xc3\x97 sister) for 20 or more consecutive generations (Guidelines for Nomenclature of Mouse and Rat Strains). This definition also is used by the medaka community (Taguchi 1990). Although homogeneous lines have been generated in zebrafish through gynogenesis (Johnson et al. 1995; Streisinger et al. 1981), no zebrafish strains have been established that meet the inbred strain definition used by the mice and medaka scientific communities. To our knowledge, the 16 generations of continuous sib-pair mating that characterize the IM strain represent the longest such effort to date. With 4 more generations of careful inbreeding (for a total of 20 generations), the IM strain will become the first inbred strain of zebrafish that meets the definition of inbred strain used for mice and medaka.

Wolf","b'We investigated species divergence, present and past gene flow, levels of nucleotide polymorphism, and linkage disequilibrium in two willows from the plant genus Salix. Salix belongs together with Populus to the Salicaceae family; however, most population genetic studies of Salicaceae have been performed in Populus, the model genus in forest biology. Here we present a study on two closely related willow species Salix viminalis and S. schwerinii, in which we have resequenced 33 and 32 nuclear gene segments representing parts of 18 nuclear loci in 24 individuals for each species. We used coalescent simulations and estimated the split time to around 600,000 years ago and found that there is currently limited gene flow between the species. Mean intronic nucleotide diversity across gene segments was slightly higher in S. schwerinii (\xcf\x80i = 0.00849) than in S. viminalis (\xcf\x80i = 0.00655). Compared with other angiosperm trees, the two willows harbor intermediate levels of silent polymorphisms. The decay of linkage disequilibrium was slower in S. viminalis compared with S. schwerinii, and we speculate that this is due to different demographic histories as S. viminalis has been partly domesticated in Europe.The species concept is fundamental in evolutionary biology, but accurate classification of organisms is still far from trivial. The recent developments of genetic tools that allow identification of genetic differences among organisms have greatly changed our view of how to accurately assess what determines a true species. For instance, based on assessment of genetic diversity among individuals, it has become evident that morphologically similar organisms may form distinct species. And sometimes the opposite holds true, as morphologically dissimilar organisms may in fact have small genetic differences and even be members of the same species. Particularly in plants, species may appear phenotypically diverged while still experiencing high levels of gene flow and little genetic differentiation throughout most of the genome. Species from the genus Salix, or willows, have often been used to illustrate this phenomenon as they have a reputation of being a taxonomic nightmare due to the anticipated high frequency of hybrids. However, the actual frequency of natural hybridization in willows has seldom been investigated thoroughly. As a matter of fact, in one of the early attempts to classify willows, Wichura (1865) found hybrids to be generally rare, although they could be extremely frequent locally, leading Darwin (1865) to express his bewilderment at the \xe2\x80\x9cextreme frequency of hybrid willows.\xe2\x80\x9d In the present study, we aim to investigate the species concept in two closely related willow species using multilocus polymorphism data and to contrast this to what is known about the morphology and general biology of the two species. Species in the Salix genus are trees, shrubs, or subshrubs that, together with the genus Populus (poplars), are members of the Salicaceae family. Populus is recognized as a model genus for genetic and genomic studies in angiosperm trees with many resources available, such as the genome sequence of Populus trichocarpa (Tuskan et al. 2006). There are more than 300 Salix species, and they are widespread in both the Northern and the Southern hemispheres, excluding Australasia and New Guinea. Many species display rapid growth and high biomass yields and are therefore used for short rotation biomass production (Karp et al. 2011). S. viminalis L. and S. schwerinii E. Wolf are dioecious willows that are phenotypically very similar. Both are multistemmed shrubs with long and slender leaves and are commonly found along streams and rivers and in other wet areas. As other Salix species, the sex-ratio is often female biased (Alstr\xc3\xb6m-Rapaport et al. 1997; Ueno et al. 2007). Both species can also easily reproduce clonally, although the extent of clonal reproduction is not well documented in these two species. In S. sachalinensis, for example, clonal propagation was less important than expected (Ueno et al. 2007). S. viminalis has a vast natural distribution ranging from Ireland and United Kingdom in the west to Siberia in the east (Figure 1). The exact boundaries of the natural range in Western Europe are uncertain due to extensive cultivation in the past. In Scandinavia, it was introduced in the 18th century and has since then spread (Larsson and Bremer 1991). This was confirmed with allozyme markers, which also showed differences among rivers in pattern of isolation by distance (IBD), less disturbed rivers showing a greater pattern of IBD than rivers that had experienced a higher level of anthropogenic disturbances (Lascoux et al. 1996). S. schwerinii has a smaller and more eastern natural range (Figure 1), and although the two species in many regions come close to each other, they are apparently rarely found growing together (Skvortsov 1968). There are no reports of hybridization occurring in natural conditions, although they are easy to cross artificially in the laboratory. S. viminalis and S. schwerinii and their hybrids are some of the most commonly used Salix species in the breeding programs for biomass production in Europe. These species have also been the focus of most past investigations of Salix genetics, which include the generation of linkage maps (Berlin et al. 2010; Hanley et al. 2002; Hanley et al. 2007; R\xc3\xb6nnberg-W\xc3\xa4stljung et al. 2003; Tsarouhas et al. 2002) and QTL analyses (R\xc3\xb6nnberg-W\xc3\xa4stljung et al. 2005; Tsarouhas et al. 2003; Tsarouhas et al. 2004; Weih et al. 2006). In contrast to S. viminalis, S. schwerinii has not been used as extensively by humans and grows today in a geographical area in which the impact of the last glaciations was more limited. We would therefore expect the two species to show different patterns of nucleotide diversity and LD (Brubaker et al. 2005). Level and pattern of nucleotide polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium (LD) as well as degree of population differentiation contain information about evolutionary forces that acted in the past and can be used to infer past demographic history. LD is determined by factors such as recombination, mutation, selection, and population admixture, as well as demographic history (Kim et al. 2007; Mueller 2004; Pritchard and Przeworski 2001). A population that has had a stable and large population size for a long time or has experienced a rapid size expansion will have lower levels of LD than small populations whose population size fluctuated through time or experienced recent bottlenecks (Mueller 2004; Pritchard and Przeworski 2001; Reich et al. 2001). The last scenario can be a consequence of domestication. The aim of the present study is to investigate the species divergence between two phenotypically similar willow species, S. viminalis and S. schwerinii, with adjacent but presumably nonoverlapping natural ranges. We look for evidence of past and present gene flow both within species and between species. Considering both is important as gene flow and population dynamics of individual species will influence the amount of gene exchange among species (Petit and Excoffier 2009). We resequenced 33 and 32 nuclear loci that represent parts of 18 nuclear loci in the two species, and we determined levels and patterns of nucleotide diversity, population structure, and extent of linkage disequilibrium. We also used coalescent simulations to reconstruct demographic histories within each species and to estimate the degree of sequence divergence between species. More specifically, we asked whether polymorphisms and patterns of LD differ between the two species according to differences in biology.'","b""We investigated species divergence, present and past gene flow, levels of nucleotide polymorphism, and linkage disequilibrium in two willows from the plant genus Salix.

We resequenced 33 and 32 nuclear loci that represent parts of 18 nuclear loci in the two species, and we determined levels and patterns of nucleotide diversity, population structure, and extent of linkage disequilibrium. We also used coalescent simulations to reconstruct demographic histories within each species and to estimate the degree of sequence divergence between species. More specifically, we asked whether polymorphisms and patterns of LD differ between the two species according to differences in biology. Twenty-four S. viminalis clones were included in the study. They originate from various localities in Europe and were selected to cover the western European part of the species range (Figure 1 and supporting information, Table S1). The clones were collected between 1978 and 1990 and are now growing in a field archive in Pustn\xc3\xa4s, south of Uppsala. For details of the sampling, see Lascoux et al. (1996). Twenty-four S. schwerinii clones were used, of which 17 were F1 crosses produced from different parental clones that are now also growing in the Pustn\xc3\xa4s field archive. The six other clones are growing in a field archive in Sval\xc3\xb6v, southern Sweden, and were kindly provided by Dr. Inger \xc3\x85hman. The parents of the F1 crosses as well as the additional clones originate from Siberia, east of the Lake Baikal, and were collected in 1990 (Figure 1 and Table S1). Young leaves were sampled and stored in \xe2\x88\x9220\xc2\xb0 awaiting DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted with the FastDNA Kit (MP Biomedicals) according to the protocol provided with the kit, and DNA concentrations were determined with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies). We selected 20 protein coding genes from the Populus trichocarpa genome (http://www.phytozome.net/poplar.php) for resequencing in the willows, and for each gene, we attempted to resequence two segments (A and B) of approximately 500\xe2\x80\x931200 bp with various distances between them (Table 1). This method is known as the locus pair approach and has previously been used to study genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium in humans (Frisse et al. 2001; Voight et al. 2005). This sampling scheme was used, as it will allow estimation of local as well as more long-range linkage disequilibrium without requiring extensive resequencing efforts. The poplar genome sequence served as template for the construction of PCR primers, and Primer3Plus was used for the primer design (Untergasser et al. 2007). The primers were positioned in exonic regions. Primer sequences that resulted in successful amplification and the positions of these primers in the poplar genome are provided in Table S2. The PCRs contained 10 ng genomic DNA, 1\xc3\x97 PCR buffer II (Applied Biosystems), 2.5 mM MgCl2 (Applied Biosystems), 0.2 mM dNTP mix (Fermentas), 0.5 \xc2\xb5M of each primer (Invitrogen), and 0.5 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) in a total of 15 \xce\xbcl. The reactions were run on a MyCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with a PCR profile consisting of 10 min denaturation at 95\xc2\xb0 followed by 35 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95\xc2\xb0, 30 s annealing at 55\xc2\xb0, and 1 min extension at 72\xc2\xb0 with a final 10 min 72\xc2\xb0 step. Amplification success was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products were cleaned with 1 \xce\xbcl of a mixture of Exonuclease I (New England BioLabs) and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP) (Fermentas) for every 5 \xce\xbcl of PCR product before they were directly sequenced at Macrogen, Inc., Europe (Macrogen, Amsterdam, Netherlands) using the forward and reverse PCR primers as sequencing primers. Sequences were edited, and contigs were assembled separately for each segment and sample using Seqman version 8.1.4 (Lasergene, DNASTAR), and heterozygous sites were scored with ambiguity codes. All sequences were carefully checked by eye. Two sequences were created for each sample in DAMBE version 5.2.5. (Xia and Xie 2001). As the poplar genome harbors many paralogs, BLAST searches against the genome database on the NCBI web site were performed with each of the gene segment to confirm that the orthologs had been amplified. All sequences are available in the NCBI Genbank sequence database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) under accession numbers HQ625673\xe2\x80\x93HQ628624. Cloning of three segments I-53B, II-33B, and II-36A was performed using pGEM-T Easy Vector System I following the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s protocols (Promega). PCR products of one to three S. schwerinii samples were cloned per gene segment. The PCRs were performed with 10 ng genomic DNA, 1\xc3\x97 PCR buffer HF (Finnzyme), 0.2 mM dNTP mix (Fermentas), 0.3 \xc2\xb5M of each primer (Invitrogen), and 0.2 U Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzyme) in a total of 20 \xce\xbcl mixed and run on a MyCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with a PCR profile consisting of 30 s at 98\xc2\xb0 followed by 30 cycles of 10 s at 98\xc2\xb0, 30 s at 57\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xb0 and 2 min at 72\xc2\xb0 with a final step of 10 min at 72\xc2\xb0. An A-nucleotide was added to the blunt-end PCR products prior to ligation according to the protocol found at (http://www.promega.com/pnotes/62/7807_15/7807_15_core.pdf). Ten colonies per sample were grown in overnight cultures, and plasmids were extracted using GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Fermentas). Insert lengths were tested with PCR before sequencing with T7 and SP6 primers at Macrogen Inc. Cloned and directly sequenced DNA sequences were compared, and reconstructed haplotypes were compared with the cloned alleles. Sequence alignments were constructed for each segment and species using Clustal W (Thompson et al. 1994) in the Alignment Explorer tool of MEGA4 using default parameters (Tamura et al. 2007). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested for each SNP using Arlequin version 3.5.1.2 (Excoffier et al. 2005) for each species, and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were tested with exact tests using default settings. Calculations of standard population genetics parameters were carried out for each segment with the DnaSP software version 5.10 (Librado and Rozas 2009). The level of polymorphism for each segment was estimated both as haplotype and nucleotide diversities; exons and introns were analyzed separately. Indels were excluded from all analyses. The pairwise nucleotide diversity (\xcf\x80) (Nei 1987) and Watterson\xe2\x80\x99s estimator (\xce\xb8) (Watterson 1975) were obtained for intronic DNA (\xcf\x80i, \xce\xb8i) and for synonymous (\xcf\x80s, \xce\xb8s) and nonsynonymous sites (\xcf\x80a, \xce\xb8a) separately. \xcf\x80 and \xce\xb8 are expected to be almost the same for neutral sites at statistical equilibrium under mutation and genetic drift (Tajima 1989). Analyses of allele frequency spectra (Tajima's D) were done for each segment. The genetic structure within each species was tested using Structure version 2.3.3 (Pritchard et al. 2000). Sites that showed significant statistical association due to LD after Bonferroni correction (\xce\xb1 = 0.05) were removed before the Structure analysis. To infer the structure of the sampled populations, the admixture model was used with a burn-in of 50,000 and a run length of 500,000 for a number of clusters from K = 1 to K = 7, allowing for correlation of allele frequencies between clusters. Ten independent runs per K were performed to ensure that the results were consistent. The most likely number of clusters was estimated with the original method from Pritchard et al. (2000) and with the \xce\x94K statistics given in Evanno et al. (2005). The level of divergence between the species was investigated using Structure version 2.3.3 with similar criteria as above. The degree of genetic divergence between the two species, FST, was assessed by a locus-by-locus analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) in Arlequin version 3.5.1.2 (Excoffier et al. 2005). Significance was determined with 10,000 permutations. We also assessed the number of shared vs. fixed sites in DnaSP version 5.10 (Librado and Rozas 2009). The diploid sequences were phased into haplotypes using PHASE version 2.1 with default parameters (Stephens and Donnelly 2003; Stephens et al. 2001). This was done for each segment independently. However, in V-20, VI-4, and VII-11, the A and B segments were located next to each other and primer pairs were overlapping; therefore, they were treated as single segments. The PHASE analysis in S. viminalis resulted in 97% of reconstructed haplotype pairs with > 90% posterior probability and 88% of reconstructed haplotype pairs with > 90% posterior probability in S. schwerinii. The levels of linkage disequilibrium between SNPs with frequencies > 0.05 in reconstructed haplotypes with posterior probabilities \xe2\x89\xa5 0.90 was estimated as r2, the mean squared correlation in allelic state (Hill and Robertson 1968), using DnaSP version 5.10 (Librado and Rozas 2009). Significance of the associations between SNPs was determined with Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s exact test with Bonferroni correction. The overall decay of LD was estimated by plotting r2 against the physical distance between SNPs. We then fitted a nonlinear regression that yields a least-squares estimate of the average recombination parameter for all segments, \xcf\x81, given the empirical relationship between pairwise r2 and physical distance between sites (Hill and Weir 1988). To investigate the decay of LD over longer physical distances, we combined the A and B segments for each gene and again reconstructed haplotypes in PHASE. The results of the A and B segments combined were 93% haplotype pairs with 90% posterior probability in S. viminalis and 83% in S. schwerinii. LD was estimated as previously described, and a new dataset with r2 was created for each species. These datasets contain r2 from the combined A and B segments for each gene for which we estimated the complete segment lengths in willow (see below), as well as data based on the A and B segment separately in cases where we did not know the complete lengths or where only the A or B segment was sequenced for a specific gene. The first and the second dataset are not independent datasets, and in some instances, they contain the same data. With knowledge of the physical distance between the A and B segments in willow, we can study the decay of LD over larger physical distance. In Populus trichocarpa, the lengths varied among the genes and ranged from 1466 to 6073 base pairs (Table 1). To estimate the corresponding lengths in the willows, we used the forward primer in the first segment and reverse primer in the second segment in PCR. The lengths of the PCR products were determined by comparisons to a DNA size marker (MassRuler DNA ladder mix, Fermentas) on agarose gels. DNA from two S schwerinii and two S. viminalis clones were used and Phusion DNA polymerase was done according to the protocol previously described. The demographic history of each species and the time of the split between them were estimated using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) as described in Blum and Francois (2010). First, a set of summary statistics was calculated for our dataset after individuals and sites with too many missing data were removed. Only the longest intron sequence for each investigated gene was used, resulting in 14 loci from 14 genes included in the analyses. For each species separately, we tested three demographic models: a standard neutral model, a population growth model, and a bottleneck model. For each demographic model, prior distributions of the model parameters were constructed, and 106 draws from these prior distributions were used to simulate coalescent genealogies using the coalescent simulator ms (Hudson 2002). The prior distributions were chosen as U(min, max) or log-U(min, max), with min and max set at reasonable values following initial trials with different values of min and max. For each draw, 14 independent genealogies were simulated, with the number of sequences and base pairs per sequence corresponding to the 14 used loci. Summary statistics were calculated using libsequence (Thornton 2003). For summary statistics, we used the mean and variance of Watterson\xe2\x80\x99s \xce\xb8, Tajima\xe2\x80\x99s D, and the number of haplotypes. Next, the Euclidean distance (\xce\xb4) between the simulated summary statistics and the observed summary statistics was computed and a proportion (P\xce\xb4) of simulation outcomes with the smallest distance was retained. The value of P\xce\xb4 was set to 0.001. Initial studies indicated that the outcome of the analysis was rather consistent over a wide range of P\xce\xb4 values (0.001\xe2\x80\x930.1)), but the peaks in posterior estimates were sharpest at the lowest threshold of P\xce\xb4. Finally, the posterior distributions of parameters and the posterior model probabilities were estimated with the nonlinear regression approach [feed-forward neural network (FFNN) regression models] developed by Blum and Francois (2010) and implemented in the R package abc. This approach helps to overcome two problems inherent to the ABC approach, namely, the curse of dimensionality and model comparison (Blum and Francois 2010). The neutral model simply consists of two parameters; the population mutation rate (\xce\xb8 = 4N0\xce\xbc) and the population recombination rate (\xcf\x81 = 4N0r). The prior distributions of both parameters are log uniform distribution with min of 0.0001 and max of 1. The same priors for \xce\xb8 and \xcf\x81 were used for the two other demographic models. The growth model has an additional parameter, the growth rate \xce\xb1. Its prior follows a log uniform distribution with min of 0.001 and max of 10. The bottleneck model assumes a constant population size N0 until tb units of time backward in time when population size instantaneously drops to Nb for d units of time after which the population size instantaneously increases to N0. All units of time are in 4N0 generations. The prior distributions of tb were uniform U(0, 10), and those of d were uniform U(0, 10). The bottleneck severity (f = Nb/N0) was fixed at 0.02. For the combined dataset of both species, we considered three models. First we tested a neutral population split model with migration, with parameters N1 (size of population 1), N2 (size of population 2), ts (time since populations diverged), M = 4N0m (symmetric migration rate between population 1 and population 2), and Nanc (size of ancient population). The second model used was a population split model without migration defined as above but with M fixed at 0. Finally, we considered a model in which the two species did not split but interbred freely. To make this model as close as possible to the population split models, we also assumed a population size change to Nanc at time of ts. The priors were initially set at a relatively large interval and run for 106 iterations. Thereafter, the parameters were estimated, and new priors were constructed near the 99% credible interval of the estimated parameters. As summary statistics in the species divergence scenarios, we used the averages of Watterson\xe2\x80\x99s \xce\xb8, Tajima\xe2\x80\x99s D, and the number of haplotypes in each population and in the combined data, as well as Wright\xe2\x80\x99s FST and the numbers of shared, fixed, and private polymorphisms. To evaluate the fit of the models to the data, for each model, 104 draws of the parameters were made from the estimated posterior distributions, and coalescent simulations were performed using those parameters. The simulations were summarized by the mean and variance of several summary statistics (see Table S3 and Table S4), and then compared with the observed data. For each summary statistic, the probability of observing a value lower than the observed value given the model was estimated. To identify outlier loci, this was also done for each segment separately. The overall fit of the data to the model and comparisons among models can be visualized using principal component analysis (PCA). The multilocus average and variance of summary statistics were used to compute the first two principal components (PC) of the data for each model. The summary statistics used were the same as provided in Table S3. The 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) of the two first components were plotted together with the predicted values of the data using the PCA as predictor. We designed 40 primer pairs to amplify two regions of 20 nuclear genes. Sequences of sufficient quality were obtained for at least one segment from 18 loci (Table 1). Sequences for I-53A, VIII-22A, XII-18A, and XII-18B were not of sufficient quality, and they were therefore not used in any analysis. The same applied to IV-18B and VII-1B in S. schwerinii. As a result, 32 loci were analyzed for sequence variation in S. schwerinii and 33 loci in S. viminalis, representing 18 genes located on 10 different linkage groups. A total of 2193 base pairs of cloned and directly sequenced PCR products were compared, and 15 SNPs were confirmed. In all cases, the DNA sequences of the cloned segments were identical to the DNA sequences obtained with direct sequencing. We confirmed that a reconstructed haplotype with posterior probability 1.0 was indeed correct. However, we also found that when the most probable haplotype pair has a probability between 0.3 and 0.7, the phase is likely to be incorrect. Eleven percent of all SNPs deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg expectations (P \xe2\x89\xa4 0.01), and in all cases, this was due to a deficit of heterozygote genotypes. The majority of the significant SNPs were located in three gene segments: II-36B, IV-18A, and VIII-5B (Table 2). Thirteen percent of all SNPs deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg expectations (P \xe2\x89\xa4 0.01), and again this was due to a deficit of heterozygote genotypes. The majority of the significant SNPs were located in three gene segments: II-36B, IV-18B, and VIII-5A (Table 3). To conclude, the majority of the SNPs in both species that deviated from deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg expectations were located in three genes: II-36, IV-18, and VIII-5. For 12 genes, the PCRs resulted in specific PCR products similar to the expected lengths in poplar (Table 1) and could be used in the analysis of LD between segments in genes. For each species, we have two datasets for which we estimated linkage disequilibrium (r2). In the first dataset, r2 is estimated between SNPs located within segments, and in the second, r2 is estimated between segments and within segments. Within the segments, average r2 = 0.34, and among 1610 pairwise comparisons between SNPs, 436 were significant (P < 0.05) after Bonferroni correction (27%). LD decayed within the segments with r2 dropping below 0.2 around 1000 base pairs (Figure 2A). The combined dataset allowed us to analyze the decay of LD between SNPs with a maximum distance of 4000 base pairs. The average r2 = 0.31 and 350 out of 1862 pairwise comparisons (19%) were significant (P < 0.05) after Bonferroni correction. As in the above case, r2 dropped below 0.2 around 1000 base pairs (Figure 2B). Patterns of linkage disequilibrium described as squared correlations between segregating sites: (A) S. schwerinii within gene segments, (B) S. schwerinii between gene segments, (C) S. viminalis within gene segments, and (D) S. viminalis between gene segments. We found more LD in S. viminalis than in S. schwerinii. Within the gene segments, average r2 = 0.49, and among 1780 pairwise comparisons between SNPs, 591 were significant after Bonferroni correction (33%). LD did not decay between SNPs with maximum distance of 1300 base pairs (Figure 2C). As in S. schwerinii, with the combined dataset we could study LD between SNPs with up to 4000 base pairs distance, and we found that LD dropped below 0.2 after around 4000 base pairs (Figure 2D). The average r2 = 0.40 and 484 out of 2476 pairwise comparisons (20%) were significant after Bonferroni correction. Intronic nucleotide variation was estimated in an average of 42 haplotypes, and a total of 11,264 base pairs from 28 loci were aligned (Table 2). We identified a total of 358 SNPs in the introns of which 49 were singletons. This corresponds to 1 SNP every 31 base pairs. Synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide variation was estimated in an average of 44 haplotypes and a total of 2188 base pairs from four loci (Table 4). We found a total of 28 synonymous SNPs of which 5 were singletons (1 SNP every 18 base pairs) and 22 nonsynonymous SNPs of which 3 were singletons (1 SNP every 77 base pairs). Five SNPs had 3 variants of which 3 were located in II-36A and one in III-24A and III-24B. Pairwise nucleotide diversity (\xcf\x80i) in introns was between 0.0014 and 0.0237 (average \xcf\x80i = 0.0085), and \xce\xb8i ranged between 0.0008 and 0.0173 (average \xce\xb8i = 0.0070). The synonymous pairwise nucleotide diversity (\xcf\x80s) was between 0.0036 and 0.0175 (average \xcf\x80s = 0.0095), and \xce\xb8s ranged between 0.0057 and 0.0173 (average \xce\xb8s = 0.0100). The nonsynonymous pairwise nucleotide diversity (\xcf\x80a) ranged between 0.0021 and 0.0041 (average \xcf\x80a = 0.0030), and \xce\xb8a was between 0.0018 and 0.0031 (average \xce\xb8a = 0.0025). The ratio between \xcf\x80a:\xcf\x80s = 0.278, and synonymous diversity was on average 26% greater than intronic nucleotide diversity. The mean Tajima\xe2\x80\x99s D across loci was positive (0.59), but only two loci (III-24B and X-27A) showed significant positive Tajima\xe2\x80\x99s D-values (Table 2). Intronic nucleotide variation was analyzed in an average of 42 haplotypes, and a total of 13,058 base pairs from 30 loci were aligned (Table 3). We identified a total of 373 SNPs in the introns of which 57 were singletons. This corresponds to 1 SNP every 35 base pairs. Synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide variation was estimated in an average of 47 haplotypes and a total of 2,475 base pairs from four loci (Table 5). We found a total of 10 synonymous SNPs of which 1 was a singleton (1 SNP every 56 base pairs) and 10 nonsynonymous SNPs of which none was a singleton (1 SNP every 191 base pairs). Two SNPs had 3 variants of which 1 was located in V-18B and 1 in V-20B. One SNP with 4 variants was found in VII-1A. Pairwise nucleotide diversity (\xcf\x80i) in introns was between 0.0009 and 0.0198 (average \xcf\x80i = 0.0066), and \xce\xb8i ranged between 0.0010 and 0.0121 (average \xce\xb8i = 0.0058). The synonymous pairwise nucleotide diversity (\xcf\x80s) was between 0 and 0.0217 (average \xcf\x80s = 0.0067), and \xce\xb8s ranged between 0 and 0.0133 (average \xce\xb8s = 0.0048). The nonsynonymous pairwise nucleotide diversity (\xcf\x80a) ranged between 0.0001 and 0.0039 (average \xcf\x80a = 0.0014), and \xce\xb8a was between 0.00004 and 0.0038 (average \xce\xb8a = 0.0013). The ratio between \xcf\x80a:\xcf\x80s = 0.238, and synonymous diversity was on average 7% greater than intronic nucleotide diversity (Table 5). As in S. schwerinii, the mean Tajima\xe2\x80\x99s D across loci was positive (0.24), but only one segment (IV-18B) showed a significant positive Tajima\xe2\x80\x99s D-value (Table 3). Based on 160 SNPs exhibiting no significant LD (P < 0.05, average r2 = 0.024) from 24 S. schwerinii individuals, the most likely number of clusters was K = 3 both when the original method from Pritchard et al. (2000) was used and with the \xce\x94K statistics given in Evanno et al. (2005) (data not shown). However, it is doubtful that there is any population structure in S. schwerinii because the difference in LnPD with K = 1, K = 2, and K = 3 is very small (average LnPD = \xe2\x88\x922450, \xe2\x88\x922459, and \xe2\x88\x922446, respectively). Further support is the clustering results for K = 3 (Figure S1A), which show no signs of structure for K = 3. Based on 80 SNPs exhibiting no significant LD (P < 0.05, average r2 = 0.032) from 24 S. viminalis individuals, the most likely number of clusters using both methods was K = 2 with 6 and 18 individuals in the two groups (Figure S1B). Again, we believe that this structure has limited biological meaning as the differences in LnPD for the different K were rather small (average LnPD for K = 1\xe2\x80\x937 were \xe2\x88\x921299, \xe2\x88\x921200, \xe2\x88\x921207, \xe2\x88\x921273, \xe2\x88\x921286, \xe2\x88\x921301, and \xe2\x88\x921313, respectively). When analyzing both species using Structure, using 52 SNPs exhibiting no significant LD (P < 0.05, average r2 = 0.047), both methods clearly supported K = 2 clusters, clearly separating the two species (Figure S1C and Figure S2). The locus-by-locus AMOVA analysis gave FST = 0.56 (P < 0.0001). The total number of fixed differences was only 5, while the total number of shared polymorphisms was 71 (Table 6). The observed data could best be explained by the standard neutral model in both species (P = 0.41 for S. viminalis, P = 0.47 for S. schwerinii), although the difference in probability between models was small, meaning that the alternative models could not be ruled out (Table 7). However, in the case of the growth model, the growth rate was very small (\xce\xb",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mode = 0.0038 for S. viminalis, \xce\xb1mode = 0.0025 for S. schwerinii), and in the bottleneck model, a very ancient bottleneck was inferred (tbmode = 5.29 Ne generations for S.viminalis, tbmode = 8.07 Ne generations for S. schwerinii). Hence, in both cases, the posterior distributions of parameters suggest that a standard neutral model describes well the recent history of these two species. In this model, the population mutation rate \xce\xb8 was estimated to be 0.0026 (0.0014\xe2\x80\x930.0034) in S. viminalis and 0.0033 (0.0025\xe2\x80\x930.0044) in S. schwerinii, and the population recombination rate \xcf\x81 was estimated to be 0.0036 (0.0007\xe2\x80\x930.0085) in S. viminalis and 0.0074 (0.0012\xe2\x80\x930.033) in S. schwerinii. The observed data could best be explained using the population split model with or without migration and a rather recent split (Psplit_with_migration = 0.66, Psplit_no_migration = 0.31, Pno_split = 0). The time since the population split event occurred was estimated to be 0.43 (0.16\xe2\x80\x931.98) \xc3\x97 4Ne generations with migration and 0.32 (0.19\xe2\x80\x930.47) \xc3\x97 4Ne generations without migration. Translating this to absolute time needs estimates of the effective population size, Ne, and the mutation rate. Tuskan et al. (2006) estimated the synonymous substitution rate in the closely related genus Populus to be roughly 6-fold lower than in Arabidopsis to be compatible with fossil data. Using the Ossowski et al. (2010) estimate of \xce\xbc = 5.9 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x929/year in Arabidopsis, this would translate to \xce\xbc = 9.8 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9210/year in Salix, which is lower but of the same order of magnitude as the estimated mutation rate in Salicaceae in Berlin et al. (2010) (1.28 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x929 to 1.68 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x929). Assuming an approximate neutral mutation rate \xce\xbc = 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x929/year, a generation time g of 10 years, and the posterior estimate of \xce\xb8 = 0.0016, Ne would be \xce\xb8/4\xce\xbcg = 40,000. Assuming this Ne, the posterior estimate of split time in years would be 700,000 (260,000\xe2\x80\x933,100,000) with migration and 510,000 (300,000\xe2\x80\x93752,000) without migration (Figure 3). Note that as we assume a mutation rate per year, the estimated split time in years will not depend on assumptions about generation time. While the relative size of the S. viminalis to the S. schwerinii population was close to 1 [0.80 (0.59\xe2\x80\x931.19)] with migration and 0.63 (0.36\xe2\x80\x931.04) without migration, the relative size of the ancient population to the current S. viminalis population size was estimated to be larger: 3.99 (0.59\xe2\x80\x9311.26) with migration and 3.01 (1.44\xe2\x80\x936.06) without migration. The migration rate M was estimated to be 0.036 (0.002\xe2\x80\x930.11). \xce\xb8 was estimated to be 0.0016 (0.0008\xe2\x80\x930.0026) with migration and 0.0022 (0.0012\xe2\x80\x930.0037) without migration in line with the per species estimates. Also the \xcf\x81 estimates were in line with the per species estimates: 0.017 (0.0089\xe2\x80\x930.028) with migration and 0.017 (0.0091\xe2\x80\x930.026) without migration. The model without a population split gave wide posterior estimates (Table 8). Posterior and prior distributions of population split time. Solid line: population split and migration; dashed line: population split without migration; dotted line: prior distribution. On the X-axis time in years since split event occurred assuming Ne = 33 000 and a generation time of 2 years. To assess the fit of data to ABC models, the data were summarized by the average and variance of several summary statistics, and then compared with the distributions of summary statistics obtained from coalescent simulations based on parameters drawn randomly from their posterior distributions. The differences between models in the analysis per species were low, hence, the fits of the models to the data were almost equal (Table S3, Table S4, Figure 4). Multilocus averages of neutrality test statistics (Tajima\xe2\x80\x99s D, Fu and Li F* and D*) were higher in the data than expected under each model, although significantly different at \xce\xb1 = 0.05 only for Tajima\xe2\x80\x99s D and Fu and Li F* in S. schwerinii. The variance of Tajima\xe2\x80\x99s D was also high in all models, but it was significantly higher than expected only in S. viminalis bottleneck and growth models. In the population split models, the difference between models was much more pronounced (Figure 5), at least when split and no split models were compared. In the population split model with migration, the same outlier loci were detected as in the per species models (Table S5 and Table S6). For the multilocus statistics, only the variance in number of haplotypes was significantly higher in the data (P = 0.98) in the population split with migration model, and no statistic at all in the population split without migration (Table S7). In the model without population split, the average and variance of FST and number of fixed polymorphisms were significantly higher in the data compared with the model (P = 1) (Table S7).

At present, both S. viminalis and S. schwerinii have widespread natural ranges with a possible contact zone in Eastern Russia. Even though the two species come close together in many regions, it seems that they are rarely growing together (Skvortsov 1968). Morphologically, S. viminalis is not entirely homogenous over its vast range; however, the observed differences are not considered enough to classify them as different taxonomic units (Skvortsov 1968), and overall, the two species are very similar in their vegetative appearance. Further support for the close relationship between S. viminalis and S. schwerinii is that they can easily be crossed in the laboratory. Initially, we were interested to know how genetically diverged the species are. Our resequencing effort shows that there are a large number of shared polymorphisms and very few fixed differences between the species. Such pattern could be the result either of secondary contact and recent gene flow or of incomplete lineage sorting since the split of the species. Our data support the last scenario because in species with large effective population sizes, a long time is required for alleles to go to fixation, even in the absence of gene flow (Hudson and Coyne 2002). Furthermore, our analyses show that most shared polymorphisms are ancestral or at least do not reflect recent gene flow, and the average split time was estimated to be on average 600,000 years ago. It is, however, difficult to detect gene flow occurring shortly after the two species separated (Becquet and Przeworski 2009), so we cannot rule out that some gene flow has occurred since the split. Further support of two clearly separated species come from a Structure analysis (Pritchard et al. 2000) with both species, where the most likely number of clusters was K = 2 and the two species clearly separated (Figure S1), as well as the high FST value (0.56) estimated between them. To summarize the results so far, we have found that the two species diverged from a common ancestor rather recently and only restricted gene flow has occurred since then. Our data thus support limited hybridization between these species in nature. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that hybridization occurs in or near the contact zone as our samples do not originate from the area where the two species come in close contact. This is, for example, the case with S. alba L. and S. fragilis L. in central Europe that frequently hybridize in the contact zone to form S. \xc3\x97 rubens Schrank (Kehl et al. 2008; Triest et al. 2009). However, outside the contact zone, hybridization does not seem to be substantial. We acknowledge that our sampling does not allow us to firmly conclude whether these two species are truly distinct or constitute a geographic gradient of one species. Field observations (Skvortsov 1968) support the view that they are truly distinct species, possibly adapted to different ecological niches because they are rarely found growing together. However, further genetic studies, including more extensive sampling throughout the natural range of each species, including the contact zone, are needed to settle this issue. Mean intronic nucleotide diversity across gene segments was slightly higher in S. schwerinii (\xcf\x80i = 0.00849) than in S. viminalis (\xcf\x80i = 0.00655). These values are intermediate when compared with other angiosperm trees that demonstrate a great variation in synonymous and silent nucleotide diversities. Extreme values ranging from 0.012 to 0.016 have been observed in Populus tremula (Ingvarsson 2005; Ingvarsson 2008), and considerably lower values in P. balsamifera (0.0030\xe2\x80\x930.0045) (Keller et al. 2010; Olson et al. 2010), P. tricocharpa (0.0029\xe2\x80\x930.0035) (Gilchrist et al. 2006; Tuskan et al. 2006), P. nigra (0.0021), and P. alba (0.0035) (Giusi Zaina, personal communication, based on 31 fragments of P. nigra, 18 fragments of P. alba, and 12 genotypes in each species). Different effective population sizes have been put forward as an explanation for the difference in \xcf\x80s between P. tremula and P. balsamifera (Keller et al. 2010; Olson et al. 2010). This is supported by the difference in the ratio between \xcf\x80a and \xcf\x80s and the finding that nonsynonymous diversity is similar in the two species but the synonymous is much higher in P. tremula (Olson et al. 2010). Due to a smaller effective population size in P. balsamifera, purifying selection will be less efficient and deleterious nonsynonymous mutations will therefore accumulate, something that can be seen in the higher \xcf\x80a:\xcf\x80s ratio in P. balsamifera (0.267) compared with P. tremula (0.142) (Olson et al. 2010). In S. viminalis and S. schwerinii, \xcf\x80a:\xcf\x80s = 0.238 and 0.278 and are thus very similar to the values reported in P. balsamifera, suggesting that P. tremula could be an outlier in this respect. Because our data were limited, this would need to be confirmed with a larger dataset. There were not many differences in nucleotide diversity between the species; however, linkage disequilibrium is more sensitive to capture recent departures from the standard neutral model, and indeed, there were greater differences in LD among the two Salix species compared with the differences in nucleotide diversities. LD was higher in S. viminalis (r2 = 0.40\xe2\x80\x930.49) than in S. schwerinii (r2 = 0.31\xe2\x80\x930.34), and LD decayed to 0.2 around 4000 base pairs in S. viminalis and around 1000 base pairs in S. schwerinii. The absolute values of these LD estimates should be treated with caution, however, as they are possibly inflated due to the way the haplotypic phase was determined, but as both species were affected in the same way, the comparison of relative values should remain valid. Difficulties in inferring the haplotype phase happened when one segment contained multiple heterozygotes, which were then excluded from further analysis. Similar to the situation for nucleotide diversities, there are great differences in LD among outcrossing angiosperm trees. In P. tremula, LD decayed rapidly to <0.05 in around a few hundred bases (Ingvarsson 2005); however, in P. balsamifera, values are more similar to those observed in S. viminalis (mean r2 = 0.52), and LD did not decay in the gene fragments (Olson et al. 2010). These data are comparable as the phases were determined in a similar fashion. Many factors, such as recombination, mutation, selection, population admixture, and demographic history, affect LD, which could explain why LD differs so much between species. We can only speculate about the cause of the difference in LD between S. viminalis and S. schwerinii. Because population structure may affect estimates of LD, we checked whether any of the species showed evidence for population subdivision. Each species was analyzed using Structure version 2.3.3 (Pritchard et al. 2000). The analyses revealed low levels of population subdivision in both species, which could certainly be a consequence of the limited sampling. However, it is also possible that these species do not demonstrate great population structures throughout their whole species ranges due to the high dispersal possibilities, as both seeds and pollen are partly wind dispersed. Even though the Salix genus is generally considered to be insect pollinated, several species are also known to be wind pollinated, as the flowers are morphologically intermediate between wind and insect pollination (Peeters and Totland 1999). So a possible cause for the difference in LD between the two species is different demographic histories. In contrast to S. schwerinii, S. viminalis has been used for basket making by humans for centuries, and in the eighteenth century, it was extensively used as a crop with several thousands of hectares of cultivated areas in, for example, France and Poland (refs. in Lascoux et al. 1996). It is thus possible that the longer LD in S. viminalis is an effect of bottlenecks at domestication events. To test this further, we performed coalescent simulations to find out whether any of the species deviated from the standard neutral model (SNM) using bottleneck and population growth models. Bottlenecks caused by founder or domestication events and population expansions triggered by advances and retreats of glaciers have resulted in deviations from the SNM in many natural plant populations (Siol et al. 2010). Although the majority of plant populations deviate from the SNM, our analyses show that neither Salix species do. This was particularly unexpected in S. viminalis. A likely explanation is that because demographic changes in S. viminalis occurred recently, they are not reflected in the site frequency spectrum or, at least, they were not captured by a dataset of the size used in the present study. This lack of deviation of the SNM in Salix is most likely again an effect of the large Ne and long-distance dispersal. This is the first study to present data of species divergence and levels of nucleotide polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium in species from the genus Salix. The results suggest that S. viminalis and S. schwerinii split on average 600,000 years ago and that limited species-wide gene flow has occurred since the split. Both species harbor substantial amounts of genetic variation, which is likely due to large effective population sizes. The large effective population sizes are also possibly the reason why there are many shared polymorphisms and few fixed differences, despite the limited gene flow. Compared with other angiosperm tree species, the rate of decay of LD in both species is fairly slow, particularly in S.viminalis. The difference between the two Salix species is possibly due to different demographic histories: S. viminalis has been partly domesticated in Europe, whereas S. schwerinii has not. The rate of decay of LD has implications for the potential utility of association mapping as it effectively determines whether genome-wide scans are feasible or whether a candidate gene approach has to be used. The slow LD decay in these species suggests that haplotype structure may be strong and functional sites may be linked to nearby sites that have no influence on function.

Naturally occurring cases of sex-linked distorters have been reported in a variety of organisms, including several species of Drosophila; they trigger genetic conflict over the sex ratio, which is an important evolutionary force. However, with a few exceptions, the causal loci are unknown. Here, we molecularly characterize the segmental duplication involved in the Paris sex-ratio system that is still evolving in natural populations of Drosophila simulans. This 37.5 kb tandem duplication spans six genes, from the second intron of the Trf2 gene (TATA box binding protein-related factor 2) to the first intron of the org-1 gene (optomotor-blind-related-gene-1). Sequence analysis showed that the duplication arose through the production of an exact copy on the template chromosome itself. We estimated this event to be less than 500 years old. We also detected specific signatures of the duplication mechanism; these support the Duplication-Dependent Strand Annealing model. The region at the junction between the two duplicated segments contains several copies of an active transposable element, Hosim1, alternating with 687 bp repeats that are noncoding but transcribed. The almost-complete sequence identity between copies made it impossible to complete the sequencing and assembly of this region. These results form the basis for the functional dissection of Paris sex-ratio drive and will be valuable for future studies designed to better understand the dynamics and the evolutionary significance of sex chromosome drive.Meiotic drive is a phenomenon by which one member of a pair of alleles or chromosomes of a heterozygous individual is preferentially transmitted to the next generation\xe2\x80\x94a phenomenon that is in violation of Mendel\xe2\x80\x99s first law (Sandler and Novitski 1957). Many examples of meiotic drive have been reported in fungi, plants, insects, worms, and mammals (Atlan et al. 1997; Lyttle 1991); sex-ratio drive specifically refers to meiotic drive in which the cheater allele is sex linked and is expressed only in heterogametic individuals, resulting in a skewed offspring sex ratio. X chromosome drive was first observed in males of Drosophila obscura (Gershenson 1928) and has since been documented in a number of dipteran species, mainly within the Drosophila genus (Jaenike 2001). In Drosophila, the sex-ratio phenotype is usually associated with X chromosome rearrangements. Inversions of varying complexity, which presumably keep the elements contributing to the drive together, impede genetic dissection in most of the species (De Carvalho and Klaczko 1992; Dyer et al. 2007; Hauschteck-Jungen 1990; Prakash 1974; Stalker 1961; Voelker 1972). High-resolution genetic mapping has revealed gene/segmental duplication in two inversion-free sex-ratio drive systems in D. simulans: Paris (Montchamp-Moreau et al. 2006) and Winters (Tao et al. 2007a). Mendelian alleles are favored by natural selection if they increase the fitness of their carriers. However, sex-ratio and other alleles responsible for meiotic drive are selfish genetic elements that can spread in populations as long as their preferential transmission is not offset by strong deleterious effects. The spread of a sex-linked distorter allele causes skewed population sex ratios and triggers an evolutionary arms race at the genome scale. Selective forces favor the evolution of unlinked drive suppressors to equalize the sex ratio (i.e., on the Y chromosome or the autosomes) but also favor alleles that are closely linked to the primary drive locus if they enhance distortion (Fisher 1930; Hamilton 1967). Recurrent genetic conflict over the transmission of sex chromosomes is thought to have profound evolutionary consequences, including epigenetic regulation of sex chromosomes during meiosis, genomic distribution of genes expressed in the germline, change in sex determination, and the evolution of hybrid sterility [discussed in Meiklejohn and Tao (2010) and Werren and Beukeboom (1998)]. The last hypothesis has received empirical support from studies in Drosophila (Phadnis and Orr 2009; Presgraves 2010; Tao et al. 2001). However, information about the underlying molecular mechanisms, necessary to assess the evolutionary significance of sex chromosome drive, is still critically lacking. So far, both distorter and suppressor genes together have been identified only in the Winters sex-ratio system of D. simulans, and the individual function of these genes is still elusive (Tao et al. 2007a; Tao et al. 2007b). Here, we molecularly dissected the chromosomal region responsible for Paris sex-ratio drive\xe2\x80\x94a textbook case in D. simulans (Jaenike 2008; Mercot et al. 1995). This system is particularly interesting in two ways. First, the etiology of drive is associated with a meiosis phenotype: the loss of Y-bearing sperm results from a disjunction failure of the Y chromosome sister chromatids during the second meiotic division (Cazemajor et al. 2000). Second, the emergence of Paris sex-ratio X chromosomes and the spread of these chromosomes in natural populations have triggered the evolution of autosomal and Y-linked suppressors (Atlan et al. 1997; Jutier et al. 2004). These features of the Paris system provide an opportunity to study the evolutionary impact of the emergence of sex-ratio drive and to identify a network of genes controlling segregation of the sex chromosomes. In the Paris system, two distinct distorter elements have been fine-mapped to the cytological bands 7E-F of the sex-ratio reference chromosome XSR6: a segmental duplication and a second element located 100\xe2\x80\x93150 kb away (Montchamp-Moreau et al. 2006). We used males carrying XSR6 to produce a library of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC). We obtained, assembled, and analyzed a sequence of about 300 kb that contains the two distorter elements. This process allowed us to identify the limits of the segmental duplication and associated repetitive elements. We were also able to shed light on the mechanism and age of the duplication event, as well as the coding potential of the different components of the duplication.'","b""Sex-ratio distorters are X-linked selfish genetic elements that facilitate their own transmission by subverting Mendelian segregation at the expense of the Y chromosome.

In the Paris system, two distinct distorter elements have been fine-mapped to the cytological bands 7E-F of the sex-ratio reference chromosome XSR6: a segmental duplication and a second element located 100\xe2\x80\x93150 kb away (Montchamp-Moreau et al. 2006). We used males carrying XSR6 to produce a library of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC). We obtained, assembled, and analyzed a sequence of about 300 kb that contains the two distorter elements. This process allowed us to identify the limits of the segmental duplication and associated repetitive elements. We were also able to shed light on the mechanism and age of the duplication event, as well as the coding potential of the different components of the duplication. Two types of males were used: (XST8)ST8 males that carry the reference standard XST8 chromosome and (XSR6)ST8 males that carry the reference sex-ratio XSR6 chromosome. Both X chromosomes are in the same ST8 genetic background (drive-suppressor free). To prevent recombination, the X chromosomes were maintained in the male lineage through repeated backcrosses with C(1)RM, y, w (ST8 background) females, as described in Montchamp-Moreau and Cazemajor (2002). DNA extraction was performed on (XSR6)ST8 males. DNA was partially digested with HindIII and separated on a 1% agarose gel by pulse field gel electrophoresis. 27,648 BACs, each about 70 kb in length, were generated according to the protocols described in Roest Crollius et al. (2000). The BACs were spotted onto nylon membranes. To screen for those covering the sex-ratio domain previously described (Montchamp-Moreau 2006), we used 32P-labeled probes consisting of gene fragments scattered along the whole domain (supporting information, Figure S1). When the clones included a part of the duplication, they were sequenced for Trf2 and/or org-1, for which a known polymorphism was used to discriminate between the two copies (Derome et al. 2008). The BACs were sequenced by the Genoscope (Evry, France). A library was obtained for each of them after mechanical shearing of DNA and cloning of 3 kb (BAC 10c2 and 67l12) or 5 kb (BAC 58j14, 46o6, 35e19, and 24a6) fragments into a pcdna2.1 plasmid vector (Invitrogen). Additional libraries were prepared from BACs 58j14 and 46o6 by cloning 10 kb fragments into a pCNS plasmid vector (pSU18 derived). All vector DNA was purified and end-sequenced using dye terminator chemistry on ABI 3730 sequencers (Applied Biosystems, France) at \xe2\x88\xbc12\xc3\x97 coverage. The assemblies were realized using Phred/Phrap/Consed software package (www.phrap.com; Ewing et al. 1998; Ewing and Green 1998; Gordon et al. 1998). The sequences have been deposited in the EMBL database under accession numbers FQ660547 (46o6), FQ660548 (10c2), FQ660549 (58j14), FQ660550 (35e19), FQ660551 (24a6), and FQ660552 (67l12). The BACs were annotated using Apollo (Lewis et al. 2002). We performed BLAST analysis (Camacho et al. 2009) using the D. melanogaster genome as reference (http://flybase.org/, R5.29). When needed, the sequences were first aligned with ClustalW (Thompson et al. 2002) then manually aligned with BioEdit (Hall 1999; http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). The percentage of nucleotide identity between sequences was calculated using DnaSP (Librado and Rozas 2009). The repeated regions were analyzed with RepeatMasker (Chen 2004; Tarailo-Graovac and Chen 2009). Global alignment of the clones was conducted with PipMaker (Schwartz et al. 2000). The spread of chromosomes and the hybridization were performed according to the protocol described in Montchamp-Moreau et al. (2006). The probe was a fragment of Hosim1 (Figure 5 and sequence of primers in Table S1), amplified from DNA of (XSR6)ST8 males and cloned into PGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega). High molecular weight DNA was prepared from 300 mg of adult male (Roberts 1998). Four micrograms of each extract were digested overnight with 100 U BamHI or 100 U HindIII in 200 \xc2\xb5l final volume, precipitated after phenol/chloroform extraction, and resuspended in 30 \xc2\xb5l TE. Overnight electrophoresis was performed on 0.7% agarose gel in TAE 1\xc3\x97. The transfer onto nylon membrane (Amersham Hybon-N) was performed with a Amersham VacuGene XL Vacuum Blotting System. The probe consisted of 25 ng of Hosim1-SR PCR product (sequence of primers in Table S1) purified with Nucleospin DNA extract II (Macherey Nagel), and then labeled with \xce\xb1-32P dCTP using High Prime DNA Labeling Kit (Roche). After a two-hour prehybridization at 68\xc2\xb0C, the membrane was incubated overnight with the probe in 6\xc3\x97 SSC, 5\xc3\x97 Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, and 100 \xc2\xb5g/ml salmon sperm DNA, then washed twice in SSC 0.2\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x93SDS 0.2% and twice in SSC 0.1\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x93SDS 0.1%. The sequences of the primers are in Table S1. To estimate the copy number of Hosim1 elements per genome, we performed six independent DNA extractions from heads of 10 males for each stock under study, using a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The concentration of DNA was measured with a Quant-it dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen) in a Qubit fluorometer. Quantification was performed from 5 ng of DNA with a Chromo4 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) and Bio-Rad iQ SYBR-Green kit. The reference genes were GAPDH and RPL17 (autosomal genes showing no sequence polymorphism between and within fly stocks). The efficiency of amplification was close to 100% for the six sets of primers used. To detect and quantify Hosim1 transcripts, the testes from two-day-old males were dissected in PBS on ice and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted from samples of 30 testis pairs each, using a Nucleospin RNAII kit (Macherey-Nagel) following the manufacturer's protocol. For each stock, three independent RNA extracts were obtained. Two RT-PCR reactions were performed on each extract, using Bio-Rad iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit, and 2 ng of the resulting cDNAs were used for real-time PCR. The amount of transcript was standardized to the autosomal reference genes light and RPII140 that showed stable expression among samples (determined using Genorm (Vandesompele et al. 2002), Normfinder (Andersen et al. 2004), and Bestkeeper (Pfaffl et al. 2004)). The number of DNA copies and the amount of transcript in (XSR6)ST8 males relative to (XST8)ST8 males were estimated using the \xce\x94\xce\x94Ct method (Schefe et al. 2006). For each stock, the 95% confidence interval was calculated to assess the robustness and variance of our quantifications. The values were compared with a Mann-Whitney Test, using R (http://www.r-project.org/, function wilkox.test(A,B); R Development Core Team 2010). The sex-ratio chromosome XSR6 typically leads to 90\xe2\x80\x9395% female progeny in a suppressor-free background. We sequenced four overlapping BACs, named 58j14, 46o6, 35e19, and 24a6, covering 250 kb and including the candidates regions for the two distorter elements previously mapped on XSR6 (Figure S1, Figure S2). In addition, we partially sequenced BACs 10c2 and 67l12 to check the organization of the duplication. After assembling, we aligned the resulting sequence to the genome of D. melanogaster because there are numerous gaps and assembling errors in the published D. simulans genome. The synteny of the region appeared to be conserved between the two species (Figure S2) with 92.88% sequence identity on average. A single segmental duplication in tandem and direct orientation was detected. The duplicated fragment was found to be 37,500 bp in length (Figure 1) and contain six annotated genes. It started distally within the gene Trf2 (second intron) and ended within the gene org-1 (first intron). Of the four genes annotated in between, three had complete duplication: CG12125, CG1440, and CG12123. Analysis of their sequences did not reveal mutations that could affect their coding potential. In contrast, the distal copy of the fourth gene, CG32712, had a frameshift mutation caused by a 65 bp deletion within the second exon, which introduced an early stop codon. General organization of the sex-ratio duplication dot plot comparison of the duplication on the XSR6 chromosome of D. simulans (abscissa) with the homologous region in D. melanogaster (ordinate). The D. simulans sequence was obtained from BACs 58j14 and 46o6, which do not overlap (limits showed by the vertical dotted line). The black arrows show Hosim1-SR sequences (no homolog in D. melanogaster genome), separated by fragments with homologs in the second intron of Trf2 (IST). Two horizontal dotted arrows show the limits of the duplicated fragment. Examination of the candidate region for the second element revealed the presence of an approximately 1 kb fragment between the genes spirit and CG12065 that had no homolog in the D. melanogaster genome. This insertion also exists on standard X chromosomes of D. simulans and contains a small chromodomain-containing gene (759 bp), which is annotated in the D. simulans genome as GD16106 (Figure S2). Transcripts of GD16106 have been detected in the testis of both standard and sex-ratio males (D. Ogereau, unpublished data). The two copies of the duplication had a very high sequence identity score (99.49% for exons, 98.65% for introns). Figure 2 shows that nucleotide polymorphisms were not randomly scattered along the duplication: a 10,344 bp fragment was 100% identical between the two copies. This cannot be due to an assembling error because the procedure ensured that each copy of the duplication was cloned in a different BAC (see Materials and Methods and Figure S1). This remarkable similarity between the two copies is consistent with previous direct sequencing of markers located within the genes CG12123 and CG1440, which revealed a single sequence on chromosome XSR6 (Montchamp-Moreau et al. 2006). Sequence identity between the two copies of the sex-ratio duplication on the XSR6 chromosome. The analysis was performed using a 50 bp sliding window with a step size of 10 bp. The gray box represents the fragment with 100% identity; the striped box represents the region containing the DDSA traces described in Figure S3. The stars show the position of markers sequenced in the population study of Derome et al. (2008), and the triangle shows the position of the small deletion in the distal copy of CG32712. Outside of the identical 10,344 bp fragment, the mean identity was 98.75%, similar to the value obtained for this chromosomal region in a whole-genome analysis of polymorphism among seven independent lines of D. simulans (98\xe2\x80\x9399%) (Begun et al. 2007). This suggests that the duplication event occurred in the very recent past, through production of an exact copy on the donor chromosome itself. Polymorphism was later introduced by recombination. This hypothesis is consistent with experimental evidence that revealed that recombination occurs freely between the duplication and the homologous region of standard X chromosomes (Montchamp-Moreau 2006). We therefore propose a parsimonious three-step scenario for the observed duplication pattern of XSR6. First was a tandem duplication of a fragment on the same chromosome (Figure 3A), followed by two recombination events, one affecting the proximal copy of the duplication and the other the distal copy. Assuming that the duplication originated recently and retained the ancestral sequence across a large portion, we should find signatures of the mechanism that generated the XSR6 pattern. In D. melanogaster, analysis of double-strand break repair (DSB) after P-element excision shows that DSB repair usually occurs primarily through homologous repair and, preferentially, by synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) (Engels et al. 1990; Nassif et al. 1994; Rong and Golic 2003). The template sequence is usually the allele located on the homologous chromosome or on the sister chromatid, but an ectopic site is sometimes used and thus duplicated into the DSB site (Rong and Golic 2003). The duplication-dependent strand annealing (DDSA) model is a variant of SDSA occurring after a DSB in a repeated sequence; under the DDSA model, repair uses an ectopic site that contains this repeated sequence (Fiston-Lavier et al. 2007). (A) Parsimonious scenario explaining the pattern of sequence variation observed between the two copies of the sex-ratio duplication carried by the chromosome XSR6. The vertical dotted lines show the limits of the 10 kb fragment with 100% sequence identity. The stars show the position of markers sequenced in Derome et al. (2008). The triangles show the position of CG32712 (the white triangle stands for the deleted allele brought by recombination). The vertical gray/white strips represent the repeated motifs of the junction region. (B) Interpretation of Figure S1 in Derome et al. (2008). XM01 is a sex-ratio chromosome from Madagascar, carrying a combination of haplotypes commonly found there. For each marker (stars in Figure 3A), the ancestral sequence is symbolized in light gray. Alleles supposed to have been brought by recombination are in medium and dark gray (proximal recombination) and in black (distal recombination). The presence of repeated sequences at one end of the duplicated fragment suggests that the DDSA model can be applied to the sex-ratio segmental duplication. According to this model, instability of the DNA heteroduplex during repair leads to local dissociations of the nascent strand from the template. When reinvasion occurs within the same template, signatures of the repair mechanism can be found (Mcvey et al. 2004). A reinvasion upstream from the dissociation site leads to the formation of short tandem repeats within the neosynthesized copy, whereas a downstream reinvasion site that corresponds to a jump from the template causes a gap delimited by microhomology sequences within the neosynthesized copy (Fiston-Lavier et al. 2007). We analyzed the gaps in the alignment of the duplicated fragments carried by the XSR6 chromosome and, when possible, compared them to the sequences available in FlyBase (D. simulans, R1.3). We found five signatures of reinvasion in Trf2, within a fragment in which the distal copy is thought to have come from a standard chromosome via recombination (Figure 2). Three microhomologies and one tandem repeat indicated that the proximal copy was the neosynthesized sequence, whereas another tandem repeat indicated that the distal copy was the neosynthesized sequence (Figure S3). However, this latter trace can alternatively be explained by a polymerase slippage that occurred later in the proximal copy after the duplication event. The domain between the two copies of the segmental duplication consists of repeated modules. Each module is composed of fragments that are homologous to fragments in the second intron of the gene Trf2, which we called IST (intronic sequence of Trf2), that alternate with fragments that have no homolog on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster (Figure 1). These fragments correspond to Hosim1, a class II transposable element detected in the genome of D. simulans and D. sechellia using bioinformatics methods (de Freitas Ortiz and Loreto 2009). Hosim1 belongs to the herves transposable element family of the hAT superfamily. In D. simulans, the gene Trf2 contains two IST motifs located 704 bp apart (Figure 4A) that show 91.3% identity without the indels and 79.8% with the indels. This organization is conserved in D. melanogaster and D. sechellia. The motifs that alternate with Hosim1 have been rearranged; we thus called them rIST (for rearranged IST). The rISTs showed more than 99% identity with each other and were always organized in direct tandems between each copy of Hosim1. The same 8 bp in the rIST sequence were duplicated at the insertion site of each Hosim1 element. (A) Schematic representation of the canonical IST (Intronic Sequence of Trf2), found in the published D. simulans genome and in the distal copy of Trf2 on chromosome XSR6. (B) Organization of the junction region on chromosome XSR6, observed in BAC 58j14 (top) and BACs 67l12 and 46o6 (bottom). It consists of alternating Hosim1-SR elements and direct tandems of rIST.

The white boxes show the position of the main deletions in Hosim1-SR, with their size below (in bp). The star shows the localization of the intron presented in Figure S7. (a) Position of primers used to amplify both Hosim1 and Hosim1-SR transcripts (Figure 7), (b) position of primers used to estimate the number of canonical Hosim1 (Figure 6A), (c) position of primers used to estimate the total number of elements (Hosim1 + Hosim1-SR, Figure 6A), and the total amount of transcripts (Figure 6B). There was 100% identity among the Hosim1 copies associated with the duplication (excepted for a deletion of the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 part of the first element in the 58j14 clone). This finding suggests either that their amplification is very recent or that genetic conversion is frequent at this locus. We called these copies Hosim1-SR, because they were noticeably different from the four Hosim1 forms already annotated in the D. simulans genome [accession number CH986553, CH981769, CM000363, CH982471 (partial sequence)]. While the four canonical forms differ from each other by only 23 SNPs and a poly-T stretch, Hosim1-SR had four deletions in the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 noncoding region (Figure 5) and differed from the canonical forms by 28 SNPs. These differences, however, do not affect the size of the transposase predicted by ORF Finder (Rombel et al. 2002). Amino acid alignment with Hermes transposase showed that both Hosim1 and Hosim1-SR retained the DDE amino acids involved in the enzyme\xe2\x80\x99s function (Perez et al. 2005). Furthermore, both Hosim1 and Hosim1-SR contain the LDPR sequence that is characteristic of the majority of hAT transposable elements (Handler and Gomez 1997). The terminal inverted repeats (TIR) of Hosim1 are conserved in Hosim1-SR. While potentially active Hosim1-like elements (Hosec1) have been described in the genome of D. sechellia (de Freitas Ortiz and Loreto 2009), we found only one element, incomplete and diverging, in the D. melanogaster genome. Figure S4 shows a maximum likelihood tree obtained from the published sequences. First, we confirmed that the presence and amplification of Hosim1-SR at the junction of the duplicated segments was not due to a cloning artifact. We performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on polytene chromosomes with a probe targeting both Hosim1 and Hosim1-SR (Figure 5). In standard males (XST8)ST8 we detected two hybridization sites, on the chromosomal arms 3L (80A) and 2L (42C) (Figure S5). These sites correspond to the Hosim1 copies identified in the published D. simulans genome (accession number: CM000363 and CH986553, respectively). In (XSR6)ST8 males, which carry the sex-ratio XSR6 chromosome in the same autosomal background as (XST8)ST8 males, we observed an additional site in the cytological band 7E of the X chromosome. Thus, this extra signal colocalizes with the sex-ratio duplication (Montchamp-Moreau et al. 2006). Then, because of the potential impact on the expression level of neighboring genes, we checked the gene organization at the limits between the duplicated fragments and the intervening repeated region. We extracted DNA from (XSR6)ST8 males, and we used PCR to amplify fragments that overlap between org-1 and Hosim1-SR and those that overlap between Hosim1-SR and Trf2 (Figure 4B, a\xe2\x80\x93c). The sequences were found to be identical to those in the BACs. To check the organization of the junction region, we performed further screening of the BACs library and found two additional BACs (10c2 and 67l12, Figure S1) that contain a larger part of the junction region. We found no BAC that encompasses the whole region (i.e., that contains the adjacent end of the segmental duplication on both sides). The abundance of repeated motifs with very high similarity and rearrangements in clones made it impossible to completely sequence and assemble BACs 10c2 and 67l12. Nevertheless, we found only Hosim1-SR and rIST sequences in this region. The partial sequence assembly and the digestion of BACs 10c2 and 67l12 by HindIII (D. Ogereau, unpublished data) confirmed the organization proposed in Figure 4 and indicated that the junction region in 67l12 contains only Hosim1-SR/rIST/rIST modules. In addition, we performed Southern blots using high molecular weight genomic DNA and hybridization with a Hosim1-SR probe (Figure S6). HindIII digest produced bands shared by (XST8)ST8 and (XSR6)ST8 males, which likely correspond to autosomal copies. A restriction site is present in the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 region of Hosim1-SR but not in IST or rIST sequences (Figure S6B). Because (XSR6)ST8 males produced a strong specific band of \xe2\x88\xbc3.6 kb, it follows that the junction region contained mainly, if not exclusively, a succession of Hosim1-SR/rIST/rIST modules in the same orientation as found in clones 46o6 and 67l12. However, a light band of \xe2\x88\xbc4.3 kb was also observed, which should correspond to a module in the opposite orientation, as found in clone 58j14 (Figure 4). This could be the signature of sporadic rearrangements, possibly favored by the repetitive structure. According to the data provided by the BACs, the junction region contains at least six copies of Hosim1-SR (Figure 4). We also estimated directly on the XSR6 chromosome the total size of the repeated region using high molecular weight genomic DNA digested by BamHI. There is no BamHI restriction site in rIST and Hosim1-SR: the closest sites on either side of the junction domain are in the distal copy of org-1 (\xe2\x88\xbc1.6 kb apart) and in the 5th exon of the proximal copy of Trf2 (\xe2\x88\xbc10.1 kb apart). Hybridization of the Southern blot with a probe spanning the whole Hosim1-SR element revealed a large fragment estimated at 26\xe2\x80\x9336 kb, which corresponds to 4.1\xe2\x80\x936.9 copies of Hosim1-SR/rIST/rIST modules of \xe2\x88\xbc3.6 kb (Figure S6). We used real-time PCR to obtain an independent estimate of the number of transposable elements in the duplication. Again we used (XSR6)ST8 and (XST8)ST8 males, which differ only by the X chromosomes. First, the published Hosim1 form (de Freitas Ortiz and Loreto 2009) was specifically amplified using primers designed within the region deleted in Hosim1-SR [Figure 5,(b)] We observed a weak difference between the two types of males (1.15 times more copies in (XSR6)ST8 than in (XST8)ST8; P = 0.04), suggesting that there is no extra canonical Hosim1 on the XSR6 chromosome (Figure 6A). We quantified the total number of elements, Hosim1 plus Hosim1-SR, by amplifying a sequence located in the coding region shared by the two forms [Figure 5,(c)]. We found 2.76 times more copies in (XSR6)ST8 than in (XST8)ST8 males (P = 2.4 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9212, Figure 6A). According to the results of the FISH experiment (Figure S5), there should be four copies of Hosim1 in the autosomal genome shared by (XST8)ST8 and (XSR6)ST8 males (a single and homozygous copy at each autosomal site). Under this hypothesis, about 11 copies must be present in (XSR6)ST8 males and, consequently, seven copies on the XSR6 chromosome [confidence interval 95% (6.85\xe2\x80\x937.19)]. Quantification of Hosim1 copy number (A) and Hosim1 transcripts (B) by real-time PCR. The values in (XSR6)ST8 males were estimated relative to that in (XST8)ST8 males. Vertical bars: confidence interval (95%). (A, left) \xe2\x80\x9cCanonical\xe2\x80\x9d elements (see text). (A, right) Canonical elements plus Hosim1-SR. The reference genes were RPL17 and GAPDH. (B) Total amount of testicular transcripts (= Hosim1 + Hosim1-SR). Reference genes were light and RPII140. To determine whether Hosim1 and, in particular, the Hosim1-SR form are still active, we performed PCR on cDNA with a primer pair straddling the deletion characteristic of the Hosim1-SR form [Figure 5,(a)]. Transcripts were present in the whole body, in head, and in testes of both sex-ratio and standard males. We found that both forms were expressed in (XSR6)ST8 males and that the cDNA fragments were shorter than DNA fragments (Figure 7). Sequencing the shorter form revealed a 67 bp intron associated with Hosim1-SR (Figure S7). The splicing occurred for Hosim1 transcripts, too, but appeared to be less efficient [see (XST8)ST8 males in Figure 7]. In (XSR6)ST8 males, the splicing seemed to be more efficient in the testes. Real-time PCR showed that the total amount of testicular transcripts was about 90 times higher in (XSR6)ST8 males than in (XST8)ST8 males (Mann-Whitney test, P = 2.2 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9216, Figure 6B). Detection of Hosim1 transcripts by RT-PCR. The primers used straddle the deletion of 79 bp specific of Hosim1-SR [Figure 5,(a)], so this element must produce a shorter band (699 bp) than the canonical Hosim1 (784 bp). Even shorter fragments were obtained from cDNAs revealing an intron of 67nt (see text). Amplification of Trf2 with primers straddling an intron was used to control the lack of DNA contamination in the cDNA samples. NC, negative control (no cDNA nor DNA); SL, SmartLadder DNA ladder (Eurogentec); SR6, (XSR6)ST8 males; ST, (XST8)ST8 males. To test for the presence of transcripts that contain the IST or rIST sequences (light gray boxes in Figure 4), we designed primers that amplify both forms (Table S1); these noncoding motifs appeared to be transcribed, and more cDNAs were detected in (XSR6)ST8 males (Figure 8) than in (XST8)ST8. Detection of IST transcripts by RT-PCR. The IST and rIST probes were designed within the region shown in light gray in Figure 4. Amplification of Trf2 gene marker was used to control the lack of DNA in the cDNA samples (see Figure 7). SL, SmartLadder DNA ladder (Eurogentec); XSR6, (XSR6)ST8 males; XST8, (XST8)ST8 males. Here we provide evidence that the XSR6 chromosome carries a recent tandem segmental duplication of 37.5 kb that originated through the production of an exact copy on the donor chromosome itself and that changed the copy number of six genes. By contrast, the second element required for drive is not associated with rearrangement. Yet, in the candidate region, we noticed a small gene (GD16106) that does not exist in the D. melanogaster genome. The molecular data allowed us to propose a mechanism for how the duplication was generated and to retrace its history. The two copies of the duplicated chromosome fragment are separated by repeated modules, each of which contains a Hosim1 transposable element that has small deletions but that is potentially active, and tandem motifs derived from an intronic sequence of Trf2 (rIST). Amplification of the modules may be responsible for the additional dense band revealed after DAP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 coloration in the 7E section on the XSR6 polytene chromosome (Montchamp-Moreau et al. 2006), which reflects a local modification of the chromatin structure. The highly repeated nature of this region prevented its complete sequencing and assembly, but three independent methods indicated that the XSR6 chromosome carries six or seven modules. Organization like this is a potential source of instability and unequal crossovers; this instability likely produces variation in the number and organization of motifs among natural sex-ratio X chromosomes. About 25% of the tandem duplications detected in the genome of D. melanogaster show at least one repetitive element at the breakpoint (Fiston-Lavier et al. 2007). The local sequence organization, with two repeated modules 704 bp apart within Trf2, could have favored a double-strand DNA break. Alternatively, the transposable element may have generated the break; indeed Hosim1 is a class II transposable element that is mobilized by a DNA intermediate through a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98cut-and-paste\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 mechanism (de Freitas Ortiz and Loreto 2009). According to the DDSA model (Fiston-Lavier et al. 2007), a double-strand break within a repeated sequence (here IST or Hosim1) is repaired via homologous\xe2\x80\x93base pairing using another copy of this repeated sequence as template. The repair leaves specific signatures that were detected on the XSR6 chromosomes and that allowed us to identify the proximal copy of the duplication as the neosynthesized sequence. The organization of the junction domain between the duplicated fragments probably resulted from secondary amplification of repeated sequences. Testicular transcripts of the three fully duplicated genes CG12125, CG1440, and CG12123 had been detected using rtPCR in (XSR6)ST8 males, and a polymorphism in cDNA sequences led to the inference that both copies of CG12125 are active (Montchamp-Moreau et al. 2006). It was not possible to determine whether both copies of CG12123 and CG1440 are active because the distal and proximal copies are 100% identical. As none of the three genes on the XSR6 chromosome revealed any trace of frameshift or stop mutations, their duplication should result in quantitative changes in canonical transcripts. cDNA sequencing revealed that both copies of CG32712 are expressed in (XSR6)ST8 males (D. Ogereau, unpublished data). However, the 65 bp deletion in the second exon of the distal copy of CG32712 causes a nonsense mutation, so the associated mRNA cannot produce functional proteins. Other sex-ratio X chromosomes (e.g., XM01 depicted in Figure 3B) have been found to carry two 100% identical copies of the complete, likely original, proximal copy of XSR6. Thus, the deleted allele must have been introduced by recombination. As XSR6 shows strong drive ability, this suggests that CG32712 is not the distorter element in the duplication. Although Trf2 and org-1 are not fully duplicated, transcripts produced by both copies of each of these genes were found in the testis of (XSR6)ST8 males (Montchamp-Moreau et al. 2006). In the D. melanogaster subgroup, about 78% of new genes have arisen from duplications, and of these, 32% formed chimerical structures by recruiting flanking sequences into their coding region (Zhang et al. 2008). Located on either side of the junction domain of the sex-ratio duplication, the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 deleted copies of the Trf2 and org-1 genes are potential actors of such a process. The distal copy of org-1 lacks its first exon, which contains the start codon and the first 54 amino acids. The nearest Hosim1-SR element in the junction domain is in the opposite orientation (Figure 4B), suggesting that a chimerical transcript cannot be produced. Trf2 is more complex because two different Trf2 transcripts have been reported. Kopytova et al. (2006) described a long Trf2 transcript (\xe2\x88\xbc7.6 kb), thought to produce two proteins, one of 175 kD and one of 75 kD, that differed in their N-terminal domain; the shorter protein could have been produced via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Short transcripts (\xe2\x88\xbc3.9 kb), initially described by Rabenstein et al. (1999), can only produce the shorter protein. In the XSR6 chromosome, the proximal copy of Trf2 lacks the two first exons of the long transcript described by Kopytova et al. (2006). However, it could potentially produce the short transcript described by Rabenstein et al. (1999), and it retains the complete coding sequence for both proteins. The repeated sequences (Hosim1 and rIST) amplified in the junction region appeared well expressed in (XSR6)ST8 males: Hosim1 transcripts were found to be about 90 times more abundant in the testis of (XSR6)ST8 males than in (XST8)ST8 males (Figure 6B). As there are only 2.7 more Hosim1 copies in the genome of the (XSR6)ST8 males than in (XST8)ST8 males, either the Hosim1-SR form is expressed much more in the testis than the autosomal forms or there is a general overexpression of Hosim1 elements in sex-ratio males. We also detected cDNA containing IST/rIST sequences, although they are certainly noncoding (they are intronic sequences, and bioinformatics software did not detect any ORF). Such noncoding RNAs can be involved in a variety of processes, including dosage compensation, posttranscriptional gene silencing, regulation of transposable elements, and chromatin remodeling (Van Wolfswinkel and Ketting 2010). Because some rISTs and the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 deleted proximal copy of Trf2 are in the same orientation (Figure 4B), together they might produce chimerical transcripts. The 10,344 bp fragment of the sex-ratio duplication on the XSR6 chromosome with 100% identity between the copies (Figure 2) is too long to have arisen by gene conversion. We thus assumed that it represents the ancestral state, and no recombination with a standard X occurred in this region. This allows us to estimate the age of the duplication, assuming a conservative value of \xe2\x88\xbc2 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x928 recombination/bp/generation in the region (Derome et al. 2008; Derome et al. 2004; Montchamp-Moreau et al. 2006). As the probability of recombination or mutation is low, the number of these events follows a Poisson distribution (Sawyer and Hartl 1992). The probability of two copies of a fragment of size L remaining fully identical is given by the formula e-2(r+\xc2\xb5)Lt, where t = number of generations (10 per year) and \xc2\xb5 = mutation rate/bp/generation [\xc2\xb5 = 10\xe2\x88\x928 (Rozas et al. 2001)]. It follows that the duplication event likely took place less than 483 years ago (P = 0.05). That the duplication is so recent is well supported by previous molecular population genetics studies (Bastide et al. 2011; Derome et al. 2008). First, among the four marker loci that were surveyed, there was no fixed difference between the duplicated XSR and standard XST chromosomes sampled in the wild. In addition, these previous studies showed that most of the XSR chromosomes collected in Madagascar only 10 years ago still carried the presumed ancestral sequence with no trace of even a singleton mutation at these marker loci. The predominant variant found in this population could even have retained an ancestral fragment of larger size than that in XSR6 (Figure 3B). Thus, the structure of XSR6 is not exceptional among the present distorter X chromosomes. Note also that the region in between the identical 10,344 bp fragments may not have undergone recombination at all. If this is the case, then the duplication is younger than estimated above. Sex-ratio X chromosomes, however, can reach high frequencies in natural populations (\xe2\x89\xa550%) (Atlan et al. 1997; Jutier et al. 2004). In that case, the probability of recombination occurring between XSR and XST chromosomes would be lower than the overall recombination rate for the genome region, thus the duplication age could be more than 483 years. Segmental duplications are frequent on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster, but only 7.21% of them are more than 10 kb long. In addition, tandem duplications are almost always shorter than other duplications (Fiston-Lavier et al. 2007). This makes the sex-ratio duplication an exceptional event with regard to both its size (more than 37 kb) and its gene content. This kind of duplication is probably deleterious most of the time and, thus, destined to disappear quickly. In the present case, the duplication has a strong, negative effect on male fertility that is a direct consequence of drive (Angelard et al. 2008; Atlan et al. 2003; Atlan et al. 2004) and should cause many other perturbations via overexpression of the six duplicated genes or rIST and Hosim1-SR activity. In this respect, meiotic drive can be understood as a process that allows genetic rearrangements, such as duplications or inversions, to be maintained in the genome in spite of associated deleterious effects, as first proposed by Hedrick (1981). These rearrangements can persist for extended evolutionary periods, as demonstrated by one of the inversions associated with the sex-ratio trait in D. pseudoobscura with an apparent divergence time of about 1 million years (Babcock and Anderson 1996; Kovacevic and Schaeffer 2000). This allows time for the genetic innovation to coevolve with the host genome and eventually lead to a neutral or advantageous form. Now that the sequence of the reference chromosome XSR6 is known, precise study of gene expression is the next step in understanding the link between the duplication and sex-ratio meiotic drive. The duplication affects the copy number of six genes and is associated with several copies of an active transposable element and repeated modules that produce noncoding RNAs. Therefore, we must determine which of these components is involved in sex-ratio drive. In this respect, the duplicated XSR6 sequence will be a precious tool for analyzing polymorphism along this region among natural distorter chromosomes, with the goal of identifying a correlation between drive ability and duplication structure. It will also allow for the development of appropriate transgene constructs for the functional validation of candidate genes or sequences. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms that underlie the Paris sex-ratio drive should help us understand the evolutionary significance of segregation distorters.

The Pol II complex is composed of 12 subunits that are highly conserved from yeast to human (supporting information, Figure S1). The largest subunit, RPB1, is a \xe2\x88\xbc200 kDa multidomain protein that makes up much of the functional core of Pol II (Cramer et al. 2001). During transcription, dsDNA enters between the two lobes of the Pol II jaw-like structure, largely contacting the cleft domain of the RPB1 protein. At the base of the jaws lies the active site domain of RPB1. Although this is the domain primarily responsible for RNA polymerization, components of both the cleft and funnel domains are required for transcription as they allow translocation of the template DNA within the Pol II complex. Specifically, the trigger loop, located outside of the active site, is essential for proper catalysis by monitoring substrate selectivity as ribonucleotides pass through the RPB1 pore domain to the active site (Kaplan et al. 2008). In addition, interactions between the trigger loop and the bridge helix, an a-helix that spans the Pol II jaws, are thought to mediate the flexibility of the bridge helix that is important for translocation of the duplex DNA (Brueckner and Cramer 2008; Wang et al. 2006). Understanding the mechanism of Pol II transcription has been aided by specific inhibitors of this complex. The \xe2\x80\x9cdeath cap\xe2\x80\x9d mushroom toxin, \xce\xb1-amanitin, prevents transcriptional elongation in most eukaryotes by sterically blocking the intramolecular interactions between the trigger loop and bridge helix required for translocation (Brueckner and Cramer 2008; Kaplan et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2006). Mutations that confer \xce\xb1-amanitin resistance are mostly located in the \xe2\x80\x9cfunnel\xe2\x80\x9d domain of RPB1, a region close to the active site of the enzyme that contains the trigger loop (Bushnell et al. 2002). Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans were among the first to characterize mutations in the worm gene, ama-1/pb-1, and their effects on both \xce\xb1-amanitin binding and developmental processes (Rogalski et al. 1988; Rogalski et al. 1990; Rogalski and Riddle 1988). These studies mapped mutations within the ama-1 gene but did not identify the specific DNA changes mutations (Bullerjahn and Riddle 1988). The original collection of mutations represents a variety of ama-1 alleles, including \xce\xb1-amanitin\xe2\x80\x93resistant, hypomorphic, and putative null alleles. To further define the nature of these alleles, we sequenced a number of the original mutations and mapped them onto the highly homologous Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol II structure to provide potential structure-function information for these regions of the protein. We show that mutations that disrupt susceptibility to \xce\xb1-amanitin lie within the toxin binding site and that one of these also disrupts Pol II function at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, we identify mutations in conserved regions of the protein that cause significant alterations in RNA polymerase II function and provide further insight into its transcriptional mechanism.'","b'Mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans RNA polymerase II AMA-1/RPB-1 subunit that cause \xce\xb1-amanitin resistance and/or developmental defects were isolated previously.

The following mutations and balancers were used: wild-type N2 (Bristol); LG IV, V: ama-1(m322); ama-1(m118m526); ama-1(m118)dpy-13(e184); ama-1(m118m251)dpy-13(e184); ama-1(m118m238)dpy-13(e184); ama-1(m118m367m414)dpy-13(e184); ama-1(m118m396)dpy-13(e184)IV/nT1,V/nT1; ama-1(m118m235)dpy-13(e184)IV/nT1,V/nT1; ama-1(m118m236)dpy-13(e184)IV/nT1,V/nT1; ama-1(m118m332)dpy-13(e184)IV/nT1,V/nT1; ama-1(m118m370)dpy-13(e184)IV/nT1,V/nT1; ama-1(m118m370m417)dpy-13(e184)IV; and ama-1(m118m367)dpy-13(e184)IV/nT1,V/nT1. Two to four kilobytes of overlapping fragments of ama-1 were amplified by PCR from 10 animals of each genotype using high-fidelity Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and sequenced (Macrogen USA Sequencing). Sequencing covered the entire coding region, including introns and exons. The sequence was compared to the published wild-type F36A4.7 (ama-1) sequence on http://www.wormbase.org. For any mutation identified, the corresponding ama-1 fragment was independently amplified and sequenced to confirm that the mutation was not due to the amplification step. For mutant strains with early arrest phenotypes (DR811, DR880, DR877), heterozygous animals from balanced strains were used for amplification and sequencing, and a mutation was identified as a heterozygous (double) peak in the sequencing chromatogram. For any mutation identified in a balanced strain, the corresponding ama-1 fragment from homozygous ama-1 mutant worms [marked by dpy-13(e184)] were amplified and sequenced. To identify the possible structural alterations that lead to the observed phenotypes in ama-1 mutants, the amino acids altered in C. elegans ama-1 mutants were mapped to homologous amino acids in the S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II structure. Specifically, the C. elegans AMA-1 and S. cerevisiae RPB1 amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustal W (Thompson et al. 1994). S. cerevisiae amino acids homologous to C. elegans mutations were identified in one of two RNA polymerase II structures: PMID 3cqz (Kaplan et al. 2008) for analysis of \xce\xb1-amanitin-resistant mutations and PMID 2vum (Brueckner and Cramer 2008) for hypomorphic mutations. Worms were either maintained at 16\xc2\xb0 or shifted from 16\xc2\xb0 to 25\xc2\xb0 at either the L1 or L4 larval stage, and the phenotypes of their progeny were recorded. The total number of embryos produced by each animal and laid on the plates was counted to determine brood size. Embryonic lethality was recorded as the percentage of unhatched embryos after 24 hr. To assay gastrulation, embryos were probed using rabbit anti-PGL-1, which labels the primordial germ cells Z2/Z3, and DAPI to stain DNA as previously described (Schaner et al. 2003). Embryos were scored as gastrulation defective if Z2/Z3 were found to remain among the external layer of embryonic nuclei (Powell-Coffman et al. 1996). A large, valuable collection of mutant C. elegans worms with changes in the RNA polymerase II large subunit gene ama-1/rpb-1 was generated by EMS mutagenesis in the 1980s. This represents the second largest collection of metazoan mutants in ama-1/rpb-1, yet the identification of the corresponding changes in the ama-1 gene that result in these defects have remained unexplored. We have thus revisited this resource to further characterize these ama-1 mutations and to investigate their possible structural effects. \xce\xb1-Amanitin binds AMA-1/RPB-1 and blocks transcriptional elongation by preventing AMA-1/RPB-1 trigger loop\xe2\x80\x93mediated substrate selection and bridge helix flexibility during translocation (Brueckner and Cramer 2008; Bushnell et al. 2002; Kaplan et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2006). We sequenced two previously isolated mutants in the C. elegans ama-1 gene that demonstrated \xce\xb1-amanitin resistance (Rogalski et al. 1988; Rogalski et al. 1990; Rogalski and Riddle 1988). For one allele, ama-1(m118), we verified a mutation previously identified as a C777Y substitution (D. M. Bird and D. L. Riddle, unpublished). We also identified a novel C. elegans \xce\xb1-amanitin\xe2\x80\x93resistant mutation, ama-1(m322), as an R739H substitution (Table 1). Mapping these ama-1 mutations onto the S. cerevisiae structure of RPB1 showed that both mutations were in the trigger loop of the RPB1 \xe2\x80\x9cfunnel\xe2\x80\x9d domain (Figure 1). The arginine residue in yeast that is homologous to R739 in AMA-1, R726, provides a hydrogen bond with \xce\xb1-amanitin, suggesting that R739 performs a similar function in C. elegans (Figure 1B, Table 1) (Bushnell et al. 2002). An R to H change in the C. elegans protein would alter the distance critical for this hydrogen bond in the \xce\xb1-amanitin binding pocket and weaken this interaction. An identical substitution in the corresponding amino acid in Drosophila and in mouse cells has also been shown to inhibit \xce\xb1-amanitin binding [RpbII215-4; R741H (Chen et al. 1993; Coulter and Greenleaf 1982; Greenleaf et al. 1979); RpII215-A21, R749P, (Bartolomei and Corden 1995)]. Interestingly, the corresponding mutation in yeast suppresses a transcription start site defect [sit1-290, (Archambault et al. 1998)]. Structural position of C. elegans \xce\xb1-amanitin\xe2\x80\x93resistant mutations in the homologous S. cerevisiae structure. (A) Location of \xce\xb1-amanitin binding site in the S. cerevisiae Pol II structure (PDB ID: 3cqz) (Kaplan et al. 2008). \xce\xb1-amanitin (arrow) binds to the AMA-1/RPB-1 subunit between the \xe2\x80\x9cfunnel\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccleft\xe2\x80\x9d domains (light olive and bright green domains, respectively). (B) Stereo image of the location of amino acids corresponding to C. elegans \xce\xb1-amanitin resistance-inducing mutations. All amino acids changes are within the \xce\xb1-amanitin binding site and are conserved from yeast to C. elegans. The amino acid corresponding to m322 makes a hydrogen bond with \xce\xb1-amanitin. Figure rendered in PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3, Schr\xc3\xb6dinger, LLC, http://www.pymol.org). We also identified the mutations in an \xce\xb1-amanitin \xe2\x80\x9csuper-resistant\xe2\x80\x9d strain [DR1099: ama-1(m118m526)] that was isolated after further mutagenesis of the ama-1(m118) strain (Rogalski et al. 1990). The ama-1 gene in this strain carries a second mutation which creates a G785E transition which we predict to sterically block the \xce\xb1-amanitin binding pocket in the protein structure. Alteration of the corresponding amino acid also inhibits \xce\xb1-amanitin binding in the mouse protein (Bartolomei and Corden 1995). In addition to the high resistance to \xce\xb1-amanitin, DR1099 displays temperature-sensitive defects consistent with defective RNA Pol II function (Rogalski et al. 1990). ama-1(RNAi) embryos exhibit gastrulation defects and arrest at \xe2\x88\xbc120 cells (Powell-Coffman et al. 1996). Similarly, when DR1099 animals are shifted to a restrictive temperature (25\xc2\xb0), their embryos fail to gastrulate and arrest at \xe2\x88\xbc120 cells (Table 2). Importantly, however, immunofluorescence analyses of these embryos detected significant levels of an epitope that correlates with the elongating form of RNA Pol II, phosphorylation of Ser2 on the CTD repeat peptide [(Saunders et al. 2006); data not shown]. Thus, whereas RNA Pol II function is not completely compromised at the restrictive temperature, elongation processivity may be significantly affected, perhaps by a temperature-dependent mechanism that mimics inhibition of elongation by \xce\xb1-amanitin. This seems likely when considering the potential impact of G785E on the predicted structure. The bulky and charged E side-chain could insert within and disrupt the interface between the trigger loop and bridge helix of AMA-1 (Figure 1B). It is unclear, however, whether the effects of the G785E substitution are autonomous or exist only in the context of the second m118 C777Y substitution. Interestingly, residues that when altered confer \xce\xb1-amanitin resistance in C. elegans are also changed in the Giardia lamblia rpb1 gene, which is naturally \xce\xb1-amanitin resistant. The positions in Girardia rbp1 that correspond to those in C. elegans ama-1, and the amino acid differences between the species, are as follows: Ce R739 = Gl S851, Ce C777 = Gl S889, and Ce G785 = Gl S897 (Seshadri et al. 2003). Recessive-lethal alleles of ama-1 were also isolated through further mutagenesis of the ama-1(m118) strain. (Rogalski et al. 1988; Rogalski and Riddle 1988). The phenotypes of these mutants range from temperature-sensitive (ts) sterile (presumed hypomorphic allele) to L1 arrest (presumed null allele; i.e., phenocopies ama-1 deletion alleles). To better correlate Pol II structural alteration with phenotype, we sequenced ten of these mutants and mapped them onto the S. cerevisiae Pol II structure (Table 1, Figure 2A, B). The following mutations represent alterations in residues and domains that are highly conserved among yeast, worms, flies, and humans (see Figure S1 for AMA-1 sequence alignment). Positions of the C. elegans AMA-1/RPB-1 mutations mapped to corresponding residues in the homologous S. cerevisiae structure. (A) Comparison of location of mutations along the ama-1 sequence (exons in gray boxes) with previous fine-structure genetic map position (Bullerjahn and Riddle 1988). (B) Structural location of hypomorphic and null mutations in the Pol II structure (PDB ID: 2vum) (Brueckner and Cramer 2008). Domains and domain-like regions are identified according to Cramer et al. (2001); mutations are identified by their allele names. See Table 1 for allele descriptions. (C) Structural location of m251 in RPB-1/RPB-2 binding face.

(G) Structural location of m396 and hydrogen bonds to RPB5 R11 and R14 in 3cqz structure (Kaplan et al. 2008). Bond distance is indicated. Figure rendered in PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org). The ama-1(m370) mutation G636R, which yields a null-function phenotype, affects a residue predicted to lie at the cap of a beta sheet in the \xe2\x80\x9cpore\xe2\x80\x9d domain of AMA-1. This amino acid is in a tightly packed region of the Pol II protein, and the dramatic G to R residue change likely disrupts this packing and thus indirectly disrupts catalysis (Figure 2D). The ama-1(m370) strain DR880 [ama-1(m118m370)] was further mutagenized to identify suppressors of the ama-1(m370) lethal phenotype (Rogalski et al. 1988). We identified the presumed suppressing mutation in one of these strains, DR976: ama-1(m118m370m417), as an A746V conversion. Surprisingly, upon placement onto the yeast structure, the positions of G636 [ama-1(m370) mutation] and A746 [ama-1(m417) mutation] are predicted to lie at least 27\xc3\x85 apart within two different domains of AMA-1/RPB-1 (Figure 2D). G636 is predicted to lie within the pore domain, and A746 within the distant funnel domain. Further outcross experiments confirmed the very tight linkage of ama-1(m370) and ama-1(m417), supporting the conclusion that the suppression phenotype is indeed caused by the A746V conversion. A similar long-distance effect has been observed in Drosophila. The RpII215K1 mutation (D.m. S678N, S.c. S663) is found within the pore domain of Drosophila RPB-1 and causes a ts phenotype. This phenotype can be rescued by two different intragenic mutations in the funnel domain (RpII215R4: D.m. H713L, S.c. 698-Q; RpII215R10: D.m. S747L, S.c. 732-L), which are 49\xc3\x85 and 24\xc3\x85 away from RpII215K1, respectively (Chen et al. 1993; Krasnoselskaya et al. 1998; Mortin et al. 1988). Sequences of more internal revertants of ama-1 hypomorphs might reveal how common it is for intragenic revertants to exert their effects over long distances. The remaining five mutations identified in this study that are highly conserved residues all lie within the \xe2\x80\x9ccleft\xe2\x80\x9d domain of AMA-1/RPB-1 (Figure 2E) (Cramer et al. 2001). This domain makes up a large portion of the DNA binding region of the lower \xe2\x80\x9cjaw\xe2\x80\x9d of Pol II. The ama-1(m332) mutation V869M, which results in a null phenotype, corresponds to a residue in the S. cerevisiae structure that lies within a densely packed region of Pol II. While this particular amino acid is not conserved in yeast, it is in a very well conserved domain, and changing the small hydrophobic valine to a larger, more hydrophilic methionine may cause clashing with nearby side chains and disrupt this packing. The ama-1(m235) and ama-1(m367) mutants (G1086E and G1110E, respectively) correspond to yeast positions that are both found in the trigger loop of the cleft domain. This domain is thought to couple nucleotide recognition and catalysis during Pol II translocation, and substitutions at either glycine could decrease flexibility of the catalytically important bridge helix (Kaplan et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2006). The ama-1(m235) mutation is also in close proximity to Q838 in the bridge helix (Figure 2F). This contact is likely important because the sequence of the entire bridge helix is highly conserved, so the glycine to glutamate is presumably poorly tolerated. The G1110 residue does not contact the bridge helix directly, but it is also in a well-packed region of AMA-1. Conversion of G1110 to E in ama-1(m367) presumably disrupts packing in this domain. An EMS-induced revertant of ama-1(m367) (DR877) contained only the ama-1(m118) \xce\xb1-amanitin\xe2\x80\x93resistant mutation; the E1110 substitution had been converted back to glycine. The ama-1(m238) mutation G1406R results in temperature-sensitive, maternal-effect, embryonic-lethal phenotype. G1406 is predicted to be in the \xe2\x80\x9cswitch 1 domain\xe2\x80\x9d of the cleft domain, which is thought to be important for the Pol II conformational changes that allow template binding (Gnatt et al. 2001). Mutation of this amino acid in yeast causes cold sensitivity and slow growth by affecting transcription start site selection (Berroteran et al. 1994; Hampsey et al. 1991). The ts phenotype in C. elegans may involve a similar mechanism. The amino acid substitution in ama-1(m396), S1336F, is also found in the cleft domain and is specifically in the binding interface between RPB1 and RPB5 (Figure 2G). In yeast, the corresponding amino acid T1318 is predicted to have ionic interactions with R11 and R14 of the RPB5 subunit. This binding is likely conserved in C. elegans as this side-chain hydroxyl and the RPB-5 arginine residues are conserved (RPB-5 R10 and R13 in C. elegans), and mutation of this amino acid could disrupt RPB-1/5 interactions. Two mutations identified by sequencing resulted in amino acid substitutions in positions where there was little conservation. The ama-1(m251) mutation A363V has a temperature-sensitive, maternal-effect, embryonic-lethal phenotype. A363 corresponds to a glycine amino acid in yeast and a proline in flies and humans. Although the residue itself is not conserved, the surrounding residues are highly conserved among all four species, and it is located within the active site domain of yeast RPB-1 (Figure 2C). Although this mutation results in a conservative amino acid change, A363 is also predicted to lie within the RPB-1/RPB-2 interface, and disruption of this interaction may explain its ts phenotype. However, how a conservative change in C. elegans can affect AMA-1 function and yet maintain the normal protein as a proline in flies and humans is not understood. The ama-1(m236) mutation N1051I, which results in sterility and ts larval arrest, is predicted to lie within the AMA-1/RPB-1 \xe2\x80\x9cfoot\xe2\x80\x9d domain. The asparagine in C. elegans is a significant alteration relative to the other species, which have either serine (yeast) or threonine (fly and human). The surrounding amino acids are also significantly diverged, although this domain serves as a binding site for the yeast mRNA capping enzyme, CE (Suh et al. 2010). The yeast amino acid position corresponding to N1051 [T1038] lies on the edge of the CE electron density in the yeast Pol II\xe2\x80\x93CE cocrystal (Suh et al. 2010). It is likely that much of the structure of this region is devoted to the proper presentation of important/conserved residues for this interaction. Thus the N to I substitution might result in temperature-dependent instability in the interaction between the C. elegans\xe2\x80\x93capping enzyme and AMA-1. Sequencing these previously identified mutants of C. elegans ama-1 helps to complete mutagenesis studies done over 20 years ago. Overall, the positions of the mutations identified by sequencing closely match their positions originally determined by fine-structure genetic mapping (Figure 2A). The genetic results thus provide strong supporting data to conclude that the nucleotide changes identified are causative for the functional phenotypes observed in these mutants. We identified two novel C. elegans \xce\xb1-amanitin\xe2\x80\x93resistant mutations. One of these mutations, ama-1(m526), confers a tight ts, maternal-effect, lethal phenotype that may result from reduced efficiency of elongation, and it could be useful in further studies of Pol II function. In addition, assigning the structural positions of null and hypomorphic mutations may provide important structure-function clues for understanding how these mutations lead to different functional consequences that have biologic read-outs as different developmental phenotypes. Further biochemical analyses on the structure-function relationship of the mutations isolated from these early genetic screens will provide new information about the Pol II structure, and this emphasizes the mutual benefits that combined genetic and biochemical-structural approaches can provide. This article should serve as a valuable community resource for those seeking to understand such structure-function relationships, as well as those seeking to employ defined ama-1 mutations in their studies.

Foster']","November 4, 2011.",Double-Strand Break Repair and Holliday Junction Processing Are Required for Chromosome Processing in Stationary-Phase Escherichia coli Cells,"b'As nutrients are depleted and cell division ceases in batch cultures of bacteria, active processes are required to ensure that each cell has a complete copy of its genome. How chromosome number is manipulated and maintained in nondividing bacterial cells is not fully understood. Using flow cytometric analysis of cells from different growth phases, we show that the Holliday junction\xe2\x80\x93processing enzymes RuvABC and RecG, as well as RecBCD, the enzyme complex that initiates DNA double-strand break repair, are required to establish the normal distribution of fluorescent peaks, which is commonly accepted to reflect the distribution of chromosome numbers. Our results reveal that these proteins are required for the proper processing of chromosomes in stationary phase.The molecular processes by which bacterial cells replicate, repair, recombine, and partition their chromosomes during exponential growth have been extensively studied, but little is known about how DNA is manipulated during stationary phase when cells are not dividing. It is usually assumed that DNA metabolism ceases when cell division stops; however, at least three reports have documented that tritium-labeled thymidine can be incorporated into the genomic DNA of nondividing Escherichia coli cells (Boe 1990; Grivell et al. 1975; Tang et al. 1979). Evidence that DNA synthesis and recombination continue in stationary-phase cells is also provided by a phenomenon known as \xe2\x80\x9cadaptive mutation,\xe2\x80\x9d during which mutations occur in the absence of cell division. In the most-studied case, reversion to lactose utilization of Escherichia coli strain FC40, adaptive mutation requires recombination functions, proteins for double-strand break repair, and the DNA damage-induced DNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) (reviewed in Foster 2007). Taken together, these results suggest that DNA-related molecular processes continue into stationary phase, even in the absence of bulk chromosomal replication. As cells enter stationary phase, a complex cascade of events prepares them to survive famine conditions. Genes required for exponential growth are downregulated, and genes required for survival during starvation conditions are upregulated (Patten et al. 2004; Rahman et al. 2006). The chromosome is also reorganized and compacted, which can contribute to gene regulation but also protects the DNA from environmental and endogenous DNA-damaging agents [for examples, see Frenkiel-Krispin et al. (2004) and Nair and Finkel (2004)]. These changes in chromosome organization are largely due to several DNA binding proteins, some of which are upregulated in stationary-phase cells (reviewed in Dorman 2009). Interestingly, during the same period that this chromosomal reorganization occurs, transcription of the dnaN and recF genes, which are adjacent in a complex operon, is activated from promoters that are not used during exponential growth (Villarroya et al. 1998). dnaN encodes the replication processivity factor \xce\xb2, and recF encodes a protein involved in recombinational DNA repair. The increased expression of these proteins as cells enter stationary phase suggests that recombination processes continue to be important after genomic replication has ceased. Holliday junctions (HJ) are mobile four-stranded DNA structures that are formed during homologous recombination. To restore two intact double-stranded DNA molecules, HJs must be processed and resolved. E. coli has two pathways for processing HJs: the RuvABC resolvasome and the RecG translocase. RuvA and RuvB bind to HJs, hydrolyze ATP, and migrate the junction along the DNA. An interaction with RuvA stimulates RuvC to cleave the DNA, resolving the junction (reviewed in West 1997). RecG can also bind and migrate HJs; however, unlike the RuvABC resolvasome, RecG does not have an intrinsic ability to resolve the structure (Mcglynn and Lloyd 1999). While a need for HJ processing in stationary-phase cells has not been explicitly shown, RuvABC promotes and RecG inhibits stationary-phase adaptive mutation (Foster et al. 1996; Harris et al. 1996; Williams and Foster 2007). During normal cell growth, double-strand breaks can be caused by reactive oxygen species formed by normal cellular metabolism or failure of replication forks (for example, see Michel et al. 2007). Repair of DNA double-strand breaks via the RecBCD pathway leads to the formation of Holliday junctions. When a double-strand break occurs, the RecBCD complex binds to and processes the double-strand end, producing a 3\xe2\x80\xb2 single-strand overhang. RecA then catalyzes invasion of this strand into a homologous duplex, ultimately leading to the formation of one or two HJs (reviewed in Dillingham and Kowalczykowski 2008). RecBCD is also required for stationary-phase adaptive mutation (Harris et al. 1994), but to date, no other requirement for RecBCD in stationary-phase cells has been reported. Flow cytometric analysis of cell populations in batch cultures revealed that stationary-phase cells might contain one, two, four, or even eight chromosomes (\xc3\x85kerlund et al. 1995; Boye and L\xc3\xb8bner-Olesen 1991). Because DNA recombination activities are required for stationary-phase adaptive mutation, we sought to determine whether these activities also function in the establishment and/or maintenance of higher-order genomic structures. Specifically, we examined whether the RuvABC resolvasome, the RecG HJ translocase, and the RecBCD double-strand break repair machinery are required to generate the distribution of chromosome numbers that normally arises during early- to mid-stationary phase. The results presented here reveal that RuvABC, RecG, and RecBCD ensure proper chromosome processing during stationary phase.'","b'As nutrients are depleted and cell division ceases in batch cultures of bacteria, active processes are required to ensure that each cell has a complete copy of its genome.

Repair of DNA double-strand breaks via the RecBCD pathway leads to the formation of Holliday junctions. When a double-strand break occurs, the RecBCD complex binds to and processes the double-strand end, producing a 3\xe2\x80\xb2 single-strand overhang. RecA then catalyzes invasion of this strand into a homologous duplex, ultimately leading to the formation of one or two HJs (reviewed in Dillingham and Kowalczykowski 2008). RecBCD is also required for stationary-phase adaptive mutation (Harris et al. 1994), but to date, no other requirement for RecBCD in stationary-phase cells has been reported. Flow cytometric analysis of cell populations in batch cultures revealed that stationary-phase cells might contain one, two, four, or even eight chromosomes (\xc3\x85kerlund et al. 1995; Boye and L\xc3\xb8bner-Olesen 1991). Because DNA recombination activities are required for stationary-phase adaptive mutation, we sought to determine whether these activities also function in the establishment and/or maintenance of higher-order genomic structures. Specifically, we examined whether the RuvABC resolvasome, the RecG HJ translocase, and the RecBCD double-strand break repair machinery are required to generate the distribution of chromosome numbers that normally arises during early- to mid-stationary phase. The results presented here reveal that RuvABC, RecG, and RecBCD ensure proper chromosome processing during stationary phase. All bacterial strains used in this study are Escherichia coli K-12 derivatives and are described in Table 1. Cells of each strain were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Miller 1992) at 37\xc2\xb0 with aeration. After growth overnight, cultures were diluted 1:1000 into 25 mL fresh LB broth with no antibiotics in 125 mL flasks and grown at 37\xc2\xb0 with shaking. The optical density (OD600) was measured at each time point by removing appropriate samples of the cultures. In a separate experiment, samples were taken at comparable time points, diluted appropriately, and plated on LB 15% agar medium to determine the total number of colony-forming units (CFU). At each time point, 0.5 mL samples were removed from the 25 mL LB broth cultures and added to 4.5 mL of 78% ice-cold ethanol to produce a final concentration of 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were stored at \xe2\x88\x9220\xc2\xb0 until analysis. For analysis, the cells were first rinsed twice with 10 mL of 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4\xc2\xb0, then stained with propidium iodide in a solution of 0.2 mg/mL RNase (Sigma, R4875), 0.01% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA), and 3 \xce\xbcm propidium iodide (Sigma, P4864) in 1X PBS. DNA content was analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Approximately 50,000 cells were analyzed at a speed of 300 to 900 cells per second. The FL2-width (FL2-W) indicates relative cell size, and FL2-area (FL2-A) indicates total propidium iodide fluorescence. To examine how cell size might affect the fluorescence profiles, data analyses including different cell populations (gatings) were done. The overall fluorescence profiles were unaffected by these different gatings, so the histograms shown in Figures 3\xe2\x80\x937 and supporting information, Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S3, Figure S4, and Figure S5 represent the entire data set for each sample. Data analysis was performed using the FlowJo Version 8 for Mac (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). Overnight cultures were diluted by a factor of 105 into 50 mL fresh LB broth in 125 mL flasks and grown at 37\xc2\xb0 with shaking. The OD600 was monitored throughout the experiment. Samples were collected for CFU determination and 5-ethynyl-2\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling at 6.5\xe2\x80\x938.5 hr (exponential phase; OD600 = 0.6 \xc2\xb1 0.1), 8.5\xe2\x80\x9311 hr (stationary phase; OD600 = 1.5 \xc2\xb1 0.1), and 21 hr (late-stationary phase; OD600 = 1.8 \xc2\xb1 0.04) after inoculation. The times of sampling differed from strain to strain depending on growth rate. Cells were labeled with EdU using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Azide Imaging Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; #C10337) as in Ferullo et al. 2009. Briefly, 2 mL aliquots of culture were added to tubes with 24 \xce\xbcL of 10 mm EdU and incubated for 15 min at 37\xc2\xb0 with shaking. Cells were fixed with 90% methanol and stored at 4\xc2\xb0 for 3\xe2\x80\x938 days. Repeated experiments confirmed that storage time did not affect results. For analysis, cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized in a 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS solution for 30 min at room temperature, washed again with PBS, suspended in Click-iT reaction mixture, and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with reaction rinse buffer and suspended in PBS. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon 80i microscope with a FITC HYQ filter (Nikon Instruments, Inc., Melville, NY). Phase-contrast and fluorescence images were viewed and captured as described below. The number of CFUs was determined as described above. Phase-contrast microscopy of unfixed cells was performed using a Nikon 80i microscope (Nikon Instruments). The phase images were viewed using a Nikon Plan Apo 100X objective (Nikon Instruments), and the images were captured using a Photometrics Coolsnap HQ2 camera (Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ) and Metamorph image software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Representative fields of view are shown in the figures. As shown in Figure 1A, the growth rates of the recG258, ruvA60, recB21, and recG258 ruvA60 mutant strains differed little from that of the wild-type strain. Based on a least-squared fit of the linear parts of the curves in Figure 1A, the growth rates of the mutant strains differed from that of the wild-type strain by no more than 15%. All the mutant strains had somewhat longer lag phases than the wild-type strain; the longest was the lag phase of the recG258 ruvA60 double-mutant strain, which was about twice that of the wild-type strain. All of the strains reached comparable final optical densities. In the discussions below, we consider the 7\xe2\x80\x939 hr time period to be the entry into stationary phase and all times after 11 hr to be stationary phase. As measured by CFUs, after about 40 hr, the culturable cell number began to slowly decline, so that by 80 hr after inoculation only 10\xe2\x80\x9330% of the cells could produce colonies on LB agar (Figure 1B). Growth parameters and viability of wild-type and recombination-defective strains over time. (A) Optical densities measured at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) are plotted against the time (in hours) after inoculation. Samples were removed from the cultures at each time point marked. (B) At each time point, samples were collected from cultures started by diluting overnight cultures by a factor of 105 into fresh LB medium; the number of colony-forming units was determined by appropriate dilution and plating on LB agar. The number of cells per milliliter is plotted on a logarithmic scale against the time (in hours) after inoculation. Diamonds = FC36 (wild-type); triangles = FC457 (recG258); circles = FC484 (ruvA60); squares = FC400 (recB21); dashes = FC513 (recG258 ruvA60). Loss of recombination functions can induce the SOS response, leading to cell filamentation (Chua et al. 1993; Lloyd and Buckman 1991; Mccool et al. 2004; Witkin 1976). We used flow cytometric analysis of fixed and propidium iodide\xe2\x80\x93stained cells to examine the morphological heterogeneity of the wild-type (FC36) and isogenic mutant strains during the course of our experiments. Approximately 50,000 cells of each strain were analyzed, and each cell is represented by a dot in the plots shown in Figure 2. The magnitude of the FL2-W parameter is determined by the amount of time each cell remained in the path of the laser beam and is thus a measure of cell size. In each panel of Figure 2, the FL2-W value of each cell (vertical axis) is plotted against its relative fluorescence intensity (horizontal axis). Plots from several time points during the course of incubation are presented. As the plots show, the great majority of the cells in all the cultures were approximately the same size as the wild-type cells, but the cultures of the mutant strains also contained larger, presumably filamenting cells. With the exception of the 4 hr time points, the distributions of cell sizes of the recG258 and recB21 mutant strains were most similar to that of the wild-type strain, whereas the ruvA60 and recG258 ruvA60 mutant strains showed the greatest increase in the proportion of larger cells. These results were confirmed by the phase-contrast images in Figures 3\xe2\x80\x937 and Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S3, Figure S4, and Figure S5, which show that the morphology of the wild-type strain was constant throughout the course of the experiment but that the cultures of the mutant strains contained both normal and filamenting cells. The reason for the large variation in cell size in the recB21 mutant strain 4 hr after inoculation is not clear, but it could be due to double-strand breaks that formed in the stationary-phase cells that were used as the inoculum; as the cells began to divide, these breaks would then induce the SOS response and filamentation. Nonetheless, even in the strains mutant for double-strand break repair, HJ processing, or both, the majority of cells were of normal size and morphology during the course of these experiments. In Figures 3\xe2\x80\x937 and Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S3, Figure S4, and Figure S5 presenting flow cytometry data, the histograms include the entire cell populations, as omission of the larger cells had no noticeable impact on the final plots. Effects of recombination defects on cell size. The relative FL2-W values (cell size) are plotted against the relative FL2-A values (total propidium iodide fluorescence) in arbitrary units. Increasing values on the Y-axis indicate larger cells, and increasing values on the X-axis indicate greater total propidium iodide fluorescence intensity. Populations of cells with distinct fluorescence intensities develop during growth and stationary phase of the wild-type strain. Propidium iodide\xe2\x80\x93stained cells of the wild-type strain (strain FC36) were analyzed by flow cytometry at the indicated time points. (A) The numbers of cells (Y-axis) are plotted against their relative fluorescence intensities (X-axis). The histograms from the time points indicated are aligned along the Z-axis. (B) Phase-contrast micrographs of unfixed cells from the time points indicated (1000\xc3\x97 magnification). As shown in Figure 3A, as wild-type cells progressed through stationary phase, populations of cells with different fluorescence intensities developed. Previous studies have identified the two separate fluorescent peaks that develop in LB-grown cultures early in stationary phase to consist of cells containing two (lower fluorescence intensity) or four (higher fluorescence intensity) chromosomes (\xc3\x85kerlund et al. 1995). For the remainder of this article, the low fluorescence intensity peak is referred to as peak 1, and the higher fluorescence intensity peak is referred to as peak 2. In our experiments, the wild-type strain contained predominantly cells in peak 2 until 28 hr postinoculation, and then a population of cells in peak 1 developed between 28 and 44 hr postinoculation. The fluorescence profile of our strain at 44 hr postinoculation was similar to that obtained at 28 hr postinoculation by \xc3\x85kerlund and Colleagues (1995), except our cultures had a higher proportion of cells in peak 1. In addition, we did not see the small peak at even higher intensity that \xc3\x85kerlund et al. (1995) identified as cells with eight chromosomes. These differences are probably due to media composition: we used LB whereas \xc3\x85kerlund et al. (1995) used LB plus glucose. The phase-contrast images in Figure 3B show that up to 44 hr postinoculation, the morphology of wild-type cells did not vary noticeably. As shown in Figure 4A, the fluorescence profiles of a strain defective for the RecG translocase were similar to those of the wild-type strain during growth and early-stationary phase. However, the recG mutant strain was slow to develop the large peak 1 cell population that was present in the wild-type population by 36 hr postinoculation. Figure 4B shows that some filamentous cells were present in the culture of the recG258 mutant strain; however, cells of normal size and shape dominated the culture at all time points sampled. The Holliday junction\xe2\x80\x93migrating protein RecG is required for the development of normal fluorescent population dynamics during stationary phase. Propidium iodide\xe2\x80\x93stained cells (strain FC457) were analyzed by flow cytometry at the indicated time points. (A) The numbers of cells (Y-axis) are plotted against their relative fluorescence intensities (X-axis). The histograms from the time points indicated are aligned along the Z-axis. (B) Phase-contrast micrographs of unfixed cells from the time points indicated (1000\xc3\x97 magnification). To further examine the role of HJ processing, we analyzed a strain carrying the ruvA60 mutant allele that inactivates the RuvABC HJ resolvasome. As shown in Figure 5A, the fluorescence profiles of the ruvA60 mutant strain were similar to those of the wild-type strain up to 28 hr postinoculation; however, the ruvA60 mutant strain failed to develop the peak 1 population by 44 hr postinoculation. The phase-contrast images in Figure 5B show that, like the recG258 mutant strain, the population of the ruvA60 mutant strain contained filamenting cells, although again, most cells were of normal size and shape. The Holliday junction\xe2\x80\x93processing RuvABC complex is required for normal fluorescent population dynamics during growth and in stationary phase. Propidium iodide\xe2\x80\x93stained cells (strain FC484) were analyzed by flow cytometry at the indicated time points. (A) The numbers of cells (Y-axis) are plotted against their relative fluorescence intensities (X-axis). The histograms from the time points indicated are aligned along the Z-axis. (B) Phase-contrast micrographs of unfixed cells from the time points indicated (1000\xc3\x97 magnification). In a recG258 ruvA60 double-mutant strain, HJs cannot be processed. As shown in Figure 6A, the distributions of fluorescence intensities at all time points for this strain were very different from the wild-type strain. A peak 1 population appeared during exponential phase (as well as what appears to be a peak of even lower intensity that could correspond to cells with one chromosome), briefly disappeared as the cells entered stationary phase, and then reappeared at 13 hr postinoculation, a time earlier than when a similar population appeared in the wild-type or the single mutant strain. However, the peak 1 population did not become dominant, even in late-stationary phase, suggesting that HJ processing is required for cells to enter this population. The morphologies of cells are shown at sample time points in Figure 6B. Loss of both Holliday junction\xe2\x80\x93processing pathways severely alters fluorescent population dynamics during growth and in stationary phase. Propidium iodide\xe2\x80\x93stained cells (strain FC513) were analyzed by flow cytometry at the indicated time points. (A) The numbers of cells (Y-axis) are plotted against their relative fluorescence intensities (X-axis). The histograms from the time points indicated are aligned along the Z-axis. (B) Phase-contrast micrographs of unfixed cells from the time points indicated (1000\xc3\x97 magnification). Loss of RecB alters fluorescent population dynamics during growth and in stationary phase. Propidium iodide\xe2\x80\x93stained cells (strain FC400) were analyzed by flow cytometry at the indicated time points. (A) The numbers of cells (Y-axis) are plotted against their relative fluorescence intensities (X-axis). The histograms from the time points indicated are aligned along the Z-axis. (B) Phase-contrast micrographs of unfixed cells from the time points indicated (1000\xc3\x97 magnification). HJs are formed during repair of double-strand breaks by the RecBCD complex. To test whether RecBCD was required for changes in fluorescence, we analyzed the distributions of fluorescence intensities in the population of the recB21 mutant strain at various points during incubation. As shown in Figure 7A, the fluorescence profiles of the recB21 mutant strain were very similar to those of the recG258 ruvA60 double-mutant strain: peak 1 appeared during exponential phase, briefly disappeared as the cells entered stationary phase, and then reappeared but never became dominant. This result suggests that double-strand break repair is required for the development of the peak 1 population observed in wild-type cultures. As shown in Figure 7B, few filamentous cells were observed in the recB21 culture in stationary phase. The lack of filamentation indicates that the SOS response was not induced in this strain to the extent that it was in the other mutant strains tested, a result previously reported by Chua et al. (1993). This could be because the RecA loading activity of RecBCD is required to produce the SOS-inducing signal, and this function cannot be performed by the alternative double-strand break repair enzyme RecFOR (Ivan\xc4\x8di\xc4\x87-Ba\xc4\x87e et al. 2006). The fluorescence profiles of all of the strains tested were dynamic even to 44 hr postinoculation or approximately 30 hr after the onset of stationary phase. To determine whether further changes in the population distributions occurred, we continued the analysis to 72 hr postinoculation, although these results should be considered with caution as a large proportion of the cells in each culture were not culturable at these late time periods (see Figure 1B). The fluorescence profile of the wild-type strain was stable from 44 hr to 72 hr postinoculation, and that of the recG258 mutant strain was similar to wild-type but slightly slower to stabilize (see Figure S1 and Figure S2). In each of the other mutant strains, a large population of cells in peak 1 eventually developed, but these peaks developed slowly, particularly in the ruvA60 recG258 double-mutant strain (see Figure S3, Figure S4, and Figure S5). To determine whether ongoing DNA synthesis in the recombination mutant strains could explain our results, we tested whether these strains incorporate EdU, a thymidine analog, into their DNA during stationary phase. Incorporated EdU can be detected by a cycloaddition reaction with a fluorochrome-tagged azide, yielding a fluorescent product (Ferullo et al. 2009; Salic and Mitchison 2008). At the appropriate growth stage, cells were incubated briefly with EdU to allow incorporation; they were then fixed, reacted with the Click-iT reagent, and imaged using fluorescence microscopy. Images of cells in exponential phase revealed that greater than 90% of the cells of the wild-type, recG, recB, and ruvA mutant strains contained foci, whereas only 74% of the cells of the ruvA recG double-mutant strain contained foci (Table 2 and Figure S6). These results indicated that, as expected, most exponential-phase cells were synthesizing DNA, although fewer were in strains defective in double-strand break repair and HJ processing. Images of cells in early-stationary phase revealed substantial decreases in the numbers of cells that could incorporate EdU (Table 2). Less than 20% of the cells of the wild-type, recB, and recG mutant strains contained foci, and only 1\xe2\x80\x932% of the cells of the ruvA mutant and ruvA recG double-mutant strains contained foci. These results indicate that DNA synthesis was mostly completed by early-stationary phase. No fluorescent foci were detected in any cells exposed to EdU after about 12 hr into stationary phase, even though nearly all of the cells were culturable (Figure 1B). These results indicate that DNA synthesis, at least at the level required for detection by EdU incorporation, had ceased in all cells by this time. An alternative is that cells in late-stationary phase cannot incorporate EdU; however, this explanation is unlikely as previous work has shown that such cells can incorporate tritium-labeled thymidine (Tang et al. 1979). While the most severe abnormalities in DNA content in stationary-phase cells, as detected by fluorescence profiles, were seen in the recB21 and recG ruvA mutant strains, these strains had different amounts of EdU incorporation in stationary phase (17% and 1%, respectively). Thus, it is unlikely that ongoing DNA synthesis in stationary phase explains the differences in fluorescence profiles that we observed among the mutant populations. The data described in this study reveal new details about how E. coli cells maintain their genomic organization during various phases of growth. Using flow cytometric analysis, we showed that in cultures of wild-type cells, two primary cell populations with different amounts of DNA develop as the cells enter stationary phase (peak 1 and peak 2 populations); these populations correspond to those previously reported to contain two and four chromosomes (\xc3\x85kerlund et al. 1995). In our experiments, these distinct populations did not develop in cultures of the wild-type strain until 36\xe2\x80\x9344 hr postinoculation, which was 18\xe2\x80\x9326 hr after the onset of stationary phase. These times are several hours later than reported by \xc3\x85kerlund et al. (1995), most likely because our cultures were grown in the commonly used LB medium, whereas in \xc3\x85kerlund et al. (1995), the cultures were grown in the richer LB plus glucose medium. Our data show that the development of the typical biphasic population distribution was inhibited or delayed in cultures of strains mutant for HJ processing or double-strand break repair. A striking aspect of these results is that these distributions continued to develop throughout stationary phase, even up to 72 hr postinoculation. The recG258 ruvA60 double-mutant strain, which is unable to process HJs, was the most defective in developing distinct peak 1 and peak 2 populations (Figure 6). HJs are an intermediate in the repair of double-strand breaks by the RecBCD pathway. That loss of the RecBCD enzyme, which initiates this pathway, had a phenotype similar to loss of HJ processing (Figure 7) strongly suggests that the repair of double-strand breaks in stationary phase is required for the development of the populations detected by cytometric analysis. In our experiments, the effects of inactivating these repair pathways were manifested as cells entered stationary phase; however, the precise temporal requirement for their activities is not clear, and at least two scenarios are possible. The first scenario is that the activities of these proteins are required to repair the endogenous DNA damage that occurs during exponential growth to ensure that genome-processing events in stationary phase occur smoothly. The second scenario is that their activities are required for genome-processing events during stationary phase. Depending on when these repair proteins act in this genome-processing pathway, different models can be proposed to explain their roles. One explanation for the requirement of these proteins for stationary-phase chromosome processing is that they are involved in ongoing repair of endogenous DNA damage that occurs during exponential growth to ensure that the chromosomes are free of damage before the cells enter stationary phase. This ongoing repair ensures that the chromosomes are intact and ready for efficient processing as cells enter stationary phase. Thus, in wild-type cultures, most cells enter the peak 1 population rapidly during stationary phase. In contrast, cells of the repair mutant strains could arrive at the onset of stationary phase with damaged chromosomes due to failed repair of DNA damage that occurred during exponential growth. This unrepaired damage could block or slow late-stage chromosome processing pathways (such as chromosome partitioning), causing the persistence of cell populations with higher DNA content during stationary phase. In support of this model, earlier studies by Ishioka et al. (1998, 1997) and more recent studies by Rudolph et al. (2009a, 2009b) have demonstrated that the RecG and the Ruv pathways are required to ensure proper chromosome segregation, at least in UV-irradiated and multiply repair-defective cells. If the activities of these repair proteins are required after exponential growth as cells enter stationary phase, then at least three possible explanations can be proposed. One explanation is that cells continue to divide late into stationary phase, partitioning their DNA to daughter cells by a mechanism similar to, but slower than, that of exponentially growing cells. The energy required for this active process could come from the metabolism of nutrients released from dead cells in the culture. If this hypothesis is correct, then HJ processing and double-strand break repair would be implicated in chromosome partitioning, or perhaps decatenation, in late-stationary phase. Normal chromosomal decatenation after DNA replication is a function of the XerCD and FtsK proteins (Grainge et al. 2007), and the RuvABC, RecG, and RecBCD proteins have not previously been implicated in this process. However, cells in late-stationary phase might need HJ processing and double-strand break repair because of increased DNA damage from genotoxic agents that accumulate in the medium. A second explanation is that the peaks detected by flow cytometry do not consist of populations of cells with different numbers of chromosomes or different amounts of DNA, but instead, consist of populations of cells with different degrees of DNA compaction. During stationary phase, chromosomes are compacted via their association with DNA binding proteins, which include HU (Sarkar et al. 2007), MukB (Cui et al. 2008), and Dps (Frenkiel-Krispin et al. 2004). This compaction may decrease the ability of dyes like propidium iodide to bind the DNA duplex, resulting in the decreased fluorescence detected during flow cytometric analysis. Previous studies using flow cytometry of E. coli cells have not considered this possibility (\xc3\x85kerlund et al. 1995; Boye and L\xc3\xb8bner-Olesen 1991). This second hypothesis is particularly interesting, as it proposes that RuvABC, RecG, and RecBCD are involved in chromosome remodeling during stationary phase. Finally, a third and perhaps less likely explanation is that controlled DNA degradation occurs during late-stationary phase until the cells have uniform chromosome numbers. Such DNA degradation has not been reported previously, but it would explain the apparent reduction in DNA content (increase in numbers of cells with lower fluorescence intensity) that occurs in wild-type cells in the absence of cell division. Why HJ processing and double-strand break repair would be required for this process is not clear, but such a requirement would represent novel functions for these proteins. A converse possibility is that DNA replication, but not cell division, may continue longer into stationary phase in the mutant strains than in the wild-type strain, resulting in a higher proportion of cells with more DNA (increase in numbers of cells with higher fluorescence intensity); however, as shown in Table 2, we were unable to detect the DNA synthesis that would be required in the mutant strains if this hypothesis were true. That DNA manipulation continues in late\xe2\x80\x93stationary-phase cells is supported by several other observations. First, expression of E. coli\xe2\x80\x99s three inducible, specialized DNA polymerases, DNA Pol II, Pol IV, and Pol V, continues for days after cells reach stationary phase (Yeiser et al. 2002). In addition, the error-prone Y-family Pol IV is upregulated in late\xe2\x80\x93stationary-phase cells under control of the stationary-phase sigma factor, RpoS (Layton and Foster 2003; Storvik and Foster 2010). The reason for this late induction is not fully understood; however, Pol IV has been hypothesized to synthesize DNA during recombination-dependent DNA repair leading to adaptive Lac+ mutations (Foster 2000; Mck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nzie et al. 2001; Tompkins et al. 2003). As mentioned above, the DNA polymerase processivity factor DnaN and the RecA-loading factor RecF are also induced in stationary phase (Villarroya et al. 1998), further supporting the idea that DNA repair and recombination occur even in the absence of bulk DNA replication and cell division. This work has demonstrated the requirements of RuvABC, RecG, and RecBCD for establishment and/or maintenance of DNA content in stationary-phase cells. Determining whether double-strand break repair and HJ processing are required during exponential growth to \xe2\x80\x9cset the stage\xe2\x80\x9d during stationary phase for proper genome processing, for chromosome partitioning and/or reorganization, or for controlled DNA degradation will require further experimentation. For example, artificially inducing double-strand breaks at various points in the cell cycle might elucidate when double-strand break repair functions are required. Further research is needed to understand fully the molecular processes that allow nondividing cells to manage their DNA content and chromosome organization, and our data suggest that flow cytometry is a useful technique for such investigations.

These proportions are consistent with previous reports, and there was good agreement (\xce\xba = 0.63) between the modules. Alternative isoform usage between the sexes was identified for 164 genes. The SNP module was verified with resequencing data. Concordance between resequencing and the chip design was greater than 99%. The design also proved apt in separating alleles based upon hybridization intensity. Concordance between the highest hybridization signals and the expected alleles in the genotype was greater than 96%. Intriguingly, allelic imbalance was detected for 37% of 6579 probe sets examined that contained heterozygous SNP loci. The large number of probes and multiple probe sets per gene in the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression and exon modules allows the array to be used in D. melanogaster and in closely related species. The SNP module can be used for allele specific expression and genotyping of D. simulans.Gene expression analysis has proceeded from a primary focus on overall transcript level (Schena et al. 1995; Ross et al. 2000; Rifkin et al. 2003) to more sophisticated analyses, including those that examine expression of different isoforms (Johnson et al. 2003; Kwan et al. 2008) or individual alleles (Lo et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2009). Commercial platforms exist for measuring 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression or exon expression; however, there is not a single cost-effective platform for measuring expression at multiple levels. This article presents an array with three modules: 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression, exon, and SNP probes for Drosophila. In diploid organisms, expression from two, potentially different, copies of each gene contribute to transcript level and subsequent protein production. Unequal expression of these alleles is termed allelic imbalance (AI). AI is observed in model organisms and humans (e.g., Lo et al. 2003; Guo et al. 2008; Graze et al. 2009; Zhang and Borevitz 2009). AI is a factor in predisposition to complex diseases (Meyer et al. 2008; de la Chapelle 2009) and contributes to phenotypic variation in human populations (Johnson et al. 2005; Pickrell et al. 2010). For example, AI is associated with the risk of developing breast cancer (Meyer et al. 2008) and colorectal cancer (de la Chapelle 2009). AI has a genetic (as well as epigenetic) basis (e.g., Pastinen et al. 2004; Serre et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008; Verlaan et al. 2009). Exciting new developments in the study of complex diseases revealed regulatory polymorphisms contributing to the evolution of gene regulation (e.g., Emerson et al. 2010). Whole-genome associations of gene expression and phenotype identify the genetic basis of disease and other important phenotypic variation (Stranger et al. 2007; Nica and Dermitzakis 2008; Nica et al. 2010). AI identifies causal cis regulatory variants (Wittkopp et al. 2004). Allele-specific association studies advance these analyses and increase scientific knowledge of the regulatory process (Rockman and Kruglyak 2006; Serre et al. 2008; Stamatoyannopoulos 2004). Analysis of AI is an important next step in identifying the genetic basis of expression differences. AI has been assayed with pyrosequencing (Ahmadian et al. 2000; Wittkopp et al. 2004), targeted SNP typing arrays (e.g., Serre et al. 2008), high-density array designs (e.g., Zhang and Borevitz 2009), RNA-Seq\xe2\x80\x93based methods (Zhang et al. 2009 ; McManus et al. 2010; Pickrell et al. 2010), and smaller-scale methods, such as allele-specific qPCR (Szab\xc3\xb3 and Mann 1995). This article presents a custom array for measuring 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression, exon expression (and thus alternative splicing), and AI. The array has been designed for Drosophila on an Affymetrix platform (UFL Custom Dros_snpa520726F Array Format: 49-7875; available for purchase from Affymetrix). The use of a single platform is cost effective, and statistical analysis is simplified by the single hybridization. We designed 60,118 D. simulans SNP probe sets from previously reported SNP variants (Benson et al. 2005; Begun et al. 2007). In total, these probe sets allow AI to be assessed for 11,929 genes [79% of 15,107 genes in FlyBase R5.11 (August 2008)], with the majority of genes represented by multiple SNP probe sets. The SNP module is complemented by two additional modules: one that measures 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression and another that analyzes exon-level expression concurrently with allele specific expression (ASE). Experiments show an amount of sex bias (34% of 18,769 probe sets), alternative exon usage (164 genes), and AI (37% of 6579 probe sets within a species) consistent with previous reports on other platforms (McIntyre et al. 2006; Wayne et al. 2007; Telonis-Scott et al. 2008; Fontanillas et al. 2010).'","b'Multilevel analysis of transcription is facilitated by a new array design that includes modules for assessment of differential expression, isoform usage, and allelic imbalance in Drosophila.

The use of a single platform is cost effective, and statistical analysis is simplified by the single hybridization. We designed 60,118 D. simulans SNP probe sets from previously reported SNP variants (Benson et al. 2005; Begun et al. 2007). In total, these probe sets allow AI to be assessed for 11,929 genes [79% of 15,107 genes in FlyBase R5.11 (August 2008)], with the majority of genes represented by multiple SNP probe sets. The SNP module is complemented by two additional modules: one that measures 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression and another that analyzes exon-level expression concurrently with allele specific expression (ASE). Experiments show an amount of sex bias (34% of 18,769 probe sets), alternative exon usage (164 genes), and AI (37% of 6579 probe sets within a species) consistent with previous reports on other platforms (McIntyre et al. 2006; Wayne et al. 2007; Telonis-Scott et al. 2008; Fontanillas et al. 2010). The chip has 2,424,414 informative features, covering four types of probes: SNP probes (n = 1,442,832; 60,118 probe sets); 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression probes (n = 262,766; 18,769 probe sets); exon probes (n = 699,865; 61,919 probe sets); and control probes (16,943 GC band controls; 2008 hybridization and labeling controls; Figure 1). The 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression probes consist of all perfect-match (PM) probes from the Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0 array (900531, 900532, and 900533). The exon probe sets provide measurements of expression from each individual exon, allowing controls for signal fluctuation caused by 5\xe2\x80\xb2 bias in expression assays, as well as measurement of alternative exon usage. The exon probes consist of all Affymetrix Drosophila Tiling 2.0 Array (901021) probes that map uniquely to exonic regions (FlyBase R5.11 August 2008) at the time of chip design. Overlapping exons with alternative start/end sites in the same genomic region were combined into a single exonic region. The majority of exonic regions contain a single exon. (For simplicity, exonic regions are referred to simply as exons throughout this article.) Each exon corresponds to a unique probe set. The 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression probes and exon probes on this custom chip were designed by Affymetrix from D. melanogaster sequences. The probe sets have been used for other Drosophila species (i.e., Kopp et al. 2008; Graze et al. 2009; Dworkin and Jones 2009; Lu et al. 2010). Using these probe sets allows direct comparisons to existing literature and straightforward quality control. As each probe set has multiple probes, the impact of divergence is likely to be minimal on summary measures of expression. However, investigators comparing among species should consider filtering individual probes. The SNP module was designed for estimating AI. There were three main steps in this design: SNP identification, SNP quality assessment, and probe selection. Probe design. A total of 2,424,414 probes were printed on the chip. They are of four types: SNP probes (n = 1,442,832; 60,118 probe sets), 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression probes (n = 262,766; 18,769 probe sets), exon probes (n = 699,865; 61,919 probe sets), and control probes (not shown). The 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression probes consist of all perfect-match (PM) probes from the Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0 array. An example of a 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression probe set is shown in navy. The exon probes consist of all Affymetrix Drosophila Tiling 2.0 Array probes that map uniquely to exonic regions annotated in FlyBase R5.11 (August 2008). Exon probe sets within the example gene are shown in light blue. SNP probes are custom made. The SNP probes corresponding to a single SNP site base are shown in dark blue (matching the forward strand) and blue (matching the reverse strand). Alignment sets were created from multiple sequence sources, including FlyBase R5.4 exons (n = 68,536), six D. simulans strain genomes for Drosophila Population Genomics Project (DPGP, http://www.dpgp.org, Begun et al. 2007), and all D. simulans sequences (343,420) from GenBank (Benson et al. 2005) that were not annotated as \xe2\x80\x9cwhole genome.\xe2\x80\x9d In DPGP, D. simulans genomes, except for the heterochromatic regions, were assembled against the FlyBase R4.2 D. melanogaster genome. Exons from FlyBase R5.4 were BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990) aligned to the DPGP genomes and GenBank sequences. There were 325 exons with only GenBank sequence, 62,161 with only DPGP sequence, 3163 with both GenBank and DPGP sequence, and 2887 for which no sequence was available. For each FlyBase R5.4 exon, its genome location in D. melanogaster R4.2 genome was determined by BLAST exons that matched more than one location; those located on chromosomes four or U were excluded (n = 1912). All matching sequences for each exon were aligned using ClustalW (Thompson et al. 1994) to create a multiple sequence alignment at the exon\xe2\x80\x99s genome position. All SNPs, regardless of location in the exon, were identified from the multiple sequence alignment. A design window, which consisted of \xe2\x88\x9217 bases upstream and 17 bases downstream from each SNP (Figure 2) was the basis of SNP quality assessment. A SNP locus supported by fewer than five sequences was discarded. SNPs were also discarded when the design window mapped to multiple places in the genome or when more than one SNP occurred in the design window. These criteria identified 589,915 SNPs, of which 196,345 were biallelic. Only biallelic SNPs were considered further. There were 558 exons for which SNP data were identified from GenBank alone, 51,418 exons for which SNP data were identified from DPGP alone, and 2992 identified from both, resulting in a total of 54,968 exons with SNPs present; in other words, 81% coverage of the entire FlyBase R5.4 transcriptome (68,536 exons). SNP probe design windows. For each SNP site, there are four sets of probes, one for each SNP site base. The SNP base is designed at three different positions of the probes: middle, shifted four bases upstream, or shifted four bases downstream. Each SNP probe set contains 24 probes, which can be classified based on alleles as PM1 (n = 6), PM2 (n = 6), or MM (n = 12), for a total of 24 probes per probe set. A SNP probe set has a 35-base design window, with sequences of \xe2\x88\x9217 bases upstream and 17 bases downstream from the SNP. If there were fewer than five sequences supporting a SNP, the SNP was discarded. If more than one SNP occurred in the design window, then the alignment was considered suspect, and the SNP was not included among those printed on the array. Only biallelic SNPs that were unique in their design window and supported by five or greater sequences in the multiple alignment were considered. For each SNP, 24 probes were designed, with the SNP at the 0, +4, and \xe2\x88\x924 positions from the probe center, for the forward and reverse strands, and with each possible base (A, C, G, and T) at the SNP site. Probe hybridization quality was predicted by an Affymetrix internal scoring algorithm that takes into account Tm, secondary structure, and previous empirical observations. If a probe contained a homopolymer run or could not be synthesized or if one third or more probes had poor predicted hybridization, the probe set was eliminated. For genes with seven or fewer SNPs, all SNPs were selected. If a gene had more than seven SNPs, additional probe sets were selected at random (n = 610) to fill the chip. In sum, 60,118 custom SNP probe sets representing 11,929 genes (Figure 3) were included on the chip. The mean number of probe sets per gene was 4.4. The majority (8013 genes) had more than 3 probe sets. The chip library files are available at http://bioinformatics.ufl.edu/McIntyre_Lab/ASE. Probe sequences and chip annotation can be found at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) using accession ID GPL11273. Distribution of SNP probe sets per gene. A total of 60,118 probe sets, representing 11,929 genes, were selected for the SNP module for the custom chip. The number of genes (Y axis) with a given number of corresponding SNP probe sets (X axis) is shown. Most genes are represented on the array by one to five SNP probe sets. Two different isogenic strains of D. simulans, st\xc2\xa0e and C167.4, and their male and female progeny were used as the basis for the verification study. Three replicates of RNA from female and male progeny of the cross st\xc2\xa0e \xc3\x97 C167.4 were assayed for six RNA samples. In addition, DNA was used as a control for estimating AI (Wittkopp et al. 2004; Wittkopp et al. 2008; Degner et al. 2009; McManus et al. 2010). Three replicate gDNA samples were prepared for female st\xc2\xa0e, female C167.4, and the female F1 progeny of the cross st\xc2\xa0e \xc3\x97 C167.4, for nine gDNA samples. Flies were reared in incubators (25\xc2\xb0, 12:12 hr light/dark cycle) on a standard dextrose medium. Isogenic strains of D. simulans (C167.4, BDSC 4736; st\xc2\xa0e isogenic, DSSC 14021-0251.041 inbred >20 generations) were used. For each of three cross genotypes (C167.4, st\xc2\xa0e, and C167.4 \xc3\x97 st\xc2\xa0e), 20 virgin females were crossed to 5 males. Female and male progeny were collected on consecutive days (under CO2) and aged from 5 to 7.5 days in single sex vials. Flies were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen (without anesthesia) in a 2.5 hr window (4\xe2\x80\x936:30 pm). For RNA samples, two sets of 20 flies (subsamples) were collected for each replicate from multiple cross vials. No vials were used for more than one replicate. Flies were freeze dried at \xe2\x88\x9220\xc2\xb0 overnight prior to homogenization. Dried flies were ground to a fine powder using a GenoGrinder (maximum, 3 min, repeated twice). Trizol (1 ml) was added to each homogenized sample and mixed thoroughly in the GenoGrinder (maximum, 3 min). Samples were transferred to a new tube, 1 \xce\xbcl linear acrylamide was added to each, and then samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. RNA was extracted using a standard Trizol extraction protocol: phase separation using 0.1 vol BCP, RNA precipitation with isopropanol, 70% ethanol wash, and resuspension in 80 \xce\xbcl DEPC H2O. Concentration was measured using a NanoDrop, and up to 30 \xce\xbcg RNA per sample was treated with DNase I in 100 \xce\xbcl reaction volumes for 30 min at 37\xc2\xb0 (reaction mix: 4 U Cloned DNase I TaKaRa 2220A, 80 U Promega Recombinant RNasin N2515, in 1\xc3\x97 TaKaRa Cloned DNase I Buffer II). Samples were cleaned prior to concentration using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Cat. #74104) following the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s standard protocol with 30 \xce\xbcl DEPC H2O elutions (run through the column twice). RNA quality was examined using BioAnalyzer RNA 6000 Nano chips, and all samples were found to be of good quality. Genomic DNA was isolated from 35 to 40 flash frozen females using the AllPrep Mini Kit (Qiagen) following standard manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s protocols. Samples were concentrated by standard ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 31 \xce\xbcl DEPC H2O. Target materials were prepared for array hybridization using the recommended Affymetrix kits following the no amplification protocol of GeneChip\xc2\xa9 WT Double-Stranded Target Assay Manual (DNA samples started from Procedure D forward) for single Tiling Arrays. Briefly, 10 \xce\xbcg of total RNA was concentrated to 8 \xce\xbcl in DEPC H2O followed by first- and second-strand cDNA synthesis using the WT Double-Stranded DNA Synthesis Kit (P/N 900813). Per the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Manual (P/N 900371), 7.5 \xce\xbcg of dsDNA was fragmented. For each DNA sample, 7.5 \xce\xbcg of gDNA was fragmented to between 25 and 200 bp with 0.02 U/\xce\xbcg DNase I (Takara Cloned DNase I, 2 U/\xce\xbcl) in a 40 \xce\xbcl reaction with 4 \xce\xbcl reaction buffer (10\xc3\x97 reaction buffer: 100 mM Tris-acetate, 100 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM potassium acetate) and 0.8 \xce\xbcl BSA (10 mg/ml). Reactions were incubated 16 minutes at 37\xc2\xb0 and heat killed at 99\xc2\xb0 for 15 minutes. Fragment size was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragmented cDNA and gDNA targets were labeled using WT Double-Stranded DNA Terminal Labeling Kit (P/N 900812). The prepared target samples were hybridized using the Hybridization, Wash, and Stain Kit (P/N 900720) following the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s protocol (FS450_0001) for the Fluidics Station 450 with protocol. Arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix 7G scanner. The GEO accession for the array data is GSE31750. Signals were extracted from the scans using the apt-cel-extract program of the Affymetrix Power Tools (version 1.10.2) suite. GC bin control probes provide an estimate of nonspecific hybridization (Affymetrix 2005) and help to assess the overall quality of the hybridization. A GC bin control is a standard Affymetrix control based upon the number of G/C bases (from 3 to 24) in the 25 mer probe. None of the GC bin control probes align to the D. melanogaster or D. simulans reference genomes. Individual probes were classified according to their GC content and matched to the corresponding GC bin controls. A probe was considered detected when signal strength was higher than the median intensity of the corresponding GC band controls. Detection above background (DABG) was calculated at the individual probe level. The overall intensity of the array was evaluated at the individual probe level. To correct for the background noise and to normalize the probe signals, each probe was classified into a GC bin and the 5 percentile signal for that GC bin was subtracted from the probe signal. Yi, the signal for probe set i, is estimated as: . Xij is the intensity for probe j in probe set i and GCj is the average intensity for control probes in the corresponding GC bin. Ni is the number of probes in probe set i. Chip verification was analyzed first for the overall hybridization quality, then for each module on the chip (3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression module, exon module, and SNP module). The distribution of the overall signal across all modules was compared using kernel density estimates for each slide separately (Silverman 1986), with the goal of identifying any slide with an unusual distribution. Similar marginal distributions of kernel density would be expected for one sample type. Principle component analysis (PCA) (Johnson and Wichern 1992) was carried out to determine whether there was any pattern or grouping to the data. To verify the veracity of probe set estimates of 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression, we compared the signal from probe sets for the well-known sex-biased genes (Bownes 1994; Wolfner 1997): Yp (Yp1, Yp2, Yp3) and Acp (Acp29AB, Acp32CD, Acp36DE, Acp53C14a, Acp53C14b, Acp53C14c, Acp62F, Acp76A). Consistency of estimation of gene expression across modules was also examined using Bland-Altman plots (Bland and Altman 1986; Bland and Altman 1988; Dudoit et al. 2002; McIntyre et al. 2011), in which the exon module and SNP module were plotted against the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression module. The feature size of this array is smaller (5 micron) than is the Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0 array (11 micron). Although the PM probes are identical for these two chips, feature size may have an impact on differential expression (Dandy et al. 2007; Ammar et al. 2009). This raises the concern of potential loss of sensitivity. To evaluate the performance of the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression and exon modules, we compared expression for RNA samples between the two sexes of the F1 progeny. Sex-biased expression is well described for Drosophila (Bownes 1994; Jin et al. 2001; Parisi et al. 2003; Ranz et al. 2003; McIntyre et al. 2006; Telonis-Scott et al. 2008). The fixed effects model, (1)was fit for each probe set in the 3\xe2\x80\xb2expression and exon modules, where Yij is the signal for probe set i, sample j is as described above, \xce\xbc is the overall mean, si is the fixed effect of sex, and \xce\xb5ij is the random error. The null hypothesis that male and female sexes had equal expression levels was tested using an F-test (Neter et al. 1990). All probes in a given probe set were used. As only one genotype is considered, any polymorphisms between the genotype used and the probe will be the same between the two sexes of the same genotype. Results were corrected for multiple testing using False Discovery Rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995; Verhoeven et al. 2005). Where multiple probe sets matched the same genes, the agreement between the exon probe sets and the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression probe sets were examined for agreement in detecting sex bias using Kappa statistics (Fleiss 1981) and McNemar\xe2\x80\x99s test (Johnson and Wichern 1992). There is a sex bias in isoform usage in Drosophila (Kwan et al. 2008; Telonis-Scott et al. 2008; McIntyre et al. 2006). The use of alternative transcript isoforms between the two sexes can be detected from the measurements taken by the exon module. A probe set represents a constitutive exon for a gene (included in all annotated isoforms) or an alternative exon (included in a subset of known isoforms). Inferences can become ambiguous when probe set annotations correspond to exon regions located in overlapping regions of multiple gene models. Probe sets mapping to more than one gene or to the ambiguous regions of overlapping exons were excluded from analysis (n = 2611). The model (2)where x is the fixed effect of exon type and s is the fixed effect of sex was fit. Probe sets from multiple constitutive exons were grouped as one exon type, whereas probe sets representing alternative exons were each considered a different exon type. The variance was estimated separately for each sex. The significance of the interaction (a test for alternative isoform usage McIntyre et al. 2006) was tested using an F test, followed by FDR correction. By design, there are DPGP/GenBank sequences for all 60,118 probe sets in the SNP set, from which biallelic SNPs were defined and used for the chip design. SNP alleles were verified using Illumina genome resequencing data for the C167.4 and st\xc2\xa0e strains (GEO accession SRP005952) of D. simulans. D. simulans C167.4 sequence data were obtained from male head RNA libraries sequenced on multiple lanes with Illumina paired end procedures and chemistry (Celniker et al. 2009; McIntyre et al. 2011). D. simulans st\xc2\xa0e sequences were from genomic DNA extracted from adult st\xc2\xa0e D. simulans females. Average coverage was 30\xc3\x97. Reads were aligned to updated reference genomes (R. Graze et al., unpublished data) using Bowtie (Langmead et al. 2009) and LAST (Frith et al. 2010). Alignments were converted to pileup format using SAMtools (Li et al. 2009). SNP bases were identified from the pileup alignments and compared with alleles identified from DPGP/GenBank. The bases identified from C167.4 resequencing were also compared with the DPGP genome sequences for the C167.4 strain. To verify the chip\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to identify differences in AI, a subset of SNP probe sets unambiguous for the two alleles from the design and confirmed by the C167.4 resequencing and st\xc2\xa0e resequencing (where the F1 is heterozygous) were selected. The model, (3)was fit for probe sets in this subset using the nine F1 arrays (six RNA, three DNA). Yij is the normalized signal value for the ith sex, jth treatment, and the kth replicate. The treatment groups were defined by combinations of nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) and allele (PM1, PM2, and MM) for a total of j = 1\xe2\x80\xa66 levels and k = 1\xe2\x80\xa63 replicates. AI was examined by testing the difference in hybridization intensity between PM1 and PM2 in the RNA, compared with the difference in the DNA. An F test for this contrast was performed, and the result was corrected for multiple testing using FDR. The power of detection of AI effects may differ between the sexes due to sex bias in gene expression. There may also be sex-specific differences in AI. Both phenomena would result in a difference in detection of AI between the sexes. Unfortunately, the power for the test of an interaction was low. The AI was also analyzed considering the female and male data separately so that any differences between the sexes in the results might be apparent. Quality control evaluations showed that the three C167.4 parental DNA hybridizations had overall weaker signals and that the kernel density distribution was markedly different from all of the other chips. The DABG was only 70% for these hybridizations (Figure 4A) compared with \xe2\x88\xbc90% for other DNA samples. The remaining chips showed no obvious problems with hybridization. All modules (3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression, exon, and SNP) had similar proportions of probes detected above the median of the GC band control signals (Table 1). The proportions were \xe2\x88\xbc72% for RNA samples and \xe2\x88\xbc90% for DNA samples. The distribution of signal values across all modules was similar for all RNA hybridizations and differed from DNA hybridizations (Figure 4B). PCA identified no other hybridization anomalies. Both sexes had similar hybridization patterns (supporting information, Figure S1). The normalized signal intensities of the exon module probe sets and expression module probe sets for Acp and Yp genes gave the expected results (Figure 5). The average intensity for each gene was consistent between modules (Figure S2). Quality control analyses of the normalized data. (A) The proportion of probes detected above background (DABG) is reported for all probes sets of each sample: C167.4 parental DNA, st\xc2\xa0e parental DNA, and DNA and RNA of the F1 genotype. DNA samples are shown in dark gray. RNA samples are shown in light gray. The Y axis is the overall percentage of DABG. Probes were classified according to their GC content and matched to the GC band controls of the corresponding %GC bin. A probe was considered detected when signal strength was higher than the median intensity of the corresponding GC band controls. The three C167.4 parental DNA hybridizations had lower DABG compared with the other two genotypes of DNA samples. (B) Box plot for probe intensity classified by genotype and nucleic acid. DNA samples are shown in dark gray. RNA samples are shown in light gray. The Y axis is the normalized signal. Probes were classified according to their GC content and matched to the GC band controls of the corresponding %GC bin. The five percentile signal for that GC bin was subtracted from the probe for background correction. The corrected signals were then log-transformed. The three C167.4 parental DNA hybridizations had overall weaker signals. Expression for known sex-specific genes in female and male RNA samples. The Y axis is the normalized signal. A value around or lower than 3 is close to the background intensity and, therefore, should be considered as not detected. Female samples are shown in red. Male samples are shown in blue.

(D) The expression of an individual probe set that was designed for Yp genes. The directions of sex bias are as expected (Acps are male-specific genes, and Yps are female-specific genes). Individual probe sets for the same gene behave consistently. To test the smaller format features of the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression probe sets, we analyzed the effect of sex on expression level. Previous studies in Drosophila (Bownes 1994; Jin et al. 2001; Parisi et al. 2003; Ranz et al. 2003; McIntyre et al. 2006; Telonis-Scott et al. 2008) have all found sex bias in overall expression. Analysis of differential expression on the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression module revealed a strong effect of sex on gene expression. Three different significance levels (FDR < 0.05, FDR < 0.1, and FDR < 0.2) are reported (Table 2). Raw P values and adjusted FDR P values are in Table S1. Among all sex-biased probe sets at FDR < 0.1, 2216 had higher expression in males and 4140 had higher expression in females. Sex bias of expression was similarly analyzed for exon probe sets corresponding to single exons that exist in all transcripts of a gene (constitutive) (n = 47,122; Table 2; Table S3). The results for exon probe sets were compared with the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression probe sets corresponding to the same genes. There were 2091 genes with probe sets corresponding to exons contained in all transcripts, which could be easily matched to a single probe set in the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression module. The majority of genes showed similar sex bias between the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression and exon module, and simple agreement was high (1720, 82%). The Kappa statistic was 0.63 between the two modules, indicating good agreement. There was no apparent asymmetry in detection, with 106 genes detected by the exon module alone and 265 genes detected by the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 expression module alone. The McNemar\xe2\x80\x99s test statistics was 68.1429 with P value smaller than 0.0001. There were 164 genes that showed a significant interaction between exon type and sex; these were considered as showing putative isoform-specific sex bias (FDR < 0.1; Table S2). The D. simulans sequences used to design the SNP probes were sequenced as part of the DPGP. The sequencing strategy of DPGP was to sequence one line at \xe2\x88\xbc4\xc3\x97 coverage and six additional lines (including C167.4) at 1\xc3\x97. The confidence for SNP calls, therefore, varied depending on quality and depth. There were 60,118 probe sets, and of these, 42,978 had SNP base information for C167.4 from DPGP, 35,379 had additional data available from Illumina sequencing of C167.4 RNA, and 49,758 had additional data from Illumina sequencing of st\xc2\xa0e DNA. The concordance of C167.4 SNP base calls from the \xe2\x88\xbc1\xc3\x97 DPGP C167.4 strain genome sequence used for the chip design and the resequencing was 66.72%, significantly larger than expected by chance. This rate did not affect the quality of the SNP probe sets, as C167.4 was only one of the seven lines in DPGP that were used for our chip design. The concordance between the resequencing bases and the alleles used in the design was impressive. The C167.4 RNA-Seq base agreed with one of the two alleles identified in the design 99.58% of the time. Agreement between the st\xc2\xa0e DNA-Seq bases and the two alleles in the design was 99.75%. Next, the concordance between the resequencing and hybridization was examined by comparing resequencing SNP base calls to the probe bases ranked by the strength of their hybridization signals. The comparison was carried out separately for cases where the resequencing bases were the same for C167.4 and st\xc2\xa0e (homozygous F1) or where they were different (heterozygous F1). For n = 13,573 SNP probe sets homozygous at the SNP site in the C167.4/st\xc2\xa0e genotype, the ranked hybridization intensities of probes corresponding to each base (within a given SNP probe set) was compared with the predicted genotype at the SNP base (Table 3). A SNP probe set was included in this comparison when the common SNP allele call for C167.4 and st\xc2\xa0e strains corresponded to one of the alleles in the chip design, and the base was also the same in the DPGP sequence for the C167.4 strain. For example, if the SNP allele in both strains is A (with respect to the forward strand), probes corresponding to targets with A at the SNP position are expected to show increased hybridization intensity relative to the signal for the T, G, and C probes for all genotypes tested. The percentage of probe sets where the probes corresponding to the target SNP allele show the highest intensity is reported overall and separately for each base (Table 3). The concordance between the resequencing SNP and the C167.4 DNA arrays was significantly lower than other arrays, likely caused by the weaker signal intensity of the C167.4 DNA arrays. Similarly, the ranked hybridization intensities of probes corresponding to each base (within a given SNP probe set) was compared with the predicted genotype at the SNP base for n = 2769 SNP probe sets heterozygous at the SNP site in the C167.4/st\xc2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

xa0e genotype (Table S4). Our observed concordance is striking, given the small number of genotypes used in this experiment. A previous study (Borevitz et al. 2007) using arrays for detecting sequence polymorphisms reported a similar error rate. Larger experiments with more samples can reduce the error rate (Edenberg et al. 2005; Rabbee and Speed 2006). In comparison, a short-read sequencing experiment requires more than 200 reads unambiguously mapped to the gene for each gene to achieve a similar result (Fontanillas et al. 2010). The hybridization signals were compared with the two alleles (PM1 and PM2) used in the design. The concordances between the two highest ranked probe bases and the PM1 and PM2 bases were high: 96.22% for C167.4 DNA chips and 98.77% for st\xc2\xa0e DNA chips. For hybrid F1\xe2\x80\x99s, the concordance percentage was 98.62% for DNA chips and 97.53% for RNA chips. To determine whether the pattern of hybridization could be used to predict genotype, we performed a linear discriminate analysis (Johnson and Wichern 1992) for several arbitrarily selected probe sets heterozygous for the SNP base in the F1 hybrid. All that we examined showed visual separation of the expression patterns (Figure 6). These comparisons confirmed that the hybridizations performed as expected. Linear discriminant plots of three genotypes: AA, AC, and CC. Different genotypes had hybridization patterns that are visually separable by linear discriminant (LD) analysis. Each genotype is a different color. There were 33,914 unambiguous probe sets with sequence information for both the st\xc2\xa0e and C167.4 resequencing experiments at the SNP site. The SNP base was the same for the parental two lines for 74.78% of these probe sets, which were classified as homozygous for the F1 genotypes (n = 25,362). The rest of the probe sets (8552) had heterozygous F1 genotypes. The 6579 autosomal probe sets were analyzed for AI on the combined data from both sexes and for each sex separately (Table 4; Table S5). Our custom platform performs similarly to previous array platforms with a larger feature size (Jin et al. 2001; Ranz et al. 2003; McIntyre et al. 2006; Wayne et al. 2007). McIntyre et al. (2006) analyzed 10,014 transcripts in eight lines of D. melanogaster and identified 5221 sex-biased transcripts at FDR 0.05 (56% male bias and 44% female bias). The overall sex effect for eight genotypes was 53%. Similarly, on a study using nine D. melanogaster lines, Wayne et al. (2007) reported 7617 out of 9312 genes with sexually dimorphic expression (4070 male bias and 3547 female bias). These previous studies used multiple genotypes of D. melanogaster. When the data for Wayne et al. (2007) were reanalyzed for each genotype separately, the percentage of sex-biased genes ranged from 1.29 to 40.09%. For the genotype considered in this study, 31% of genes showed a significant sex effect, close to the upper end of the range. A slight excess of genes with increased expression in females was also observed in this analysis, as is seen in previous analyses (Ranz et al. 2003). These findings are consistent with findings from arrays with a larger feature size. Two previous studies using array designs (McIntyre et al. 2006; Telonis-Scott et al. 2008) found significant sex differences in alternative exon usage for many genes. For the single genotype examined here, approximately 5.6% of the genes examined showed evidence of sex-specific isoform expression. For four genes that are components of the sex determination pathway with previously reported sex-specific splicing in adults (tra2, Sxl, dsx, and fru), at least one exon shows evidence of sex bias. This is the first genome-wide study of allele-specific expression variation within D. simulans. Although only one genotype was used, significant differences in AI were detected for 37% of probe sets examined that contained heterozygous SNP loci. Other work using a priori selected genes found almost 67% of the genes tested showed evidence for AI within species (Wittkopp et al. 2008). This chip can be used to detect allele-specific variation in expression within species. Large differences between males and females were detected in the number of probe sets that showed significant differences in AI. It is currently unclear whether this result is explained by differences in AI between males and females or by sex bias in overall expression making power for detection uneven. As in microarray studies, to adequately assess ASE for a particular transcript using RNA-Seq, there must be adequate coverage for both alleles of that particular gene. For samples from the same organism and tissue, detection of transcription for a particular exon in four gigabases of RNA-Seq data are 57% (r. Graze et al., unpublished data), whereas detection is 72% for tiling arrays (Graze et al. 2009). Initial studies of AI examined how many informative reads were needed per gene for estimation of allelic frequencies (Fontanillas et al. 2010). This study suggests that average depth of coverage needed is quite large if most genes are to be evaluated. The actual coverage needed depends on specific assumptions and the number varies, but it is often in excess of 100\xc3\x97. Other examinations of RNA-Seq find that a minimum average depth of five reads per nucleotide are needed for estimation of expression (McIntyre et al. 2011). One lane of a GAIIX provides sufficient reads at a coverage of 5\xc3\x97 to assess \xe2\x88\xbc30% of the transcriptome (McIntyre et al. 2011). Arrays still provide a cost effective way of assessing transcription for the whole genome (Malone and Oliver 2011). Detailed studies within species that examine AI variation genome-wide and identify the impact of sex on this variation are needed to understand the true extent of cis regulatory variation within species in Drosophila. This array is a good tool for such studies because it will allow the overall and allele-specific components of expression variation to be examined in a single experiment on a single platform for many more genes than has previously been possible.

Bass']","November 4, 2011.",QTL Mapping and Candidate Gene Analysis of Telomere Length Control Factors in Maize (Zea mays L.),"b'Telomere length is a quantitative trait important for many cellular functions. Failure to regulate telomere length contributes to genomic instability, cellular senescence, cancer, and apoptosis in humans, but the functional significance of telomere regulation in plants is much less well understood. To gain a better understanding of telomere biology in plants, we used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify genetic elements that control telomere length variation in maize (Zea mays L.). For this purpose, we measured the median and mean telomere lengths from 178 recombinant inbred lines of the IBM mapping population and found multiple regions that collectively accounted for 33\xe2\x80\x9338% of the variation in telomere length. Two-way analysis of variance revealed interaction between the quantitative trait loci at genetic bin positions 2.09 and 5.04. Candidate genes within these and other significant QTL intervals, along with select genes known a priori to regulate telomere length, were tested for correlations between expression levels and telomere length in the IBM population and diverse inbred lines by quantitative real-time PCR. A slight but significant positive correlation between expression levels and telomere length was observed for many of the candidate genes, but Ibp2 was a notable exception, showing instead a negative correlation. A rad51-like protein (TEL-MD_5.04) was strongly supported as a candidate gene by several lines of evidence. Our results highlight the value of QTL mapping plus candidate gene expression analysis in a genetically diverse model system for telomere research.The ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes are called telomeres, a term coined by M\xc3\xbcller (1938). As early as 1919, chromosome ends were recognized as displaying unique behavior during the prophase of meiosis I (Digby 1919). Subsequently, telomeres were found to have distinct roles in stabilizing or capping the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes (McClintock 1941) and in solving the end-replication problem (Olovnikov 1971). More recently, research has revealed widespread conservation of telomere structures and functions across diverse species of plants, animals, protists, and fungi (Blackburn et al. 2006). Among the great biological discoveries in the twentieth century was the finding that telomerase regulation of telomere length plays an important role in cell aging and proliferative capacity in human cells (Bodnar et al. 1998). Given the variety of telomere functions, the catastrophic genomic effects and organismal consequences of telomere misregulation are not surprising. For example, many forms of cancer are associated with telomere defects, disruption of telomere-capping functions can be lethal (reviewed by Martinez and Blasco 2011), and telomere malfunctions in meiosis can lead to sterility or aneuploidy (McClintock 1941; Hackett et al. 2001; Riha et al. 2001; Bass et al. 2003). Telomeres are composed of short tandem repeats of DNA, typically in the range of 5\xe2\x80\x937 bp per repeat, associated with specialized protein complexes (Martinez and Blasco 2011). Telomere-repeat DNA, first identified in the protist Tetrahymena, was found to be a hexameric repeating sequence, CCCCAA/GGGGTT (Blackburn and Gall 1978). Since then, species-specific variations in the short repeat have been described (Henderson 1995). In addition, telomeres are polarized. The G-rich strand is longer than the C-rich strand in most species, resulting in a 3\xe2\x80\xb2 overhang (Henderson and Blackburn 1989). The telomere G-rich strand can also form G4-quadruplexes, short, four-stranded structural motifs in which four guanines lie in a planar arrangement, each hydrogen bonded to two neighbors (Marsh et al. 1995). G4-quadruplex elements are found at telomeres but also scattered throughout the genome. They can form in a variety of ways within or between strands of DNA or RNA and require disruption by helicases for efficient telomere DNA synthesis (reviewed by Lipps and Rhodes 2009). Another conserved telomeric structure is the T-loop, in which the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 overhang is inserted by means of strand displacement into the upstream double-stranded telomeric region. The resulting lariat-like T-loops can be visualized by electron microscopy in DNA preparations from animals and plants (Griffith et al. 1999; Cesare et al. 2003). T-loops are thought to stabilize the ends of the chromosomes and to prevent inappropriate DNA-repair activity (Smogorzewska et al. 2000). Telomeres also contain non-DNA components, including two relatively well-characterized multisubunit protein complexes, shelterin and the Cdc13/Stn1/Ten1 (CST) complex (reviewed by De Lange 2005; Giraud-Panis et al. 2010). The evolutionarily conserved shelterin complex facilitates T-loop formation and regulates telomerase action at the telomere. The complex is composed of six different proteins: TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, RAP1, TPP1, and POT1 (Liu et al. 2004; Ye et al. 2004, reviewed by De Lange 2005). Some of the components of shelterin have known homologs in plants, whereas others do not (Bunch et al. 2005; Shakirov et al. 2005). At least two families of plant-telomere double-strand DNA-binding proteins, RTBP1/TRFL and SMH, have been identified as having TRF-like single-myb DNA-binding domains (Yu et al. 2000; Marian et al. 2003). Some of these putative homologs of mammalian TRF proteins exhibit protein-protein interactions with other telomeric proteins (Kuchar and Fajkus 2004; Schrumpfova et al. 2008). The CST complex, found in animals, yeast, and plants, functions to maintain telomeric integrity, structure, and uniform length (Miyake et al. 2009; Surovtseva et al. 2009). One highly regarded model for telomere length regulation involves a negative-feedback or telomere protein-counting mechanism in which the length of the telomere and the abundance of the associated proteins produce a cis-acting negative feedback signal for telomerase-mediated extension (Marcand et al. 1997; Van Steensel and De Lange 1997). In addition, many components of the DNA damage machinery are essential for suppression of recombination and access of telomerase to the telomeres (reviewed by Lamarche et al. 2010). Other factors that influence the length and maintenance of telomeres include gene products associated with DNA replication, telomerase regulation, and telomere-repeat-containing RNA (reviewed by De Boeck et al. 2009; see also Riha et al. 2006; Feuerhahn et al. 2010). Most of what is known about plant telomere length control comes from genetic analyses in Arabidopsis that used knockout, knockdown, or overexpression of telomere-associated genes (for review see Watson and Riha 2010a), but the biological significance of naturally occurring telomere length variation in plants remains a mystery. The age-related telomere shortening observed in animals may not be a general feature of plants, as aging in plants is not directly comparable to aging in animals (for review, see Watson and Riha 2010b). Furthermore, the correlation between telomere length and age in plants seems to differ in different species. For example, barley telomeres shorten during embryonic and inflorescence development (Kilian et al. 1995), whereas Arabidopsis and Melandrium album telomeres showed little or no change during growth and development (Riha et al. 1998). In addition, long-lived pine trees have longer telomeres than some of their shorter-lived counterparts (Flanary and Kletetschka 2005), whereas Gingko trees exhibited slightly longer telomeres with increasing age and display seasonal fluctuations in telomere lengths (Liu et al. 2007; Song et al. 2010). These and other cases highlight the need for more information about the biological significance of heritable variation in telomere length. We therefore initiated a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping study to identify loci that contribute to telomere length variation in maize (Zea mays L.). In a previous QTL mapping study of telomere length control in maize, several QTL were found to account for a significant proportion of telomere-length variation (Burr et al. 1992). The mapping population was relatively small, however, and these QTL intervals have not been further characterized (Burr et al. 1992; Knapp et al. 1992). In humans, QTL linkage analysis of telomere length control led to the identification and analysis of several candidate genes, including the DDX11 helicase (Vasa-Nicotera et al. 2005), Rad51L, and FANCD2 (Andrew et al. 2006). A similar analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified two major loci with candidate genes necessary for telomere maintenance, as previously demonstrated by deletion analysis (Askree et al. 2004; Gatbonton et al. 2006). A well-developed and widely used mapping resource in maize is the recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of the maize IBM (intermated B73 \xc3\x97 Mo17) population. It is composed of 302 RILs with over 2000 mapped genetic marker loci (Lee et al. 2002; Sharopova et al. 2002). This population has been successfully used to map control loci for variation in cell-wall composition (Hazen et al. 2003), pest and fungal resistance (Nair et al. 2005; Balint-Kurti et al. 2007; Ordas et al. 2009), plant architecture (Lauter et al. 2008), tassel architecture (Pressoir et al. 2009), and seedling biomass (Zhang et al. 2010). Here we report our findings from QTL mapping of telomere length-control factors in the maize IBM population as well as results from quantitative real-time PCR expression assays performed on 16 candidate genes.'","b'Telomere length is a quantitative trait important for many cellular functions.

Telomere-repeat DNA, first identified in the protist Tetrahymena, was found to be a hexameric repeating sequence, CCCCAA/GGGGTT (Blackburn and Gall 1978). Since then, species-specific variations in the short repeat have been described (Henderson 1995). In addition, telomeres are polarized. The G-rich strand is longer than the C-rich strand in most species, resulting in a 3\xe2\x80\xb2 overhang (Henderson and Blackburn 1989). The telomere G-rich strand can also form G4-quadruplexes, short, four-stranded structural motifs in which four guanines lie in a planar arrangement, each hydrogen bonded to two neighbors (Marsh et al. 1995). G4-quadruplex elements are found at telomeres but also scattered throughout the genome. They can form in a variety of ways within or between strands of DNA or RNA and require disruption by helicases for efficient telomere DNA synthesis (reviewed by Lipps and Rhodes 2009). Another conserved telomeric structure is the T-loop, in which the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 overhang is inserted by means of strand displacement into the upstream double-stranded telomeric region. The resulting lariat-like T-loops can be visualized by electron microscopy in DNA preparations from animals and plants (Griffith et al. 1999; Cesare et al. 2003). T-loops are thought to stabilize the ends of the chromosomes and to prevent inappropriate DNA-repair activity (Smogorzewska et al. 2000). Telomeres also contain non-DNA components, including two relatively well-characterized multisubunit protein complexes, shelterin and the Cdc13/Stn1/Ten1 (CST) complex (reviewed by De Lange 2005; Giraud-Panis et al. 2010). The evolutionarily conserved shelterin complex facilitates T-loop formation and regulates telomerase action at the telomere. The complex is composed of six different proteins: TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, RAP1, TPP1, and POT1 (Liu et al. 2004; Ye et al. 2004, reviewed by De Lange 2005). Some of the components of shelterin have known homologs in plants, whereas others do not (Bunch et al. 2005; Shakirov et al. 2005). At least two families of plant-telomere double-strand DNA-binding proteins, RTBP1/TRFL and SMH, have been identified as having TRF-like single-myb DNA-binding domains (Yu et al. 2000; Marian et al. 2003). Some of these putative homologs of mammalian TRF proteins exhibit protein-protein interactions with other telomeric proteins (Kuchar and Fajkus 2004; Schrumpfova et al. 2008). The CST complex, found in animals, yeast, and plants, functions to maintain telomeric integrity, structure, and uniform length (Miyake et al. 2009; Surovtseva et al. 2009). One highly regarded model for telomere length regulation involves a negative-feedback or telomere protein-counting mechanism in which the length of the telomere and the abundance of the associated proteins produce a cis-acting negative feedback signal for telomerase-mediated extension (Marcand et al. 1997; Van Steensel and De Lange 1997). In addition, many components of the DNA damage machinery are essential for suppression of recombination and access of telomerase to the telomeres (reviewed by Lamarche et al. 2010). Other factors that influence the length and maintenance of telomeres include gene products associated with DNA replication, telomerase regulation, and telomere-repeat-containing RNA (reviewed by De Boeck et al. 2009; see also Riha et al. 2006; Feuerhahn et al. 2010). Most of what is known about plant telomere length control comes from genetic analyses in Arabidopsis that used knockout, knockdown, or overexpression of telomere-associated genes (for review see Watson and Riha 2010a), but the biological significance of naturally occurring telomere length variation in plants remains a mystery. The age-related telomere shortening observed in animals may not be a general feature of plants, as aging in plants is not directly comparable to aging in animals (for review, see Watson and Riha 2010b). Furthermore, the correlation between telomere length and age in plants seems to differ in different species. For example, barley telomeres shorten during embryonic and inflorescence development (Kilian et al. 1995), whereas Arabidopsis and Melandrium album telomeres showed little or no change during growth and development (Riha et al. 1998). In addition, long-lived pine trees have longer telomeres than some of their shorter-lived counterparts (Flanary and Kletetschka 2005), whereas Gingko trees exhibited slightly longer telomeres with increasing age and display seasonal fluctuations in telomere lengths (Liu et al. 2007; Song et al. 2010). These and other cases highlight the need for more information about the biological significance of heritable variation in telomere length. We therefore initiated a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping study to identify loci that contribute to telomere length variation in maize (Zea mays L.). In a previous QTL mapping study of telomere length control in maize, several QTL were found to account for a significant proportion of telomere-length variation (Burr et al. 1992). The mapping population was relatively small, however, and these QTL intervals have not been further characterized (Burr et al. 1992; Knapp et al. 1992). In humans, QTL linkage analysis of telomere length control led to the identification and analysis of several candidate genes, including the DDX11 helicase (Vasa-Nicotera et al. 2005), Rad51L, and FANCD2 (Andrew et al. 2006). A similar analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified two major loci with candidate genes necessary for telomere maintenance, as previously demonstrated by deletion analysis (Askree et al. 2004; Gatbonton et al. 2006). A well-developed and widely used mapping resource in maize is the recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of the maize IBM (intermated B73 \xc3\x97 Mo17) population. It is composed of 302 RILs with over 2000 mapped genetic marker loci (Lee et al. 2002; Sharopova et al. 2002). This population has been successfully used to map control loci for variation in cell-wall composition (Hazen et al. 2003), pest and fungal resistance (Nair et al. 2005; Balint-Kurti et al. 2007; Ordas et al. 2009), plant architecture (Lauter et al. 2008), tassel architecture (Pressoir et al. 2009), and seedling biomass (Zhang et al. 2010). Here we report our findings from QTL mapping of telomere length-control factors in the maize IBM population as well as results from quantitative real-time PCR expression assays performed on 16 candidate genes. Maize seed of the 302 F2 RILs of the IBM population were obtained from the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center (http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu/, Urbana, IL). The 302 maize diversity lines (Flint-Garcia et al. 2005) and the subset of 25 lines used as parents for the nested association mapping (NAM) population (McMullen et al. 2009) were obtained from the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station (orders 185771, 179535, USDA-ARS, Ames, IA). For DNA, 3- to 5-cm-long primary or secondary immature ear shoots, mature leaves, or emerged predehiscent tassels were harvested from plants grown in the greenhouse or field at the Mission Road Research Facility of the Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL. Seedlings for RNA were grown under fluorescent light banks indoors at 23\xc2\xb0 with 16 h light, 8 h dark, in superfine germinating mix (Fafard), and above-ground tissues were harvested at 2:00 pm, 2 weeks after planting. All plant material was quickly flash-frozen after harvest in liquid N2 and stored at \xe2\x80\x9380\xc2\xb0 until use. Plant tissues were ground frozen into a fine powder in liquid N2 with a mortar and pestle and kept at \xe2\x80\x9380\xc2\xb0 until addition of the first DNA-extraction buffer. Total DNA was extracted by one of the following three methods: a CTAB/phenol extraction method based on that of Saghai-Maroof et al. (1984), an aqueous DNA extraction method from Dellaporta (1994), and a Qiagen DNeasy Plant Maxi kit method (Qiagen, #68163). Integrity of total DNA was examined by inspection of ethidium bromide\xe2\x80\x93stained agarose gels after electrophoresis. Total DNA (4\xe2\x80\x9315 \xce\xbcg) was digested with 2.5 U/\xce\xbcg each of AluI, HaeIII, and MboI in 1\xc3\x97 Buffer 2 (New England Biolabs) at 37\xc2\xb0 for 18 h. For Southern blot analysis, digested DNA was separated on large 0.8% agarose gels by electrophoresis. DNA gel blots were performed essentially as by Southern (1975) onto Nytran-SPC (Whatman) nylon membranes and UV crosslinked (120 mj/sec, BioRad Stratalinker). DNA from a telomere PCR product generated by means of a template-free reaction (Ijdo et al. 1991) was used for the telomere probe. The telomere PCR product and lambda DNA probes were made separately by random-primed labeling with 32P-dCTP and combined for the hybridization. Southern hybridization was performed at 68\xc2\xb0 with previously described aqueous buffers (Bass et al. 1994), and the blots were exposed to a PhosphorScreen (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and imaged on a Typhoon Imaging System (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). PhosphorImages were analyzed with ImageQuantTL (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) with the \xce\xbb-HindIII molecular-weight marker to yield a standard curve. For median and mean telomere-length measurements, the radioactive signal intensity for each lane was divided by the molecular weight, and the resulting size-adjusted frequency distribution was subjected to statistical analysis with JMP 8 Statistical Software (SAS Institute). Composite interval mapping (CIM; Zeng 1993) of telomere length data was implemented in QTL Cartographer v1.17f (Basten et al. 2000). The genetic marker data set included 2019 markers (Sharopova et al. 2002; Lauter et al. 2008) for which quality-control tests of line identity had been performed (Lauter et al. 2008). On the basis of the quality-control data (not shown), 17 of the 195 phenotyped IBM RILs were omitted from our analysis. CIM estimations of QTL likelihoods and effects were performed at \xe2\x88\xbc8000 test positions at 1-centiMorgan (cM) intervals with five genetic markers as cofactors, which were selected by forward stepwise regression. A 10-cM blockout window on each side of the test position was imposed to allow local cofactor exclusion. To limit false discovery of QTL, we performed permutation tests to establish an \xce\xb1 = 0.01 comparisonwise threshold (CWT) for each test position (Doerge and Churchill 1996). For each of 1000 permutations of the phenotypic data, CIM was performed with the same parameters and steps, including cofactor selection as described by Lauter et al. (2008). For each trait at each test position, the 11th highest likelihood-ratio test-statistic value (LRTS) observed was used to set the CWT for that position. Only QTL deemed to be statistically significant by this method are reported. For each QTL, a support interval (SI) based on the \xe2\x80\x9c2-logarithm-of-odds drop\xe2\x80\x9d method is reported. These SIs approximate a 95% confidence interval for the positional localization of each QTL (Mangin et al. 1994; Crossett et al. 2010). The SIs were obtained from the map coordinates at which the LRTS had dropped 9.21 units from the QTL peak, which is equivalent to two logarithm-of-odds ratio units [logarithm of odds = LRTS/(2 \xc3\x97 ln10) = 4.605]. SI boundaries were also inferred if the LRTS dropped below 0.25 or if the end of a chromosome was reached. SI boundaries would have been inferred where a change in additive-effect direction occurred (supporting information, Figure S1), but no such changes occurred within the initial SIs recorded. To minimize CIM estimate\xe2\x80\x93based inflation of QTL effects (Zeng 1993; Beavis et al. 1994), we performed regressions with the genetic markers nearest to the detected QTL. Regression models were built by iterative testing of the fit of each marker. For median telomere length QTL (TEL-MD), the QTL bins (and their respective markers) were 2.09 (bnlg469b), 3.06 (AI714716), 4.01 (umc1682), 4.03 (npi386), 5.03 (umc1315), 5.04 (umc1966), 6.04 (umc65a), 7.04 (umc1708), 9.02 (umc1636), and 10.01 (AW330564). For mean telomere length QTL (TEL-MN), they were 1.01 (umc1906), 1.05 (umc1977), 2.09 (bnlg469b), 3.06 (AI714716), 4.01 (umc1682), 4.03 (npi386), 5.03 (umc2295), 6.05 (uaz121a), and 7.04 (AY110439). Within a bin, the two traits may differ in the marker selected to represent a QTL because the closest marker to the QTL peak was used. For example, bin 5.03 is represented by umc1315 for TEL-MD and by umc2295 for TEL-MN. Terms were only retained in the final regression model for a trait if they were significant at the \xce\xb1 = 0.05 level and their exclusion caused a drop in the adjusted R2 value for the model. Using only the markers judged significant by regression criteria, we performed pairwise tests for interaction using two-way analysis of variance. For both traits, 21 tests were performed among the seven significant markers that acted as surrogates for the QTL. To limit false discovery associated with multiple testing, we used Q-value (Storey 2002; Storey and Tibshirani 2003) to evaluate the significance of P-values among the 21 tests for each trait (false-discovery rate of 10%). An interaction effect is reported only if it met this criterion and could be added to the regression model under the criteria described above. Candidate genes were identified by inspection of the genome annotations and gene models from the reference genome of B73 (AGPv2 at http://maizesequence.org and http://maizegdb.org; Schnable et al. 2009), which is one of the two IBM parental inbred lines. Genomic regions primarily within and occasionally adjacent to the QTL peaks with relatively narrow support intervals were examined. Depending on interval size and gene density, different QTL peaks were typically associated with 3\xe2\x80\x9310 initial candidates, a list narrowed to a top-ranked choice for each locus by several criteria. The relative rankings of candidate genes were elevated if (1) they were already known to affect telomere metabolism or length in other species (e.g., see Askree et al. 2004; Gatbonton et al. 2006), (2) they encoded proteins with biochemically defined telomere DNA binding activity (e.g., see Dejardin and Kingston 2009), (3) they encoded proteins known to be involved in DNA repair or replication, or (4) they were associated with expression or regulation of telomerase. mRNA was purified from 16 genotypes with telomere lengths spanning the range of each population. For the IBM mapping population, these were Mo197 (2.4 kb), Mo362 (3.6 kb), Mo373 (3.7 kb), Mo283 (4.2 kb), Mo210 (7.3 kb), Mo248 (16.2 kb), Mo335 (16.5 kb), and Mo321 (22 kb). For the maize diversity lines, these were Mo18w (2.5 kb), Ki11 (2.6 kb), B73 (3.2 kb), NC358 (4.1 kb), Mo17 (8.8 kb), Oh43 (12.3 kb), IL14H (14 kb), and M37w (16 kb). RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA with SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Gene-specific primers (Table S3) were designed for each candidate gene based on the cDNA or gene model sequences from http://maizesequence.org. Most of the RT-PCR products, 50\xe2\x80\x93170 bp long, were designed to span an intron, providing an internal control for detection of contaminating genomic DNA. RT-PCR products were cloned and sequence-verified for each target gene. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on three biological replicates with an ABI 7500 Fast machine and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Melt curves were examined for problems associated with genomic DNA contamination, primer-dimers, or multiple products. Suitable targets were then used in a template dilution series to optimize for reaction efficiency. Cycle threshold values for each RIL were normalized to cytosolic Gapdh (GRMZM2G046804, http://maizesequence.org). Figure 1 shows the results of our TRF analysis examining telomere length variation as a function of maize development and genotype. The mean telomere length from RIL-Mo005 siblings was maintained in the leaf samples throughout the growing season and differed little from that of the immature ear shoot, an organ with multiple reproductive meristems (Figure 1A, lane 17). A comparison of the telomere lengths of B73 for vegetative (leaf) and male reproductive (emerged, predehiscent tassels) tissues also revealed little variation (Figure 1B). In addition, telomere length appeared stable within individual RILs (individuals from RIL Mo062, lanes 1\xe2\x80\x934, 6\xe2\x80\x939, Figure 1C) and across generations (compare G2 and G3, Figure 1C). TRF analysis of maize telomere length. Southern blots of various tissues and developmental stages were hybridized with a telomere-repeat probe. (A) Leaf DNA from four Mo005 siblings (plants A\xe2\x80\x93D) at weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9 after planting and 3\xe2\x80\x935 cm immature ear-shoot (ES) DNA (lane 17).

(D) A collection of maize inbred lines selected for their genetic diversity. The genotype is noted above each lane. M indicates the lanes with the molecular size marker, \xce\xbb-HindIII; sizes (kb) are indicated at the left side of each blot. The uniformity of telomere length in maize is remarkable, and the consistent length seen throughout the life cycle (Figure 1A) appears to contradict predictions based on the \xe2\x80\x9cend-replication problem\xe2\x80\x9d or the general animal model of age-associated telomere shortening. Telomeres may be shortening slightly with each cell division, but if so, the changes are too small to be detectable with this technique. The short life cycle and unique properties of plant meristems in relation to organ age and development may also contribute to the line-specific uniformity in telomere length. Plant meristems are present at all growing tips of the plant throughout the life cycle and resemble animal embryonic cells in that they are proliferative tissues known to express relatively high levels of telomerase (Fitzgerald et al. 1996; Kilian et al. 1998). Different leaves initiated from the meristem may have undergone a similar number of cell divisions since organ initiation, despite their difference in apparent age. This aspect of plant development confounds the concept of age as having a linear relationship with time (Figure 1A; for review see Watson and Riha 2010b). Our findings are also consistent with the idea that a genotype-specific telomere-length \xe2\x80\x9cset point\xe2\x80\x9d is established to provide uniformity from one generation to the next (Figure 1C; Schaetzlein et al. 2004; Shakirov and Shippen 2004). All of these factors, along with the comparatively short life cycle of annual plants such as maize, may contribute to the uniformity of telomere length we observed. In contrast to the high uniformity of telomere length within genotypes, variation among genotypes of maize is high (Burr et al. 1992). Large-scale analyses of diverse inbred maize lines has revealed a high degree of genotypic and phenotypic variation, allowing for the identification of a select subset of inbred lines of maize that capture much of the genetic variation found in the species (reviewed by Yu et al. 2008). For our study, we selected genotypes from among the 25 diverse lines that make up the parents of the NAM population (McMullen et al. 2009). From the TRF analysis of these diverse lines, we found more than 10-fold variation in telomere lengths, ranging from short (B73, 2.3 kb) to long (CML277, 19 kb), as shown in Figure 1D. We note that telomere length for a given line was also uniform when sampling tissues from different years, organs, or stock accessions, as summarized in Table 1. The variation we see in maize is remarkable in that it resembles the amount of variation normally associated with the entire plant kingdom (Kilian et al. 1995; Fajkus et al. 1995, 2002; Shakirov and Shippen 2004). This pattern of line-specific uniformity and population-wide natural variation makes maize telomere length an ideal trait for genetic analysis. Our QTL mapping study with the IBM population (Lee et al. 2002), integrated with the annotated B73 genome, permits fine mapping and rapid development of candidate genes for downstream analysis. The general telomere-length phenotyping strategy we employed is summarized in Figure 2. We chose immature ear shoot for the DNA source because it yields large amounts of high-quality DNA and exhibits telomere lengths similar to those of other tissues in a given genotype (see Figure 1A\xe2\x80\x93C; Table 1). Total maize DNA digested with a cocktail of restriction enzymes produces a pattern of restriction fragments mostly less than 500 bp long (Figure 2A). Telomere lengths vary greatly among RILs within the IBM population (Figure 2B), exhibiting transgressive segregation. For any particular RIL, the TRF signal on the blots (Figure 2B) represents a population of fragments that yield broad or smeared-looking bands in each lane. This band morphology is typical for TRF assays and results primarily from the inherent variation in telomere tract length found at the 40 different telomeres in diploid maize (2n = 2x = 20). Other contributing factors may include variation in subtelomeric DNA sequence where the restriction enzyme cuts and cell-type variation within the tissue. Despite this variation, each line produces a population of telomeres that is apparently maintained around a genotype-specific set point, which can be quantified and represented by a single value, such as the median or mean length. TRF analysis of the maize IBM population. Shown are representative ethidium-bromide\xe2\x80\x93stained agarose gel (A) and TRF blot (B) of the two parents and 24 recombinant inbred lines from the IBM population. TRFs were separated on an agarose gel, transferred to a membrane, incubated with a 32P-labeled telomere-repeat probe, and visualized by phosphorimaging. (C) Densitometry data were used to calculate median and mean telomere lengths (arrow). P1 is the maternal parent, B73. P2 is the paternal parent, Mo17. M indicates the molecular size marker, \xce\xbb-HindIII. Sizes (kb) are indicated at the left side of each blot. The asterisk indicates data omitted from the analysis. The procedure for measuring the average telomere length employed single-lane signal-intensity scans (Figure 2B, arrow) that were assigned a base-pair size by means of the \xce\xbb-HindIII standard curve and converted to signal-distribution histograms (Figure 2C, arrow). These were subjected to statistical analysis that yielded the median and mean telomere length. The resulting size-normalized median and mean telomere lengths (for 178 IBM RIL lines, listed in Table S1)reveal size variation ranging from 3.2 kb to more than 20 kb, a difference of nearly an order of magnitude. In addition, some signals (Figure 2B, asterisk) were detected near the top of the gel, at a position representing a size larger than that of the DNA fragments isolated. The positions of these signals were attributed to aberrant migration due to the formation of G4-quadruplex DNA structures formation. G4-quadruplex DNA is known to form in response to heating, the presence of potassium ions, high concentrations of DNA, and even repeated freezing and thawing of samples (Henderson et al. 1987; Marsh and Henderson 1994; Marsh et al. 1995; Penazova and Vorlickova 1997). We found that individual DNA preparations showing aberrant migration patterns were resistant to denaturation (data not shown), and such preparations were not used in the determination of line-specific telomere lengths. Size-normalized median and mean telomere lengths were both subjected to CIM with a high-resolution linkage map that is 7090 cM long and contains 2019 markers (Sharopova et al. 2002). QTL were robustly detected for both traits as shown in the QTL likelihood plots in Figure 3. The QTL that exceeded an \xce\xb1 = 0.01 comparisonwise significance threshold are reported in Table 2 and named according to the genetic linkage bin in which they reside (Davis et al. 1999). Ten median and nine mean QTL were detected; six loci (2.09, 3.06, 4.01, 4.03, 5.03, and 7.04) exceeded the significance threshold for both traits (Table 2). For the seven cases where the LRTS for only one trait exceeded the significance threshold, the LRTS for the other trait often exhibited a similar shape, suggestive of a weak effect rather than a functional difference. This pattern is most clearly seen for the QTL on chromosomes 6, 9, and 10 (Figure 3). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of median and mean telomere length. The X-axis represents centiMorgans (cM) along each chromosome, and the Y-axis represents the QTL likelihood. The bar at likelihood = 1 indicates the normalized threshold for significance of the median (black line) and mean (red line) telomere-length QTL. The chromosome number (Chr) and QTL names (TEL-MD and TEL-MN) are indicated for each plot. Marker regressions and conservative estimates of the median trait variance revealed that the QTL in bins 2.09, 3.06, 4.01, 5.04, 6.04, 9.02, and 10.01 accounted for 35.2% of the phenotypic variance. Similarly, analysis of mean trait variance revealed that the QTL in bins 1.01, 3.06, 4.01, 4.03, 5.03, 6.05, and 7.04 accounted for 33.1% of the phenotypic variance in telomere length. The partial R2 estimates for the individual QTL reflected the CIM results; no QTL effects explained more than 8% of the phenotypic variance. These regression analyses validated the CIM findings and provided the conservative estimates of aggregate QTL effects that explained about one third of the phenotypic variation for telomere length measurements. Two-way analysis of variance among seven significant (see Materials and Methods) QTL for each trait revealed a significant interaction among the median QTL (5.04 and 2.09). The statistical significance of the interaction was confirmed by addition of the appropriate interaction term to the TEL-MD regression model. When it was added, the model explained 38.0% of the variance for TEL-MD, and the interaction term accounted for as much variance as either of the two weakest effects, about 3%. One interpretation of this interaction is that B73 alleles at the 5.04 QTL act epistatically to reduce the effects of the 2.09 QTL (Table 2). The least-squares means for TEL-MD among lines with Mo17 alleles at 2.09 and 5.04 is \xe2\x88\xbc6600 bp. Adding B73 alleles only at 5.04 does not alter TEL-MD significantly. When B73 alleles are present at 2.09 but not at 5.04, TEL-MD is reduced to 4600 bp, but when they are present at both loci, TEL-MD is not significantly different from 6600 bp. Another interpretation of this interaction is that Mo17 alleles at 5.04 are required to potentiate reduction of telomere length by B73 alleles, which would be consistent with CIM results that revealed a negative effect of Mo17 alleles at 5.04 (Table 2). We note that B73 telomeres are among the shortest in maize. We therefore expected that, in the IBM population, alleles contributing to longer telomeres would be predominantly from Mo17. Surprisingly, this pattern was not generally observed. In fact, more than half of the QTL showed that the B73 allele promoted greater telomere length, but these loci have smaller effects on telomere length than the loci where Mo17 alleles were associated with longer telomeres (e.g. 2.09, 3.06, and 5.03). In addition, interaction effects such as the one described above can alter the relative strengths of genetic effects according to context. In this case, the strong negative impact of B73 alleles at 2.09 could be masked by the presence of the epistatic B73 alleles at 5.04. In comparing our results with those of the previous maize telomere length QTL-mapping study, we found two loci common to the two: 4.03 and 7.04 [ZP1F-UMC31A and BNL8.21-BNL8.39, respectively, from Knapp et al. (1992); based on telomere-length data from Burr et al. (1992))], but our analysis did not detect any of the three previously described loci with the strongest effects [linked to markers GLN1 on 10S, BNL8.23 on 4L, and YNH20 on 1L; (Burr et al. 1992)]. The most likely explanation for these differences is that we used different mapping populations. The eight candidate genes used for expression analysis are listed in Table 3. Because of the multiple QTL and relatively long list of candidates, we used expression analysis to screen them, on the assumption that some phenotypic variation might result from expression-level differences governed by cis-acting elements affecting the candidate gene. Because any such expression variation may be small, we used the sensitive and quantitative qRT-PCR assay. This approach has been useful in identifying genes that contribute to variation in quantitative traits (Brown et al. 2005; Norry et al. 2009). We also examined expression variation of eight additional genes known a priori to be telomere-regulating genes. mRNA was isolated from maize seedlings, and the relative transcript abundance for target genes was determined by qRT-PCR. We examined eight RILs and eight diverse maize lines whose telomere lengths showed high variation. The gene-expression levels and telomere lengths, analyzed by means of bivariate correlation analysis, are plotted in Figure 4 for each gene.

 deviations of the three biological replicates are reported in Table S2. For the IBM RILs (Figure 4A), the expression levels showed slight covariation with telomere length for some, but not all, candidate genes. The most common correlation was positive, and those that showed R2 values over 0.3 are putative Est1, Hsp70-like, RecQL, Smh6, and Rad51-like. Only one gene, Ibp2, showed a negative correlation. For the diverse lines (Figure 4B), even fewer correlations were observed. The two genes showing positive correlations in the diversity experiments were RecQL and Rad51-like, whereas none of the genes showed a significant negative correlation. qPCR analysis of candidate gene expression in eight long- or short-telomere lines from the IBM population (A) and the diverse maize lines (B). Gapdh-normalized inverse cycle-threshold (Ct) values (Y-axis) are plotted against telomere length in kilobases (X-axis). Slopes and R2 values are indicated. The full gene name is given in Table 3. The gene model IDs are given in Table S3. Although the slopes of the regression lines were small, all but one of the genes showing positive correlations have been previously established to be positive regulators of telomere length; the exception was Smh6, whose role in telomere length is unknown (Table 3, see references). Our results therefore suggest a possible role for the plant SMH (TRF-related) proteins as positive regulators of telomere length. Relatedly, mammalian TRF1 recruits POT1 to the telomeres, where it caps the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end (Loayza and De Lange 2003). In plants, Arabidopsis SMH telomere-binding proteins have been shown by means of yeast two-hybrid assays to associate with plant homologs of POT1 (Kuchar and Fajkus 2004; Schrumpfova et al. 2008). Furthermore, POT1 proteins from several plants bind single-stranded telomeric DNA in vitro (Shakirov et al. 2009, 2010), whereas other members of the plant POT1 family, notably AtPOT1, appear instead to interact with the telomerase RNA (Cifuentes-Rojas et al. 2011). These observations, taken together with our findings, support a role for SMH proteins as positive regulators of telomere length, possibly affecting telomeres through direct DNA binding, by interactions with plant POT proteins, or both. The negative correlation in the IBM lines of Ibp2 is consistent with the earlier demonstration that rice and tobacco members of this RTBP/TRFL gene family are negative regulators of telomere length (Yang et al. 2004; Moriguchi et al. 2006; Hong et al. 2007). To date, only the RTBP/TRFL and SMH families of proteins in plants are known to encode double-stranded telomere DNA-binding proteins. A recombinant C-terminal myb-containing portion of ZmIBP2 also binds to telomere repeat DNA in vitro (J. M. Moore and H. W. Bass, unpublished observations). These results suggest one possible model for telomere length regulation in plants in which SMH and RTBP/TRFL have opposing roles in controlling overall telomere length. Of all the candidate genes examined, the Rad51-like gene (TEL-MD_5.04) stands out in several respects. First, its QTL showed an epistatic interaction with another locus (TEL-MD_2.09), which maps to the same interval as a candidate gene with similarity to replication factor C (putative RFC). Both candidates belong to gene families associated with DNA metabolism, and a genetic interaction seems plausible. Second, the Rad51-like candidate gene showed the strongest correlation in the expression analysis in both the IBM RILs (Figure 4A) and the diverse lines (Figure 4B). Third, RAD51L was a candidate gene suggested by a human telomere-length QTL study (Andrew et al. 2006). Fourth, EST sequence analysis shows this gene (NCBI UniGene Zm.24480) to be expressed at 6,21, and 201 transcripts/million in shoot, meristem, and embryo, all tissues where telomere set points or length maintenance is expected to be important. Finally, a role for RAD51-like proteins has been established for homologous recombination-based telomere maintenance (Tarsounas et al. 2004; Oganesian and Karlseder 2011). This class of proteins could potentially influence telomere length through its roles in multiple recombination-based pathways, which are known to play roles in telomerase regulation (Lamarche et al. 2010). Taken together, this information points to the Rad51-like gene TEL-MD_5.04 as a promising candidate for additional examination. Interestingly, the diverse lines of maize show even less expression variation than the IBM RILs in our qPCR profiling experiments, even though they represent a sampling of up to eight alleles per locus. Several explanations are possible; for example, the diversity lines examined may have spanned less phenotypic space (2.5\xe2\x80\x9316 kb) than the IBM RILs (2.4\xe2\x80\x9322 kb). In this case, the inclusion of lines with larger TRFs may increase our ability to detect correlations. In addition, a lack of correlation in mRNA abundance and telomere length in both the IBM and diversity-line experiments could have several explanations: variation in protein sequence or activity that is not associated with transcript abundance, linkage of a candidate that is not the causal gene for the QTL, or relatively low variation of maize telomere-regulating genes. Indeed, genome-wide association studies in humans found that 37 telomere-maintenance genes analyzed show limited genetic variation, high ancestral allele frequencies, and low population differentiation (Mirabello et al. 2010). These results suggest that human telomere-maintenance genes are under selective pressure against extensive evolutionary divergence. The remarkably high natural genetic variation in maize should be ideally suited for mapping low-variance telomere-maintenance genes in mapping populations such as the recently developed NAM population (Gore et al. 2009; McMullen et al. 2009). The study reported here revealed several regions of the maize genome that harbor allelic variation associated with telomere-length regulation. Subsequent screening by expression analysis helped identify specific genes for further study. Overall, we find that quantitative genetic analysis of naturally occurring telomere-length variation in maize has excellent potential to shed light on telomere-length control in plants, an important phenomenon from both evolutionary and agronomic perspectives.

Crockett', 'Talia Muram', 'Kalyan Mallempati', 'Hunter Best', 'Rong Mao']","November 4, 2011.",The SPRED1 Variants Repository for Legius Syndrome,"b'Legius syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline loss-of-function mutations in the sprouty-related, EVH1 domain containing 1 (SPRED1) gene. The phenotype of LS is multiple caf\xc3\xa9 au lait macules (CALM) with other commonly reported manifestations, including intertriginous freckling, lipomas, macrocephaly, and learning disabilities including ADHD and developmental delays. Since the earliest signs of LS and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome are pigmentary findings, the two are indistinguishable and individuals with LS may meet the National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria for NF1 syndrome. However, individuals are not known to have an increased risk for developing tumors (compared with NF1 patients). It is therefore important to fully characterize the phenotype differences between NF1 and LS because the prognoses of these two disorders differ greatly. We have developed a mutation database that characterizes the known variants in the SPRED1 gene in an effort to facilitate this process for testing and interpreting results. This database is free to the public and will be updated quarterly.Legius syndrome (LS; MIM #611431) is an inherited disease caused by autosomal dominant loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the sprouty-related, EVH1 domain containing 1 (SPRED1) gene (MIM #609291) (Brems et al. 2007). LS, also known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-like syndrome, is a disorder with a pigmentary phenotype overlapping with NF1 syndrome. Individuals with LS may meet the diagnostic criteria set by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for NF1 syndrome (Brems, et al., 2007; Pasmant, et al., 2009; Stevenson, et al. 2010), except people with LS have not been shown to develop tumors as found in NF1(Muram-Zborovski et al. 2010). Additional manifestations associated with LS have also been reported in individuals with NF1 (i.e., macrocephaly, lipomas, learning difficulties, Noonan syndrome-like facial features, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and pectus excavatum (Brems et al. 2007; Friedman 1998; Muram-Zborovski et al. 2010; Pasmant et al. 2009). For a clinical diagnosis of NF1, an individual must meet two or more of the following criteria: six or more caf\xc3\xa9-au-lait macules (CALM); two or more neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma; freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions; optic glioma; two or more Lisch nodules; distinctive osseous lesion; and/or a first-degree relative with the diagnosis of NF1. LS patients may meet the NIH diagnostic criteria for NF1 based on pigmentary findings of caf\xc3\xa9-au-lait macules and distinctive freckling pattern alone. It is therefore important to fully characterize the phenotype differences between LS and NF1 because the prognoses for these two disorders differ significantly. This is especially true in children, as definitive features of NF1 are acquired with age, and the only manifestation may be CALM and axillary/inguinal freckling, making it difficult to differentiate between LS and NF1 without genetic testing. The SPRED1 gene, located on chromosomal region 15q3.2, contains seven coding exons and produces a protein that is a negative regulator of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. It is believed that SPRED1 interacts directly with RAS-RAF signaling and that most germline mutations in the SPRED1 gene result in a truncated protein that is incapable of properly interacting with the RAS pathway. However, pathogenic missense mutations, as well as large deletions encompassing part of or the entire SPRED1 gene, have been described, suggesting that many different types of mutations are capable of resulting in protein products unable to properly regulate the RAS-MAPK pathway. These mutations can produce a LS phenotype and may complicate the interpretation of genetic testing results. As such, clinical and research laboratories that offer SPRED1 gene analysis often encounter rare variations and must rely on the published literature or online resources to determine the clinical relevance of the identified variant. We have developed a database devoted to LS-related mutations in the SPRED1 gene to facilitate this process. We have recently reported gene variant archives for galactosemia (GALT), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (RET), juvenile polyposis syndrome (SMAD4), and X-linked Alport syndrome (COL4A5). These clinically curated archives uniquely display genotype and associated phenotype information. Here, we introduce a new disease database for LS syndrome and SPRED1 gene variants. This database was developed to serve as a reference for all sequence variations currently reported in the SPRED1 gene as well as to provide as much phenotype information as possible (Calderon et al. 2007; Crockett et al. 2010; Margraf et al. 2009; Wooderchak et al. 2010). To date, 78 variants have been described in the SPRED1 gene, of which 49 have been classified as disease causing or pathogenic, 1 as suspected pathogenic, 7 as suspected benign, 8 as benign polymorphisms, and 13 with uncertain significance (Brems et al. 2007; Denayer et al. 2011; Messiaen et al. 2009; Muram-Zborovski et al. 2010; Pasmant et al. 2009; Spencer et al. 2011; Spurlock et al. 2009).'","b'Legius syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline loss-of-function mutations in the sprouty-related, EVH1 domain containing 1 (SPRED1) gene.

The aim of the SPRED1 variant database is to record all known variants in the SPRED1 gene and their associated phenotype. This database is freely available to the public, and users are encouraged to submit newly discovered variants to the database curator using the \xe2\x80\x9cDatabase Submission\xe2\x80\x9d webpage. This form also can be used to update clinical information or to clarify the classification or phenotype for existing sequence variants. The submission form requests information on the sequence variation, clinical consequences, publications, and the submitter\xe2\x80\x99s contact information. Those submitting new variants to the database are expected to follow their own Institutional Review Board protocols or consenting processes, as their host institutions deem necessary. To maintain the accuracy and utility of the SPRED1 database, content will be updated quarterly using new sequence variation information from literature reports, database submissions and updates, and routine clinical testing performed at ARUP Laboratories. The original start date and date of the latest update is displayed on the SPRED1 \xe2\x80\x9cHome\xe2\x80\x9d webpage. The SPRED1 database was constructed using gene sequence variation data published in the scientific literature since the SPRED1 gene was first identified in patients with a NF1-like phenotype but with no identifiable NF1 gene mutation in 2007 (Brems et al. 2007). To date, 78 sequence variants have been found by searching PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez) and Google (http://google.com/). Search terms included SPRED1, Legius syndrome, and NF1-like syndrome. Occasionally, laboratory-sequencing results that identify novel gene variants are also included in this archive. The database was constructed using the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) and Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Mutation Database Initiative recommendations for essential and optional content (http://www.hgvs.org/mdifaq.html). HGVS nomenclature recommendations for description of sequence variants were used to generate DNA and protein changes for this database. Reference sequences for this database were GenBank NC_000015.9, NM_1525940.2, and NP_689807.1; entries were verified for position and name based on these sequences. All sequence variants in the database (including future updates) are named based on their position in relation to the coding regions of the SPRED1 gene (cDNA) following recommendations listed by the HGVS (http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen) and described in Den Dunnen and Antonarakis (2000). To comply with sequence variant nomenclature according to the guidelines of the Human Genome Variation Society, the online batch position check tool Mutalyzer 2.0 (http://www.mutalyzer.nl/) was used to confirm genomic position of all SPRED1 gene variants (Wildeman et al. 2008). SQL tables (MySQL, Inc.) were organized to represent SPRED1 mutation status, associated phenotype, literature references, and any known clinical information. PHP coding was performed in-house for dynamic HTML display to render pages and display SQL tables. Graphics were generated using FusionCharts v3 (www.fusioncharts.com). Web pages are hosted on a Mac OS X Apache server. SPRED1 mutations were added to the database and edited using phpmyadmin (www.phpmyadmin.net). The SPRED1 database can be found under Disease Databases on the ARUP Online Scientific Resource webpage http://www.arup.utah.edu/ or accessed directly by using the URL http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/SPRED1/SPRED1_welcome.php. Navigation between the series of webpages can be done using the quick links as shown in Figure 1A. The SPRED1 \xe2\x80\x9cHome\xe2\x80\x9d webpage briefly describes Legius syndrome, phenotype, the database goals, reference sequences used, and gene sequencing tests available at ARUP Laboratories. The right frame of the page conveniently lists contact information for the appropriate experts involved in the database development and curation, including medical director, submissions, testing, and website administrator. The \xe2\x80\x9cHome\xe2\x80\x9d page also provides a graphic link to the SPRED1 gene topic hosted by the National Library of Medicine\xe2\x80\x99s Genetics Home Reference (http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SPRED1). Legius syndrome database display. (A) Quick links for navigation within the website for SPRED1 homepage, database display, links, and submission. (B) Main database display including a \xe2\x80\x9clive search\xe2\x80\x9d function for easy filtering to gene variants of interest. (C) Clicking any display column heading will sort gene variants in ascending or descending order. (D) Mouse-over function for additional clinical \xe2\x80\x9cComments\xe2\x80\x9d column follows the literature reference column. The SPRED1 \xe2\x80\x9cLinks\xe2\x80\x9d webpage has hyperlinks to existing online resources for Legius syndrome and SPRED1, including Databases, Gene and Protein Links, Web Reviews, and Literature Reviews. Some of the resources listed here include Gene Reviews, Genetics Home Reference, OMIM, UniProt, Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), and the SPRED1 reference sequences used for our database curation. Lastly, recent literature reviews from experts in this disease area are posted and updated as appropriate. The SPRED1 database can be displayed and searched in its entirety by accessing the \xe2\x80\x9cDatabase\xe2\x80\x9d webpage shown in Figure 1B. The database contained 78 entries as of May 2011. The default database display is by genomic position of each sequence variant (5\xe2\x80\xb2 to 3\xe2\x80\xb2) within the SPRED1 gene. Figure 1C shows the database display columns of Location, Mutation Type, Nucleotide Change, Protein Change, Classification, Meets NIH NF1 Criteria, References, and Comments. Information in the Comments column (Figure 1D) is available by placing the pointer over the comments icon. This information may further explain the data displayed for each entry. The database also has \xe2\x80\x9clive search\xe2\x80\x9d functionality, so that any term entered in the search box (e.g., exon, insertion, benign, or author name), will dynamically filter the displayed listing. Finally, clicking any column heading will sort (ascending and descending) the gene variant entries for redisplay. The \xe2\x80\x9cSubmissions\xe2\x80\x9d webpage is used for submission of novel SPRED1 sequence variants to the database or to update information for sequence variations currently archived in the database. Contact information is conveniently seen on the \xe2\x80\x9cHome\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLinks\xe2\x80\x9d pages. Requested information during submission includes gene variant location, mutation type, classification, nucleotide change, protein change, clinical significance, and contact information of the submitter. All submissions are received via autogenerated e-mail to the curators, and variant updates are added to the database quarterly. The Location column displays the exon or intron number for each SPRED1 gene variant. Mutation Type describes the biological event leading to the change in the DNA (relative to the reference sequence). Common types of variants include small deletions and insertions/duplications, missense, nonsense, splice-site, silent, and recently, large deletions (those equal to or larger than a single exon) that have been reported (Spencer et al. 2011). Large duplications have not been reported in individuals with Legius syndrome. SPRED1 gene variant mutation types are graphically summarized in Figure 2. Dynamic graphical summary of (A) variant classification and (B) types of mutations found in the SPRED1 database. The Nucleotide Change column displays the corresponding HGVS nomenclature (Den Dunnen and Antonarakis 2000). For cDNA numbering in the Nucleotide Change column of the SPRED1 database, the first cDNA nucleotide (c.1) is the \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d of the ATG initiation (start) codon. For the Protein Change column, the single amino acid changes are listed in the database display. Where splice-site variants occur, only the genotype is listed, with the protein change indicated with a question mark. In the Classification column, definitions for pathogenicity are Pathogenic, Suspected Pathogenic, Benign, Suspected Benign, or Uncertain. As is common practice, loss of function (LOF) mutations are assumed pathogenic, and the author\xe2\x80\x99s classification for each variant was used. The phenotype associated with each variant is listed by author if the variant was reported more than once. The final two columns of the database feature links to literature resources and genotype/phenotype findings of each individual variant. As displayed in Figure 1D, moving the cursor over the comments icon highlights a key feature and unique part of this online resource. Comments for each SPRED1 variant often contain additional information or evidence to support the classification designation and whether the patient meets NIH diagnostic criteria for a clinical diagnosis of NF1. Importantly, clinical details, such as age or other conditions, may be included. Sensitive and private patient information is never listed. Currently, the database displays information and classification of 78 SPRED1 gene variants. However, this number is actively increasing as additional variants are described in the scientific literature and discovered in routine clinical testing and research laboratories. Pathogenic mutations detected during routine clinical testing of patient samples at ARUP Laboratories or those submitted by other laboratories will also be added to the database. As mentioned above, for variants included from the scientific literature, the database provides a linked reference to the PubMed abstract for each variant. Because the classification of each variant is directly based on evidence from the scientific literature, the link to PubMed is a very useful feature of this database. However, in cases where a variant has not yet been reported in the literature, the database provides the clinical and/or experimental, functional data suggestive of its classification. Laboratories and database users may also contact curators via e-mail or phone regarding database entries, additional references, or clarification of information posted on the site at any time. Figure 2 summarizes the content of the SPRED1 database by variant classification and mutation types. Analysis of the different types of mutations currently contained in the database are provided, including deletion (16), large deletion (3), insertion/deletion (1), duplication (6), insertion (4), missense (23), nonsense (16), silent (4), intronic (4) and splice site effect (1). Clinical and research laboratories that offer full gene analysis often encounter rare variants and must rely on the published literature or online resources to make informed decisions about the classification of the variant when reporting their findings. We developed this database to facilitate this decision-making process and assist those who interpret results and care for patients. A key feature of this database is the ease of access with which it provides pertinent gene variant information and the associated genotype-phenotype observations. In addition, the database is curated by individuals with expertise in molecular genetics and Legius syndrome, ensuring that all of the information contained in the archive is up to date and of sufficient scientific rigor. Finally, as this database is a publicly available resource, with no login or membership requirement, it serves as an ideal centralized resource to all laboratories offering SPRED1 gene analysis, as well as to genetic counselors or physicians treating patients.

6,"['Bryan Howie', 'Jonathan Marchini', 'Matthew Stephens']","November 4, 2011.",Genotype Imputation with Thousands of Genomes,"b'Genotype imputation is a statistical technique that is often used to increase the power and resolution of genetic association studies. Imputation methods work by using haplotype patterns in a reference panel to predict unobserved genotypes in a study dataset, and a number of approaches have been proposed for choosing subsets of reference haplotypes that will maximize accuracy in a given study population. These panel selection strategies become harder to apply and interpret as sequencing efforts like the 1000 Genomes Project produce larger and more diverse reference sets, which led us to develop an alternative framework. Our approach is built around a new approximation that uses local sequence similarity to choose a custom reference panel for each study haplotype in each region of the genome. This approximation makes it computationally efficient to use all available reference haplotypes, which allows us to bypass the panel selection step and to improve accuracy at low-frequency variants by capturing unexpected allele sharing among populations. Using data from HapMap 3, we show that our framework produces accurate results in a wide range of human populations. We also use data from the Malaria Genetic Epidemiology Network (MalariaGEN) to provide recommendations for imputation-based studies in Africa. We demonstrate that our approximation improves efficiency in large, sequence-based reference panels, and we discuss general computational strategies for modern reference datasets. Genome-wide association studies will soon be able to harness the power of thousands of reference genomes, and our work provides a practical way for investigators to use this rich information. New methodology from this study is implemented in the IMPUTE2 software package.Genotype imputation is a well-established statistical technique for estimating unobserved genotypes in association studies (Browning 2008; Li et al. 2009; Marchini and Howie 2010). Imputation works by copying haplotype segments from a densely genotyped reference panel into individuals typed at a subset of the reference variants. In this way, genotypes can be estimated and tested for association at variants that were not assayed in a study. This approach can increase the power of a given study (Guan and Stephens 2008; Li et al. 2010; Marchini et al. 2007; Servin and Stephens 2007), find candidate susceptibility variants to guide fine-mapping (e.g. Liu et al. 2010), and facilitate meta-analyses that combine studies genotyped on different sets of variants (De Bakker et al. 2008; Zeggini and Ioannidis 2009). Although the statistical methods for genotype imputation are now highly developed and widely used, there are still open questions in the field. Of these, one of the most pressing is how best to use rapidly accumulating reference datasets from around the world to impute into various human populations. Our goal in this paper is to develop a framework for achieving accurate and efficient imputation with current and future reference panels. We focus specifically on low-frequency variation (defined here as polymorphisms with MAFs from 0.5 to 5%) because interrogating such variants is a major aim of contemporary association studies (McCarthy et al. 2008; Stranger et al. 2011). In the first generation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), most imputation analyses used reference panels from Phase 2 of the International HapMap Project (The International HapMap Consortium 2005), which contain a total of 210 unrelated individuals with ancestry from West Africa, East Asia, and Europe. More recently, Phase 3 of the HapMap Project (The International HapMap Consortium 2010) increased the public reference set to over 1000 unrelated individuals sampled from 11 locations, including parts of the world that were poorly represented by HapMap 2. The 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2010) is currently extending this resource by applying whole-genome shotgun sequencing to an even larger number of individuals (\xe2\x88\xbc2500) sampled from a finer geographic grid (\xe2\x88\xbc25 separate locations). Direct sequencing can identify variants not represented on the genotyping arrays that were used in the HapMap Project, so this reference set will include many more polymorphic sites than did previous imputation reference panels, with most of the new variants occurring at low population frequencies. As high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies continue to mature and decrease in cost, the worldwide collection of reference data will continue to grow. There are numerous approaches for building imputation reference panels from publicly available resources. Many published GWAS simply used the HapMap 2 panel that most closely matched the ancestry of the study population; e.g. CEU for European populations and CHB+JPT for East Asian populations. This \xe2\x80\x9cbest match\xe2\x80\x9d strategy produced useful results in several studies, but it can yield suboptimal accuracy with more diverse reference collections (The International HapMap Consortium 2010) or in studies with no clear reference matches (Huang et al. 2009a). A simple alternative is to use a \xe2\x80\x9ccosmopolitan\xe2\x80\x9d reference set that includes all available haplotypes, each of which is assigned an equal chance of being copied a priori. This approach produces relatively accurate results in a variety of human populations and has therefore been proposed as a good fallback choice when the optimal panel composition is unclear (Guan and Stephens 2008; Huang et al. 2009a; Li et al. 2010). Another class of methods tries to maximize accuracy by weighting reference panels through cross-validation (Huang et al. 2009a) or ancestry estimation (Egyud et al. 2009; Pasaniuc et al. 2010); the Pasaniuc et al. approach differs from the others in that it uses local ancestry estimates to provide customized reference weights for each study individual. As an alternative, Jostins et al. (2011) suggested balancing accuracy and computation by using reference panels that \xe2\x80\x9capproximately cluster\xe2\x80\x9d with the study individuals on a plot of principal components (PC) that capture genetic ancestry. The standard way to impute genotypes in a GWAS is to apply one of these panel selection schemes and then pass the indicated haplotypes to an imputation method. Modern reference datasets pose a couple of challenges to this paradigm. First, many panel selection strategies become harder to execute or interpret as reference data are sampled from more populations. For example, the systematic HapMap 2 cross-validations from Huang et al. (2009a) would be more difficult to implement with additional panels, and it is harder to make clear demarcations on a plot of PCs [as recommended by Jostins et al. (2011)] as more populations are included. More importantly, larger reference panels increase the computational burden of imputation, which may compel some investigators to use smaller panels at the cost of imputation accuracy and association power. Methodological developments like \xe2\x80\x9cpre-phasing\xe2\x80\x9d (which we address in the Discussion) can alleviate this concern by speeding up imputation, but existing methods still need substantial computing power to handle reference sets with thousands of haplotypes. Our work was motivated by the idea that growing reference datasets need not make panel selection more difficult or force tradeoffs between imputation speed and accuracy; in principle, larger and more diverse reference collections could actually make it easier to identify haplotype sharing with simple models, thereby making imputation faster and more accurate. Kong et al. (2008) demonstrated this point in a large sample from a founder population, where they found that genotypes could be accurately phased and imputed using simple identity-by-state (IBS) calculations to identify shared haplotype segments. Howie et al. (2009) introduced a related idea for phasing smaller samples from outbred populations, and we wanted to see whether a similar approach could help impute genotypes from modern reference panels. On the basis of our findings, we propose an imputation framework with two basic components: (i) a cosmopolitan reference panel and (ii) a new algorithmic approximation that maintains the accuracy of large, diverse panels while controlling computational costs. We use a cosmopolitan panel for its combination of simplicity and accuracy: past studies have shown that such panels produce similar accuracy to those chosen by more sophisticated schemes (Guan and Stephens 2008; Huang et al. 2009a; Li et al. 2010) and that they can improve accuracy at low-frequency variants (Jostins et al. 2011; Marchini and Howie 2010). Our approximation is based on the idea that, within a limited genomic region, allelic consistency between study and reference individuals can be used to quickly rule out unhelpful reference haplotypes, thereby making imputation faster without sacrificing accuracy. In our framework, this approximation reduces the full reference set to a custom panel for each study haplotype in each part of the genome. The approximation is similar to the one that drives the phasing algorithm of IMPUTE version 2 (IMPUTE2; Howie et al. 2009), and we have implemented it in the same software package. We evaluate our framework by running extensive cross-validations in HapMap 3 and in African data from the MalariaGEN Project (Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network 2008). With a more detailed panel selection scheme as a benchmark, we find that our approach produces high imputation accuracy in all populations considered, with the greatest benefits at low-frequency variants. We also use simulated data to show that our approximation substantially reduces the computational cost of adding haplotypes to a reference set. We further demonstrate that an implementation of our framework is faster and more accurate than another leading method (Beagle; Browning and Browning 2009) when imputing from large, sequence-based reference panels. On the basis of our results, we discuss general computational strategies for balancing efficiency and accuracy, and we explain how our methodology can be combined with other techniques for speeding up imputation. We have tied together numerous threads from the literature to create a coherent, efficient, and accurate framework for imputing genotypes from modern reference datasets. Imputation-based GWAS are beginning to harness the power of thousands of reference genomes, and we expect that the practical solutions provided here will help investigators make the most of these rich genetic resources.'","b""Genotype imputation is a statistical technique that is often used to increase the power and resolution of genetic association studies. Imputation methods work by using haplotype patterns in a reference panel to predict unobserved genotypes in a study dataset, and a number of approaches have been proposed for choosing subsets of reference haplotypes that will maximize accuracy in a given study population.

We have tied together numerous threads from the literature to create a coherent, efficient, and accurate framework for imputing genotypes from modern reference datasets. Imputation-based GWAS are beginning to harness the power of thousands of reference genomes, and we expect that the practical solutions provided here will help investigators make the most of these rich genetic resources. We begin by describing the basic IMPUTE2 algorithm, which will be retained in this work with some modifications. Full details of the original algorithm are available in Howie et al. (2009). Although that paper addressed the use of multiple reference panels typed on different SNP sets (\xe2\x80\x9cScenario B\xe2\x80\x9d in their terminology), for simplicity we will focus on the situation where the reference haplotypes are all defined on the same SNPs (\xe2\x80\x9cScenario A\xe2\x80\x9d). Although we do not discuss Scenario B in this paper, the ideas presented here are easily extended to that setting. IMPUTE2 uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that alternates between phasing typed SNPs and imputing untyped SNPs. Each MCMC iteration includes two steps: 1. Sample a new phase configuration for each study individual, using information from other study individuals and reference panel haplotypes at SNPs typed in the study. 2. Given the newly sampled haplotypes for all study individuals, treat each haplotype as independent (conditional on the reference panel) and analytically impute the alleles at untyped SNPs. This MCMC algorithm is run for a number of iterations (typically 30, including 10 burn-in iterations), then the probabilities from Step 2 are averaged across iterations to produce marginal posterior genotype probabilities at each untyped SNP. The phasing and imputation calculations are driven by the hidden Markov model (HMM) of Li and Stephens (2003). This model can be used to update an individual's haplotypes by constructing them as \xe2\x80\x9cimperfect mosaic\xe2\x80\x9d copies of a set of template haplotypes. In the simplest case, the templates would include all reference+study haplotypes (minus the pair being updated) in Step 1 and all reference haplotypes in Step 2. To reduce the computational burden of Step 1, Howie et al. (2009) introduced an approximation that restricts each phasing update to a set of k template haplotypes, which are chosen separately for each individual at each iteration; the other templates are implicitly assigned copying probabilities of zero. The k templates are chosen by computing Hamming distances between an individual's current sampled haplotypes and each possible template haplotype. We refer to the k templates with the smallest distances as \xe2\x80\x9csurrogate family members\xe2\x80\x9d because they (ideally) share recent ancestry with the study individual. [These haplotypes were called \xe2\x80\x9cinformed conditioning states\xe2\x80\x9d in the Howie et al. (2009) paper and early versions of the IMPUTE2 documentation. We now prefer the nomenclature used here because of the approximation\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to the \xe2\x80\x9csurrogate parent\xe2\x80\x9d phasing method of Kong et al. (2008).] Howie et al. (2009) used the surrogate family approximation to speed up the phasing updates in IMPUTE2 (Step 1 of the MCMC algorithm described above), but they used all available reference haplotypes for the imputation updates (Step 2). To make computation faster in large, ancestrally diverse reference panels, we now extend the approximation to imputation updates. To decide which reference haplotypes to copy at a particular point in an IMPUTE2 run, we add an extra step between Steps 1 and 2. After individual i has sampled a new haplotype pair in Step 1, we calculate the Hamming distance from each of these haplotypes to each of the reference haplotypes, using only the overlapping SNPs. Then, separately for each of individual i 's haplotypes, we perform Step 2 (haploid imputation of untyped alleles) using only the khap nearest reference haplotypes as templates. This procedure is not guaranteed to identify khap unique haplotypes as multiple haplotypes near the khap cutoff may have the same Hamming distance. In these situations, we select a random subset of the boundary haplotypes to produce a reference panel with khap states. Intuitively, our approach corresponds to imputing each study haplotype from a \xe2\x80\x9ccustom\xe2\x80\x9d reference panel containing close genealogical neighbors. We generally choose larger values for khap than for k because phasing updates require evaluation of k2/2 HMM states per individual per SNP, whereas imputation updates require evaluation of only khap states. To assess the accuracy of genotype imputation from reference panels of diverse ancestry, we performed leave-one-out cross-validations in data from HapMap Phase 3. The HapMap 3 paper (The International HapMap Consortium 2010) includes a number of similar comparisons, which use a series of carefully controlled experiments to show how population ancestry in the reference and study data affects imputation accuracy. By contrast, our main goal is to validate a general strategy for using ancestrally diverse reference data. One way to view this distinction is that their experiments provide information about the kinds of reference data one might want to collect to improve imputation accuracy in a given population, whereas our experiments illustrate a strategy for getting good results from whichever data are available. To the extent that we consider how reference panels of different ancestries affect imputation accuracy, the main point is to guide intuition about why the overall strategy works. All of our experiments were based on phased haplotypes from HapMap 3, release 2, in NCBI Build 36 coordinates. HapMap 3 includes samples from 11 analysis panels, which are listed in Table 1. After some minor processing (which is described in the Table 1 legend), there was a total of 1011 unrelated individuals from 10 panels in this dataset. Recent work on the HapMap data has revealed a small number of close relatives among these putative unrelateds (Pemberton et al. 2010). We conducted the analyses for this study before those relationships were revealed, but we do not anticipate that removing the related individuals would have a major effect on our results or conclusions. The HapMap 3 samples were genotyped on both the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 platform and the Illumina 1M Human platform. For our cross-validations, we masked the SNPs not typed on the Affymetrix platform in one individual at a time, then imputed the masked genotypes from the haplotypes of other HapMap 3 individuals; details about which individuals were included in the reference panel are provided below. We also masked the phase of the observed genotypes in the individual being imputed. For these experiments, we used all of the HapMap 3 SNPs on chromosome 20, which led to 16,606 non-Affymetrix SNPs being imputed from 19,650 Affymetrix SNPs. We also repeated the experiments after reversing the roles of the SNP platforms, with results shown in File S3. Once every individual in a panel had been masked and imputed, we assessed accuracy at each SNP as the squared Pearson correlation (R2) between the masked genotypes, which take values in {0,1,2}, and the imputed allele dosages (also known as posterior mean genotypes), which take values in [0,2]. The allele dosage is defined for each genotype G as , where Pr (G = x) is a marginal posterior probability generated by an imputation method. Once the correlation R2 had been measured for every masked SNP, we calculated the mean R2 across SNPs and reported this as a scalar summary of imputation accuracy in that cross-validation experiment. In rare situations, the correlation at a SNP was undefined because the imputation produced identical allele dosages for all individuals. In these cases, we set R2 = 0 to capture the intuition that there would be no power to detect an effect at such SNPs. We note that the HapMap 3 samples were phased together in continental groups, which implies that the absolute accuracies in this experiment may be slightly optimistic. However, our main focus is on the relative accuracy of different reference panel configurations, so the non-independence of cross-validation samples is not a meaningful shortcoming. We repeated this experiment for each of the 10 HapMap 3 panels in Table 1 under various conditions. To understand the benefits and drawbacks of different reference panel compositions, we sequentially added HapMap 3 panels to the reference set and re-imputed after each addition. Adding the panels in all possible orders is combinatorically daunting and of dubious interpretive value, and we preferred to have an objective ordering, so we added panels in order of increasing pairwise FST to the cross-validation panel. We calculated FST between each pair of panels as the average across all HapMap 3 SNPs on the autosomes. The panel orderings induced by this criterion are shown in File S1. We also considered different orderings \xe2\x80\x93 e.g. adding panels as dictated by a greedy algorithm based on cross-validation accuracy \xe2\x80\x93 but these did not change our qualitative results (data not shown). Up to this point, we have described 10 separate cross-validation experiments for each HapMap 3 panel: a cross-validation within the panel of interest, followed by 9 additional experiments with successively more inclusive reference panels. We also wanted to assess the sensitivity of the inference to the khap parameter in IMPUTE2, so we repeated each of these experiments across a grid of khap values: 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, and 2020 (which is the total number of HapMap 3 haplotypes, 2022, minus the two haplotypes of the masked individual). By definition, khap cannot exceed the number of haplotypes in the reference panel, so each reference configuration used only the values that were consistent with its panel size. Each configuration also used a special khap value that was set to the total number of reference haplotypes in that experiment, since this value seldom fell on a grid point. We performed these experiments with IMPUTE version 2.1.2 under the following settings: k = 80 (tuning parameter for phasing updates), iter = 30 (total number of MCMC iterations), burnin = 10 (number of iter to discard as burn-in), hap_spec_fam (flag to make the program choose a custom reference panel for each study haplotype), and Ne = 20000. The Ne parameter represents the effective size of the population being analyzed, and it is used to scale the recombination rates in the imputation HMM. It may seem odd that we use a single Ne value in populations that clearly have different effective sizes, but our pilot experiments showed that IMPUTE2 is largely insensitive to this parameter and that 20000 is a good universal value (data not shown). The approximations underlying the k and khap parameters are modeled on local genealogies with limited recombination, so we split chromosome 20 into nonoverlapping 5-Mb chunks for analysis, with a 250-kb buffer region on each side to prevent edge effects (this is a default setting in IMPUTE2). It is useful to run a separate imputation method as an external benchmark. We chose to compare against Beagle (Browning and Browning 2009) because past results showed that it could be competitive on a dataset of this scale (Browning and Browning 2009; Howie et al. 2009; Jostins et al. 2011). Beagle has already been compared with IMPUTE2 in a large, well-matched reference panel of European ancestry (Howie et al. 2009), so to simplify the presentation we applied it only to the cosmopolitan HapMap 3 reference panels. We used Beagle version 3.0.2 with default settings for all experiments presented here. To facilitate parallel computation, we ran Beagle on the same 5-Mb chromosome chunks (with buffers) that were used by IMPUTE2. We also attempted to use a \xe2\x80\x9ccoalescent-based\xe2\x80\x9d method for choosing custom reference panels (Pasaniuc et al. 2010), but we could not get it to produce accurate results on our data; see File S6 for details. We omitted another leading imputation method, MaCH (Li et al. 2010), because it was not computationally feasible with the full HapMap 3 panel at the time of these experiments. Both IMPUTE2 and MaCH have recently been made more efficient through \xe2\x80\x9cpre-phasing\xe2\x80\x9d of GWAS genotypes (the MaCH implementation is called \xe2\x80\x9cminimac\xe2\x80\x9d). While we did not evaluate these approaches here, we have found that pre-phasing is complementary to our khap approximation in preliminary experiments, as we explain in the Discussion. All else being equal, we would expect minimac to achieve similar accuracy to IMPUTE2 since both methods are based on the Li and Stephens (2003) model of DNA sequence variation, although further work may be needed to compare these methods in various contexts. To evaluate strategies for reference panel construction in African populations, we performed cross-validation experiments in genotypes that were kindly provided by the Malaria Genetic Epidemiology Network (MalariaGEN; Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network 2008). The data we used were collected by MalariaGEN investigators for genome-wide association studies of human resistance or susceptibility to severe malaria. The individuals in these datasets were recruited at medical centers in the Gambia and Ghana; we henceforth refer to these samples by the tags GMB and GHN, respectively, with the understanding that they may not represent the full spectrum of genetic diversity in the countries of origin. Further details about the study recruitment are available at www.malariagen.net. Each dataset consists of trios (658 from GMB and 608 from GHN) that were ascertained via proband children diagnosed with malaria in hospitals. The members of each trio were genotyped on the Illumina 650Y array, with the genotypes subjected to standard quality control procedures and phased by Beagle with trio information. MalariaGEN carried out the genotyping and data processing, then provided us with inferred haplotypes for the trio parents (1316 GMB individuals and 1216 GHN individuals) in NCBI Build 36 coordinates. As in the HapMap 3 comparisons, our main goal in designing a cross-validation experiment was to provide guidance on how to use existing and future imputation reference panels. We chose to focus on the GMB panel because genotype imputation has previously been evaluated in a Gambian GWAS (Jallow et al. 2009) and because the 1000 Genomes Project is planning to sequence a set of individuals from the Gambia. To mimic the planned 1000 Genomes Gambian dataset, we randomly allocated 100 GMB individuals to a reference panel. We also formed a reference panel from 100 randomly chosen GHN individuals. Ghana is located between Nigeria (the source of the HapMap YRI panel) and the Gambia on the Atlantic coast of Africa, so this panel contains reference haplotypes sampled nearer to the location of interest than those in the HapMap data. We used the remaining 1216 GMB individuals as a validation set to model imputation into a Gambian GWAS. We imputed the GMB genotypes from a series of reference panels: all 2022 HapMap 3 (HM3) haplotypes; 200 GMB haplotypes (GMB); 200 GMB haplotypes plus 200 GHN haplotypes (GMB+GHN); and a combined set containing all 2422 GMB, GHN, and HM3 haplotypes (GMB+GHN+HM3). For each reference panel, we masked and imputed every 25th SNP in the GMB validation set, then repeated this analysis in a sliding window so that every genotyped SNP was imputed exactly once. To mimic a GWAS of unrelated individuals, we treated the nonmasked genotypes in the GMB validation set as unphased. We masked and imputed all available Illumina 650Y SNPs on chromosomes 20 and 11 (we added chromosome 11 to raise the counts of low-frequency SNPs, which are underrepresented in this dataset), except for those that were not typed in or had allele conflicts with HapMap 3, yielding a total of 40,300 SNPs for imputation. As in the HapMap 3 cross-validations, we split the chromosomes into non-overlapping 5-Mb regions to speed up the analysis and support IMPUTE2\xe2\x80\x99s computational approximations. We also wanted to compare against Beagle on reference panels of primarily African ancestry, so we generated another reference panel called \xe2\x80\x9cHM3.afr\xe2\x80\x9d that included the HapMap3 haplotypes from the ASW, LWK, MKK, and YRI panels (822 haplotypes). We then used IMPUTE2 and Beagle to impute genotypes in the 1216 Gambians based on two reference panels: GMB (200 haplotypes) and GMB+GHN+HM3.afr (1222 haplotypes). We masked the SNPs as described above, except that this time we masked every 13th SNP so that Beagle would treat the data as it would a standard GWAS analysis. (Beagle invokes a different model-fitting strategy when fewer than 7% of the genotypes are missing from the study dataset.) To produce computational benchmarks in a realistic imputation scenario, we simulated data that model the large, ancestrally diverse reference panel that is being generated by the 1000 Genomes Project. Our simulations were based on the sfs_code program (Hernandez 2008), which uses a pre-specified demographic model (typically obtained from unbiased site frequency spectra) and DNA sequence annotations to drive a forward simulation that models the effects of genetic drift and natural selection on a population of chromosomes. Ryan Hernandez kindly provided us with the output of an sfs_code run that used a joint demographic model of three HapMap panels (CEU, CHB, and YRI) on chromosome 17p12 (a 4.7-Mb region). At the end of the forward simulation, the program sampled 10,000 haplotypes from each of the three populations. These haplotypes do not capture the full demographic complexity of the 1000 Genomes sample set, but the simulation does provide realistic DNA sequence data for three major sources of human genetic variation. Given these simulated sequences, we sought to create imputation reference panels that would capture features of the anticipated 1000 Genomes panels. We mirrored the overall size of the 1000 Genomes reference set by sampling a panel of 1600 chromosomes from each population, which yielded a total of 4800 chromosomes worldwide, just under the 1000 Genomes target of 5000. The genome-wide sequencing module of the 1000 Genomes Project is based on a low-coverage design, so a certain fraction of low-frequency variants will be missed in the real data. To mimic this ascertainment process, we used power calculations from the 1000 Genomes pilot paper (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2010) to determine the chances of discovering SNPs with different numbers of variant allele copies. The discovery probabilities are shown in Table S2; we applied them separately in each set of 1600 reference chromosomes, under the assumption that true SNPs are discovered (or not) independently of each other. Conditional on a SNP being discovered in any panel, we assumed it was genotyped perfectly in all three panels. This is a reasonable assumption for a benchmarking experiment because sporadic genotyping errors are unlikely to have a noticeable effect on a program\xe2\x80\x99s computational burden. Having simulated a reference panel, we then simulated a GWAS dataset as the target for imputation. Of the 8400 CEU-like haplotypes from sfs_code that were not included in the reference set, we selected 2000 and randomly paired them to create a GWAS sample of 1000 individuals. We thinned this dataset to the approximate SNP density and MAF distribution observed in real Affymetrix 500k data on a set of British controls [the 1958 Birth Cohort of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007)]. We imputed our simulated GWAS dataset from two different reference panels: a \xe2\x80\x9cCosmopolitan\xe2\x80\x9d panel containing the full set of 4800 haplotypes and a \xe2\x80\x9cEuropean\xe2\x80\x9d panel containing 1000 haplotypes sampled from the 1600 CEU-like reference chromosomes. The first panel models the worldwide 1000 Genomes set, whereas the second panel models a single cluster of related populations (roughly speaking, the 1000 Genomes samples will be divided among five such clusters containing 500 individuals each). By imputing from both reference panels, we can see how reference panel size and diversity affect the computational loads of different imputation methods. To provide a simple benchmark, we selected an imputation region that contained exactly 10,000 polymorphic sites in the European panel of 1000 haplotypes; this yielded the 1.9-Mb interval [11200000,13096366] on chromosome 17. This region contains a larger number of SNPs in the Cosmopolitan reference panel, but we restricted that panel to the same 10,000 SNPs to simplify the comparison. In practice, GWAS investigators may perform similar filtering on Cosmopolitan reference panels to remove variants that are underpowered in a particular study. For each 10,000-SNP reference panel, we imputed the 1,000 GWAS individuals using IMPUTE v2.1.2 and Beagle v3.0.2. We used the default settings for both methods (for IMPUTE2, the default khap setting is 500), and we also ran IMPUTE2 with khap set to include all available reference haplotypes. We recorded the single-processor running times and memory requirements for each run. We performed a series of experiments to evaluate our proposed imputation framework, which combines a cosmopolitan reference panel with a new approximation for speeding up imputation from large reference datasets. We implemented our approximation within IMPUTE2, which uses an iterative algorithm to impute untyped variants in GWAS datasets. Whereas the original algorithm imputes genotypes from the full set of reference haplotypes, the new approximation imputes each study haplotype from a custom subset of reference haplotypes. (Study genotypes seldom come with known phase, but the haplotypes can be inferred as part of the algorithm.) Each of these custom reference panels includes the khap reference haplotypes that have the fewest allele differences with a study haplotype at overlapping SNPs, where khap is a user-defined parameter that controls the computational cost o",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 imputation. If this method is applied over a limited genomic region (e.g. a few million base pairs rather than a whole chromosome), we expect the khap reference haplotypes to be enriched for those that share recent common ancestry with the study haplotype of interest. We refer to these haplotypes as \xe2\x80\x9csurrogate family members\xe2\x80\x9d because, like real family members, they may share segments of nearly identical DNA that can be used for imputation. We explore the relationship between khap and accuracy in the results that follow, and we provide practical suggestions for applying this approximation in the Discussion. We first tested our proposed imputation framework on a chromosome 20 dataset from HapMap 3. This dataset includes hundreds of haplotypes from each of several locations around the world, making it a good qualitative model for future reference panels like those being generated by the 1000 Genomes Project. The HapMap 3 panels used in this study are described in Table 1; note that we combined the CHB and JPT panels for this analysis. Within each of the 10 panels, we masked a set of SNPs in one individual at a time and used IMPUTE2 to infer the hidden genotypes. We repeated this procedure across a range of khap values and with various reference panels, which were creating by cumulatively adding HapMap 3 panels in the order dictated by genome-wide average FST. One way to think of this procedure is to imagine building a composite reference panel for a population of interest: we start with a population-specific reference panel, and we successively add more-diverged panels to see if they will help (or possibly hurt) the imputation accuracy. These composite panels capture aspects of the Huang et al. (2009a) cross-validation strategy for choosing reference sets, and they provide population-label-informed benchmarks against which to compare our label-free way of using reference data. In this section, we present results for the ASW (African American) and TSI (Italian) panels, which exhibit general trends and unexpected outcomes from our HapMap 3 cross-validations. Figure 1 shows how imputation accuracy depends on reference panel composition and the number of surrogate family haplotypes chosen from each composite panel (khap). We constructed these plots in ways that highlight interesting features, and we restricted the results to SNPs with MAF < 5% in the target panel. We provide analogous plots for all HapMap 3 target panels in File S1. Imputation accuracy at low-frequency SNPs in HapMap 3 cross-validations in ASW and TSI, as a function of reference panel composition and khap value. These plots show the imputation accuracy of IMPUTE2 in (A) the ASW panel and (B) the TSI panel. The accuracy of each experiment is plotted on the y-axis as the mean R2 across all SNPs with MAF < 5% in the cross-validation panel (identified by the gray box in each plot). The x-axis shows the khap parameter, which scales linearly with the computational burden of imputation updates in IMPUTE2. Each curve represents a different reference panel, with panels added cumulatively in the order shown in the legends, reading from bottom to top. Similar plots for other HapMap 3 target panels can be found in File S1. The x-axis shows the value of the khap parameter, and the y-axis shows the imputation accuracy, which is measured as the mean SNP-wise R2 between true and imputed allele dosages (posterior mean genotypes) for each cross-validation experiment. The computational cost of imputation is roughly proportional to khap. Applying different khap settings to a single reference panel generates a curve, and each curve represents a different reference panel. (For further details of the R2 distributions underlying the mean values at khap = 500, see File S2.) Each individual was imputed initially from haplotypes in the same panel, then from reference sets that cumulatively added panels in the order shown in the plot legends, reading from bottom to top. The black curves represent our suggested strategy of using a cosmopolitan reference panel. One observation from Figure 1 is that the full set of reference haplotypes generated some of the highest accuracy levels in this experiment \xe2\x80\x93 the black curves almost always lie above the other curves. As we show in Figure 2 and File S3, this holds true across HapMap 3 target panels, genotyping arrays, and SNP frequency classes. Another salient feature of Figure 1 is that the curves plateau quickly with increasing values of khap (moving from left to right within each plot). This shows that our surrogate family approximation can decrease computing time without losing accuracy. For example, the runs that selected 500 haplotypes from the full HapMap 3 panel (khap = 500; black curves) achieved similar accuracy to the runs that didn't use this approximation (khap = 2020), but the first set of runs was about four times faster. Imputation accuracy at low-frequency SNPs in HapMap 3 cross-validations, as a function of target panel, reference panel composition, khap value, and imputation method. These plots show the imputation accuracy of IMPUTE2 and Beagle in various cross-validation experiments. The accuracy of each experiment is plotted on the y-axis as the mean R2 across all SNPs with MAF < 5% in the cross-validation panel (identified by the gray box in each plot). The x-axis shows the khap parameter, which scales linearly with the computational burden of imputation updates in IMPUTE2. The solid black curves show how R2 varies with khap when using IMPUTE2 with a reference panel containing the full set of 2020 HapMap 3 haplotypes; the dashed black lines show the accuracy of Beagle with this reference panel. IMPUTE2 was also applied to subpanels of the full HapMap 3 panel, with results shown as orange curves. Similar plots for other observed SNP sets and imputed SNP MAFs can be found in File S3. Figure 1 also shows how imputation accuracy improved as particular panels were added to the reference set. The trends for the ASW panel (Figure 1A) are basically as expected: each successive African panel (MKK, LWK, and YRI) improved the accuracy incrementally, and the panels that capture components of European ancestry (MXL, GIH, TSI, and CEU) collectively raised the accuracy to its maximum value for this experiment. The east Asian panels (CHB+JPT and CHD) did not increase imputation accuracy any further, but nor did they reduce it; this demonstrates the ability of the method to ignore unhelpful reference haplotypes. The results for the TSI panel (Figure 1B) are more surprising. As we would expect, accuracy improved with the addition of each panel that contains recent European ancestry (CEU and MEX). The GIH panel also increased the accuracy, which is reasonable given the relatively modest genetic divergence between this panel and TSI. Perhaps unexpectedly, the maximum imputation accuracy in TSI was not achieved until a set of African haplotypes (MKK) was added to the reference panel. This improvement was also observed when adding MKK haplotypes to the reference set for CEU imputation (File S1). Supplementary results from the HapMap 3 paper (The International HapMap Consortium 2010) show that the MKK panel has an admixture component that could reflect an ancient migration from Europe or the Middle East into eastern Africa, which might explain our results, although we observed a similar increase in accuracy after replacing the MKK panel with the remaining African panels (data not shown). Regardless of the underlying explanation, these results highlight the complexity of human demographic history, which is one motivation for frameworks like ours that use inclusive reference panels without population labels. Notably, the common SNPs did not follow all of the patterns seen here for low-frequency SNPs (see File S3.) A cosmopolitan reference panel produced high imputation accuracy in both frequency classes, but the accuracy at common SNPs came almost entirely from the most closely related panels. For example, the maximum accuracy at common SNPs in TSI was attained with a TSI+CEU reference panel, and the addition of other panels neither increased nor decreased the accuracy. Hence, our results confirm that cosmopolitan reference panels are benign for imputing common variants, while showing that such panels can be positively helpful for imputing low-frequency variants. This difference can be understood in terms of the representation of the minor allele in the reference panel: common alleles are usually well-represented in population-matched panels of nontrivial size, whereas low-frequency alleles may be present in only a few copies or absent entirely, depending on allele frequency, SNP ascertainment scheme, and the number of reference haplotypes. Additional copies of these alleles (and their associated haplotype backgrounds) may sometimes be found in other populations, which explain why a cosmopolitan reference panel can improve imputation accuracy at low-frequency variants. These statements are supported by the results in File S2. We now extend the results from Figure 1 to the full set of HapMap 3 panels and a competing imputation method. We chose to compare against Beagle (Browning and Browning 2009) because past studies showed that it could achieve competitive speed and accuracy with large reference panels (Browning and Browning 2009; Howie et al. 2009; Jostins et al. 2011). The high-level results of our cross-validation experiment are shown in Figure 2. As before, the solid black curves depict IMPUTE2 results with our suggested strategy of using a cosmopolitan reference panel, and different points on the x-axis correspond to different values of khap. Here, the multicolored curves from Figure 1 (which represent imputation from subsets of the HapMap 3 haplotypes) are replaced with orange curves. The identities of the orange curves are omitted for plotting clarity, but full details are provided in File S1. We imputed and evaluated 1,523-2,364 low-frequency SNPs per HapMap 3 panel, with the exact numbers provided in Table S1. The black dashed lines in Figure 2 show the results of using Beagle with the full HapMap 3 reference panel; these lines are flat because Beagle does not have an analog of the khap parameter. As in Figure 1, our proposed framework always produced near-maximal accuracy. Also as before, the solid black curves typically reach their highest accuracy values at small values of khap. Figure 2 shows that IMPUTE2 achieved higher accuracy than Beagle in every panel, except at the lowest khap settings. In some target panels, the difference between methods was small; for example, IMPUTE2 was only slightly more accurate than Beagle in the CEU and TSI panels, which is consistent with previous results comparing these methods on a European dataset (Howie et al. 2009). [We note that Jostins et al. (2011) reached the contradictory conclusion that Beagle is more accurate than IMPUTE2 when imputing Europeans from diverse reference panels. We believe that their conclusion was driven by spurious IMPUTE2 results, as we explain in File S4.] On the other hand, IMPUTE2 was more accurate by a large margin in the African panels (YRI, LWK, and MKK). These trends cannot be attributed to the fact that we are running Beagle with a stratified reference panel when the method is not designed for that situation: IMPUTE2 also produced higher accuracy when we used reference panels that were well-matched to the target panels, both in the current HapMap 3 framework (data not shown) and in our MalariaGEN analyses (results below). We further note that the Beagle results shown here are better than the ones we obtained with smaller, less diverse HapMap 3 reference sets (data not shown). We tried running Beagle with larger values of its niterations and nsamples parameters, but there was essentially no change in these results (data not shown). We speculate on the mechanistic reasons for the accuracy differences between IMPUTE2 and Beagle in the Discussion. A subtle feature of Figure 2 is that not all of the IMPUTE2 curves are monotonically increasing with khap: some of the black curves peak at intermediate values of this parameter, then steadily decay as khap grows to its maximum value of 2,020. This trend is clearest in the YRI panel, but it is also observable in other panels. There should be few problems of statistical computation (e.g. failure of the MCMC algorithm to converge) in our leave-one-out experiments, so we assume that this result reflects a real feature of the method. Our interpretation is that restricting the reference set via khap actually imposes a more appropriate prior distribution on the haplotype copying probabilities when there is significant population structure in the panel. Tuning this prior by changing khap has only a small effect on mean accuracy, which implies that our imputation method is largely robust to stratified reference data even without the surrogate family approximation. At the same time, this result implies that choosing custom reference panels may have benefits beyond just speeding up the computation, which is consistent with the conclusions of Pasaniuc et al. (2010). It is not straightforward to compare these results to those of Huang et al. (2009a) because our experimental design is somewhat different. Nonetheless, we believe that our basic conclusions align with theirs. For example, we observed that the imputation accuracy with a worldwide reference panel (khap = 2020) was never much lower than the accuracy with the optimal khap (peaks of black curves in Figure 2), and the Huang et al. (2009a) results show a similar trend for cosmopolitan vs. optimal mixtures of HapMap 2 panels. In this sense, our khap approximation can be viewed as a flexible and automatic way of implementing the Huang et al. (2009a) panel selection approach with an arbitrarily large number of reference populations. To assess whether our imputation strategy would yield similar benefits in African populations outside the HapMap 3 set, we performed additional cross-validations in a Gambian dataset from the Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network (MalariaGEN; Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network 2008). Previous work on imputing Gambians in a disease study found that the HapMap 2 YRI panel produced weaker association signals than did a Gambia-specific panel at the strongly selected beta-globin gene (Jallow et al. 2009). Here, we extend that work to examine imputation accuracy in larger reference panels and a broader variety of loci. We also rephrase the question to ask whether haplotypes sampled outside The Gambia can improve accuracy when a dedicated Gambian panel is available. To answer these questions, we masked and imputed 40,300 SNPs from the Illumina 650Y array in a set of 1216 Gambian individuals from MalariaGEN. We repeated the analysis for each of four reference panels: all 2022 HapMap 3 haplotypes (HM3); 200 Gambian haplotypes (GMB); 200 Gambian haplotypes plus 200 Ghanaian haplotypes (GMB+GHN); and all of the aforementioned panels combined (GMB+GHN+HM3; 2422 haplotypes). For each imputation run, we used IMPUTE2 with khap = 500. In reference panels with fewer than 500 haplotypes, we reduced khap to the number of available haplotypes. The results are shown in Figure 3, which breaks down the imputation accuracy by the minor allele frequencies of the SNPs in the 1216 imputed Gambians. Imputation accuracy in Gambian validation set as a function of reference panel composition and minor allele frequency. These plots show the accuracy obtained when imputing masked SNPs in 1216 Gambian individuals from the MalariaGEN dataset using IMPUTE2 with khap = 500. Each reference panel is represented by a different color, and the results are shown for (A) all SNPs and (B) SNPs with MAF < 10% in the Gambian validation set. The results are binned by MAF, with 5% bins in (A) and 1% bins in (B). Each point on a curve is located in the middle of the corresponding MAF bin. The following reference panel codes are used in the legend: GMB (Gambia, 200 haplotypes); GHN (Ghana, 200 haplotypes); and HM3 (HapMap 3, 2022 haplotypes). Figure 3A shows the results for all imputed SNPs, whereas Figure 3B is restricted to SNPs with MAF < 10%. We omitted SNPs with MAF < 1% from both plots as there were too few of these to provide reliable measurements. Like previous authors (Jallow et al. 2009), we found that a Gambia-specific reference set outperformed a HapMap set that did not include Gambians: the GMB panel (blue curves) produced higher overall accuracy than did the HM3 panel (red curves), despite the fact that there were \xe2\x88\xbc800 chromosomes of African ancestry in the HM3 set and only 200 chromosomes in the GMB set. This suggests that historical divergence between the populations in the HapMap 3 and Gambian panels makes HapMap 3 less accurate as an imputation resource. The HapMap 3 panel is still useful, however. Across the allele frequency spectrum, the difference in mean R2 between the GMB and HM3 panels was never larger than 2.5%, and the difference was smallest at low-frequency SNPs. In fact, the HM3 panel was more accurate than the GMB panel for SNPs in the 1\xe2\x80\x932% and 2\xe2\x80\x933% MAF bands (Figure 3B); this shows that an ancestrally inclusive, nonspecific reference panel can capture low-frequency alleles that are poorly represented in a Gambia-specific panel. A recent simulation study found that association power and mean imputation R2 have a roughly linear relationship with a slope near 1.0 (Zheng et al. 2011), which suggests that using the HM3 panel in place of the GMB panel would cause only a small loss of power in an imputation-based association scan. [We note that the results from Zheng et al. (2011) appear to conflict with those of a recent study by Huang et al. (2009b), which found that power drops quickly with mean R2. We believe that the Zheng et al. (2011) results more accurately reflect this relationship because the mathematical model of imputation errors used by Huang et al. ignores the correlation of imputation error across individuals, which could be substantial, e.g. at hard-to-impute SNPs. Figure 3 also shows that non-Gambian panels can improve imputation accuracy in the presence of a Gambian panel: the orange curve represents the addition of haplotypes from a moderately diverged population (GHN) and the black curve represents the further addition of a worldwide reference panel (HM3). These results support our strategy of using cosmopolitan reference panels: regardless of which reference data are available, the highest accuracy is achieved when using all available haplotypes and letting the imputation method decide which ones to use. Aside from these questions of reference panel composition, we can also ask whether the choice of imputation method matters in African datasets. Our HapMap 3 comparisons suggest that Beagle has trouble imputing African genotypes, and we wanted to see if this conclusion would hold up in the MalariaGEN data. To address this, we used Beagle to impute the Gambian validation set using two different reference panels: (i) the GMB panel and (ii) a composite reference set containing the GMB panel, the GHN panel, and the HM3 panels with majority African ancestry (ASW, LWK, MKK, and YRI). We decided to reduce the HM3 set to these panels (which we label \xe2\x80\x9cHM3.afr\xe2\x80\x9d) in case Beagle\xe2\x80\x99s difficulties in the previous comparisons were caused by the inclusion of non-African haplotypes in the reference panel. For consistency, we also imputed from the GMB+GHN+HM3.afr panel with IMPUTE2. The results of this comparison are shown in Figure 4. Results based on the GMB panel are shown in blue, while results based on the GMB+GHN+HM3.afr panel are shown in gray. Accuracy curves for IMPUTE2 and Beagle are drawn with solid and dashed lines, respectively. In concurrence with our previous results on African populations, we found that Beagle was much less accurate than IMPUTE2 when provided with the same reference panel: for each color, the solid line in Figure 4 is consistently above the dashed line. In fact, IMPUTE2 achieved higher accuracy when imputing from 200 GMB haplotypes (solid blue line) than Beagle did when imputing from 1222 African haplotypes (dashed gray line), of which the 200 GMB were a subset. The difference between methods was largest at low-frequency SNPs, but there was a substantial gap across the entire frequency spectrum. Comparison of imputation accuracy between IMPUTE2 and Beagle in Gambian validation set. This plot shows the accuracy obtained when imputing masked SNPs in 1216 Gambian individuals from the MalariaGEN dataset using either IMPUTE2 with khap = 500 (solid lines) or Beagle on default settings (dashed lines). Imputation was performed with a reference panel of Gambian haplotypes (blue) and a reference panel of Gambian, Ghanaian, and HapMap 3 African ancestry haplotypes (gray). The results are grouped into 5% MAF bins, and each point on a curve is located in the middle of the corresponding MAF bin. The following reference panel codes are used in the legend: GMB (Gambia, 200 haplotypes); GHN (Ghana, 200 haplotypes); and HM3.afr (HapMap 3 African ancestry, 822 haplotypes). We believe that Beagle's difficulties in imputing African datasets arise from properties of its clustering model. It is possible that Beagle could produce better results with different settings, although we tried varying both the model-fitting parameters (niterations, nsamples) and the model-building parameters (scale, shift) without observing a meaningful change in accuracy (data not shown). To provide computational benchmarks for the imputation methods used in this study, we simulated two reference panels: one containing 4800 haplotypes modeled on the ancestrally diverse reference dataset that is being produced by the 1000 Genomes Project, and another containing 1000 haplotypes modeled on the European component of the 1000 Genomes set. We restricted the panels to a shared set of 10,000 SNPs spanning 1.9 Mb of sequence, and we imputed from both panels into a simulated GWAS of 1000 European individuals. The GWAS samples were provided with genotypes at SNPs that mirror the properties of the Affymetrix 500k platform; there were 337 such SNPs in the simulated region. We imputed the simulated GWAS dataset from each reference panel using IMPUTE2 and Beagle. We ran Beagle on the same (default) settings as in the cross-validations, and we ran IMPUTE2 on two settings for each panel: khap = 500 and khap = N, where N is the number of haplotypes in the reference panel. As in the cross-validations, we fixed the IMPUTE2 phasing parameter at k = 80. Table 2 shows the single-processor running times and random-access memory (RAM) requirements of each program. We obtained these benchmarks from a single computer with 148 GB of RAM and a 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon processor. Table 2 illustrates the computational benefits of our surrogate family approximation. In the Cosmopolitan reference panel with 4800 haplotypes, reducing khap from 4800 to 500 decreased IMPUTE2\xe2\x80\x99s running time by a factor of 4.8. Another way of viewing this is to notice that with khap fixed at 500, IMPUTE2's running time increased by only a factor of 1.4 when moving from a panel with 1000 haplotypes to a panel with 4800 haplotypes. By comparison, Beagle's running time increased by a factor of 9 with the same panels. In this setting, fixing khap fixes the cost of the imputation calculations used by IMPUTE2, so the 1.4-fold increase in running time at khap = 500 reflects the additional time needed to evaluate a larger number of haplotypes when choosing which 500 to use for imputation. Preliminary experiments suggest that this evaluation step could be shortened by ignoring divergent haplotypes after the first few iterations of the algorithm (data not shown), which would make the overall running time almost independent of the number of reference haplotypes for fixed khap. On these kinds of imputation datasets, IMPUTE2 shows clear computational advantages over Beagle. Even when using a large, ancestrally diverse reference panel, IMPUTE2 finished in less time on default settings (127 min with khap = 500) than it took Beagle to impute from an ancestrally homogeneous panel with almost five times fewer haplotypes (655 min). IMPUTE2 also required much less RAM: for each reference panel, Beagle needed about 20 times more memory. These results, in combination with our cross-validation results, confirm that IMPUTE2 is both more accurate and more efficient than Beagle in the kinds of imputation datasets that are beginning to drive the field. As with any sophisticated inference method, there are ways to tweak Beagle's settings to achieve better speed, but all of them would reduce imputation accuracy. (Beagle's memory footprint can also be reduced, at the cost of even longer running times.) We explore some of the factors underlying these computational differences, and the implications they hold for future methods development, in the Discussion. For fixed k and khap, IMPUTE2\xe2\x80\x99s computational burden scales linearly with the number of study individuals, the number of reference haplotypes, the number of study SNPs, and the number of reference SNPs. Each of these factors makes a different per-unit contribution to the overall running time, with the number of study individuals and the number of reference SNPs having the biggest effect in modern datasets. Extrapolating the numbers from Table 2 to the entire genome and assuming the availability of 100 parallel computer processors, we predict that it would take IMPUTE2 about a day to impute 1000 individuals from a reference panel with thousands of sequenced haplotypes. For investigators with limited computational resources or very large GWAS cohorts, the imputation can be made even faster by prephasing the GWAS genotypes, as we explain in the Discussion. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies have made it feasible to obtain near-complete genome sequences from thousands of individuals. Association mapping studies will immediately benefit from these developments: whole-genome sequencing of large GWAS datasets will not be practical for a while yet; in the meantime, we can impute a wide range of genetic variation from genomes that have already been sequenced. Most of the mutations discovered in these genomes will occur at low population frequencies, so it is important that imputation strategies be tailored to capture low-frequency variants. As sequencing projects produce larger and more diverse reference datasets, imputation-based GWAS will also face practical challenges like choosing appropriate reference panels and keeping computation tractable. We have developed a coherent and convenient imputation framework that addresses these concerns. To simplify the process of choosing reference haplotypes from a diverse collection, our approach uses a cosmopolitan reference panel. Previous work suggested that cosmopolitan panels could increase imputation accuracy at low-frequency variants, and our results extend these findings to a wide range of human populations. It is computationally intensive to perform imputation with large, ancestrally diverse reference panels, so we have also developed an approximation that decreases the cost of adding haplotypes to a reference set without sacrificing accuracy. Our framework was motivated by the idea that larger reference datasets should make imputation faster and simpler, rather than slower and more complicated. We believe that our work represents a first step toward bridging current imputation practice with the paradigm suggested by Kong et al. (2008), in which large population samples eliminate the need for complex models and reference panel selection, and investigators do not have to balance efficiency and accuracy. Detailed population models and reference panel weighting schemes may provide modest accuracy improvements in the short term, but we expect that the power gains from such developments will seldom justify the added computational costs. Conversely, imputation strategies that are agnostic to population labels (as ours is) may become increasingly attractive as sequencing studies fill in the continuum of human genetic diversity. One benefit of such approaches is that they can capture unexpected allele sharing without needing to model the complexities of human demographic history, as we demonstrated by showing that African haplotypes can improve imputation accuracy in Europeans. Approaches like ours are also well-suited for imputation in recently admixed populations: methods that choose custom reference panels for different admixed individuals in different parts of the genome can increase accuracy by adapting to local ancestry changes, as previously suggested by Pasaniuc et al. (2010). The framework we have proposed can serve as a general approach for using reference data in current and future imputation studies, and we expect that it will spur additional methods development in this area. Below, we discuss the aspects of this framework that make it successful in modern reference panels, along with some practical and theoretical questions that may arise when extending the conclusions of this study to other datasets. Our cross-validation experiments have provided a wealth of information about how to use existing imputation resources like HapMap 3, but these datasets do not capture the full range of features that will be present in future reference panels. For example, our results are based on data from commercial SNP arrays, whose composition is biased toward variants that share alleles across populations. Consequently, population-specific accuracy contributions like the ones seen in Figure 1 should not be treated as quantitative predictions for newly discovered variants. While we could have used 1000 Genomes data to address the SNP ascertainment issue, the data available when we were preparing this manuscript contained smaller sample sizes and a narrower sampling of human genetic diversity than found in HapMap 3, so we decided to focus on the latter dataset as a model of future 1000 Genomes reference panels. We have run similar imputation experiments with an interim release of the 1000 Genomes Phase I haplotypes, and we have continued to see benefits from using ancestrally inclusive reference panels (B. Howie; unpublished data). In this work, we have highlighted the fact that combining reference data from different populations can improve imputation accuracy at low-frequency variants. This finding reflects both the limited sample sizes of existing reference panels and the shared ancestry of human populations: an allele that occurs at low frequency in a study population may be poorly represented in a well-matched reference panel due to sampling effects; however, that same allele may be found in reference sets from other populations due to genetic drift or introduction by recent migrants. While a multipopulation reference panel can improve accuracy at this kind of variant, there are other situations in which accuracy might be harmed by such panels. Possible mechanisms for decreased accuracy include (i) the imputation of variant alleles at sites that do not segregate in a study dataset, (ii) signal dilution from reference haplotypes that are similar to those in a study population but do not carry a variant allele that segregates in that population, and (iii) misleading results from reference haplotypes that carry recurrent mutations. We discuss these issues in File S5; we conclude that they will seldom hurt the imputation of low-frequency alleles from HapMap 3 or 1000 Genomes haplotypes, but that reference panel composition may need to be reevaluated when imputing rare alleles (MAF < 0.5%) or using other reference datasets. Another question to consider when applying our framework is whether the optimal number of surrogate family haplotypes will change with different reference datasets. Judging from our experience in a variety of studies, we suggest the rule of thumb that khap should be set to the number of reference haplotypes that have broadly similar ancestry to the study population. For example, the broad ancestral groupings in HapMap 3 (Europe, East Asia, Africa) each include 500\xe2\x80\x93800 haplotypes, and we found that khap = 500 worked well with this resource. Imputation accuracy is not highly sensitive to this variable, regardless of other factors like chunk size and local recombination rate, so it should not usually be necessary to optimize khap empirically. As reference sets grow and we further develop our approximation, we anticipate that it will be possible to achieve high accuracy with even lower values of khap. African populations pose a special challenge for imputation because they are among the most genetically diverse in the world (Rosenberg et al. 2010). Genetic relationships among African populations have been shaped by complex demographic histories, deep ancestries, and strong selective pressures, which can cause patterns of haplotype sharing in Africa to look much different than patterns in other parts of the world (Bryc et al. 2010; Campbell and Tishkoff 2008, 2010; Reed and Tishkoff 2006; Tishkoff et al. 2007, 2009). African populations also carry substantial burdens of common disease, yet few large-scale GWAS have been conducted in this setting. Efforts like the 1000 Genomes Project and MalariaGEN are changing this landscape, so it will be important to define effective reference panels for GWAS in a variety of African populations. We addressed this question by performing cross-validation experiments in Gambian individuals from MalariaGEN. In concurrence with a more limited analysis by Jallow et al. (2009), we found that a population-specific reference panel yielded higher average accuracy than did a larger HapMap 3 panel that lacked Gambian haplotypes. However, we also found that the HapMap 3 panel produced reasonable imputation accuracy across the allele frequency spectrum, and that non-Gambian haplotypes improved accuracy when added to a Gambia-specific reference panel. Although these findings were obtained from a limited sampling of African genetic diversity, they provide some intuition about general strategies for imputation in people of recent African ancestry. It will always help to collect new reference data through population-specific sequencing or genotyping, but the gains from this approach will often be larger in Africa. Whether or not a well-matched panel is available for a particular study population, imputing from all available haplotypes of African ancestry may often improve the results. Non-specific reference panels can weaken association signals near loci that have recently experienced strong selection, as with the beta-globin region in the Jallow et al. study, so it may be worthwhile to re-impute from just the ancestry-matched reference haplotypes (when such haplotypes are available) in regions showing decisive evidence of selective sweeps. Imputation methods based on the Li and Stephens (2003) model of DNA sequence variation (like IMPUTE2 and MaCH) are well suited to performing imputation in African GWAS. As shown in our HapMap 3 and MalariaGEN cross-validations, this kind of model can consistently produce higher accuracy than clustering approaches like the one used by Beagle, for reasons we discuss below. When the model is implemented via an efficient algorithm like IMPUTE2, this accuracy can be achieved at a fraction of the computational price. Looking ahead, we anticipate that many of the initial African GWAS will be conducted in west African populations; for example, such populations constitute a large part of MalariaGEN's Consortial Project 1. The power of these studies could potentially be boosted by using African American haplotypes to augment the reference sets collected in Africa. While there are clear merits to this idea, one might worry that the haplotype segments of non-African ancestry would pose problems for imputation. We can address this question by inspecting the IMPUTE2 results from our HapMap 3 cross-validations. Encouragingly, these results show that adding the HapMap 3 ASW panel to the reference set improved accuracy in every African cross-validation panel (File S1). Throughout our imputation experiments, we found that IMPUTE2 can attain both higher accuracy and faster computation than Beagle, which is a leading inference method for large datasets. We believe that the success of IMPUTE2 in this context can be attributed to its computational strategies and its model of DNA sequence variation. We discuss these attributes here in hopes that they will inform future methods development, and we address the role that prephasing can play in speeding up imputation. Beagle's basic modeling approach is to combine haplotypes into clusters. This speeds up computation because it restricts the number of HMM states that need to be considered: rather than perform HMM calculations on every haplotype in a dataset, Beagle can run the calculations on a smaller set of clusters. Similar state-reduction techniques are used by GERBIL (Kimmel and Shamir 2005), fastPHASE (Scheet and Stephens 2006), GEDI (Kennedy et al. 2008), and other related methods. By contrast, the basic HMM used by IMPUTE2 and MaCH includes a state for every haplotype. Using all of the states makes computation intractable, which is why IMPUTE2 restricts the states via its k and khap parameters. The intuition is that the \xe2\x80\x9csurrogate family members\xe2\x80\x9d identified in this way should include the most informative haplotypes for a particular individual in a particular part of the genome. Both of these state-reduction approaches speed up imputation, but our cross-validations show that IMPUTE2 attains higher accuracy than Beagle in practice, especially at low-frequency variants in datasets that have higher haplotype diversity (e.g. those with recent African ancestry). We suggest that this is because clustering models have inherent difficulties capturing low-frequency variation: by grouping similar haplotypes into clusters, these methods obscure the differences between those haplotypes, which reduces the ability to impute low-frequency variants. This could explain why the accuracy disparity between IMPUTE2 and Beagle was largest in African populations, which have higher genetic diversity than non-African populations and hence a larger fraction of low-frequency haplotypes. Methods like Beagle may be able to make up some of this ground by using more clusters, but this will further increase the computational load. These trends should persist as imputation datasets continue to grow: clustering models will need to add even more states to their HMMs to remain competitive on accuracy, whereas the closest k (or khap) surrogate family haplotypes will become even more informative, thereby enhancing the running time and accuracy advantages of methods like IMPUTE2. The natural endpoint of this process will arrive when so many genomes have been sequenced that imputation requires just a handful of the closest genealogical neighbors, which is where \xe2\x80\x9csurrogate parent\xe2\x80\x9d methods, like the one developed by Kong et al. (2008), will take hold. Until that point is reached, we suggest that our surrogate family approximation will remain an attractive way to balance accuracy and speed. Another technique for increasing the efficiency of imputation is called \xe2\x80\x9cpre-phasing.\xe2\x80\x9d The idea is to (pre-)phase the assayed genotypes in a GWAS dataset, then impute directly into the inferred haplotypes; this speeds up imputation by more than an order of magnitude at the cost of a small amount of accuracy (B. Howie and C. Fuchsberger, unpublished data). In principle, most imputation methods could use this approach, and researchers can already download implementations based on the IMPUTE2 and MaCH models (the MaCH implementation is called \xe2\x80\x9cminimac\xe2\x80\x9d). We have found that khap has similar accuracy characteristics in both unphased and pre-phased GWAS datasets (data not shown), so we view pre-phasing as being complementary to our surrogate family approximation: both approaches speed up imputation, and they can be used together for even greater efficiency. One potential extension of the results and methodology seen in this study is to whole-genome sequencing efforts like the 1000 Genomes Project. One study design that has arisen in this context is to sequence many individuals at low coverage; say, 2\xe2\x80\x934\xc3\x97. The data from this kind of experiment are too sparse to directly and confidently determine most genotypes, but they can be called with high accuracy by applying the same kinds of models that are used for genotype imputation in GWAS (Li et al. 2011; The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2010). We expect that the approach of combining information across populations will help call low-frequency alleles in that setting, much as it helped impute low-frequency alleles in this study.

We are studying a 181-bp PRE from the Drosophila engrailed gene. This PRE causes pairing-sensitive silencing of mini-white in transgenes. Here we show that the 181-bp PRE also represses mini-white expression in flies with only one copy of the transgene. To isolate mutations that alter the activity of the 181-bp PRE, we screened for dominant suppressors of PRE-mediated mini-white repression. Dominant suppressors of mini-white repression were rare; we recovered only nine mutations out of 68,274 progeny screened. Two of the nine mutations isolated are due to the same single amino acid change in the transcriptional activator Woc (without children). Reversion experiments show that these are dominant gain-of-function mutations in woc. We suggest that Woc can interfere with the activity of the PRE. Our data have implications for how Polycomb group proteins act to either partially repress or completely silence their target genes.Polycomb group genes (PcG) encode proteins that mediate transcriptional repression. First identified in Drosophila as genes necessary to maintain the silencing of homeotic genes, it is now evident that PcG proteins have many other targets (reviewed in Simon and Kingston 2009). Genome-wide studies show that the PcG repressive mark H3K27me3 is associated with hundreds of genes in single cell types and that targets can be cell-type specific (reviewed in Schwartz and Pirrotta 2008). Although it is evident that PcG proteins can decrease expression levels in addition to completely silencing expression, it is not clear what determines whether a gene will be completely or only partially repressed. In Drosophila, PcG proteins are associated with Polycomb group response elements (PRE), DNA elements that recruit PcG proteins to the DNA (reviewed in M\xc3\xbcller and Kassis 2006; Ringrose and Paro 2007). In genome-wide studies, PREs were identified as binding sites for multiple PcG proteins (Schwartz et al. 2006; N\xc3\xa9gre et al. 2006; Tolhuis et al. 2006). Two functional assays have also been used to identify PREs. In one assay, the PRE is combined in a transgene with regulatory DNA from a gene normally regulated by PcG proteins, where the PRE is required to maintain the \xe2\x80\x9coff\xe2\x80\x9d transcriptional state (M\xc3\xbcller and Bienz 1991; Hagstrom et al. 1997). In the other assay, PREs are used to repress expression of the mini-white reporter gene in transgenic flies. Because mini-white repression is stronger in flies homozygous for the PRE-mini-white reporter, this latter assay has been called pairing-sensitive silencing (Kassis 1994). One of the puzzles of the transgene assays for PREs is that silencing does not occur at every chromosomal insertion site. For example, for the four engrailed and invected PREs, pairing-sensitive silencing was observed at a frequency of 21\xe2\x80\x9362% of insertion sites (Americo et al. 2002; Cunningham et al. 2010). PRE activity is regulated by the expression state of the gene it regulates; thus it follows that PRE activity in transgenes is dependent on the activity of regulatory elements that flank the transgene insertion site. We have been studying a 181-bp en DNA fragment that acts as a PRE in several different assays: (1) it represses inappropriate expression in both en- and Ubx-reporter genes in embryos (Americo et al. 2002; Devido et al. 2008); (2) PcG proteins are associated with it in tissue culture cells, embryos, larvae, and adults (Strutt and Paro 1997; N\xc3\xa9gre et al. 2006; Oktaba et al. 2008); and (3) it acts as a pairing-sensitive silencing element (Kassis 1994). This fragment contains binding sites for the PRE DNA binding proteins Pho, Pho-like, GAGA factor, and Spps (Americo et al. 2002; Brown et al. 2005; Brown and Kassis 2010). Thus, the 181-bp DNA fragment is clearly a PRE. Therefore, we reasoned that conducting a genetic screen for mutations that alter the activity of this PRE might yield mutations in PcG genes. We conducted a genetic screen for dominant suppressors of pairing-sensitive silencing by a transgene that contained the 181-bp en PRE and mini-white. These mutations were rare; we only obtained nine suppressors among 68,274 genomes screened. None of the mutations affected mini-white repression of transgenes at all chromosomal insertion sites. This suggests that none of the mutations affects PRE activity directly. Instead, we believe that these mutations affect the expression of genes flanking the transgene insertion site. Consistent with this, two of the dominant suppressors are the same gain-of-function mutation in the gene without children (woc), which encodes a transcriptional activator. Our data suggest that there is a competition between transcriptional activators and PcG repression and that certain types of activators may be better able to overcome PcG repression.'","b'Polycomb group response elements (PRE) are cis-regulatory elements that bind Polycomb group proteins.

For EMS mutagenesis, adult males were fed EMS as described (Lewis and Bacher 1968; Kennison 1983), and then discarded 3\xe2\x80\x934 days following treatment to avoid pre-meiotic clusters of mutations. For the X-ray mutagenesis, males were irradiated with 30\xe2\x80\x9340 Gy at 120 keV using a Faxitron Torrex 2800. The irradiated males were discarded 4\xe2\x80\x935 days following treatment. DNA was isolated from homozygous or hemizygous mutant adults or larvae, and the entire woc transcription unit was sequenced. The 181-bp en PRE was amplified with the primers GCGGAATTCGAGATGGCATGTGGCTCT and GCGGAATTCGCATGCTGGAGCTGTCAG, cut with EcoRI, and cloned into EcoRI cut, phosphatased EK710, which contains loxP sites on both sides of the EcoRI site (Kuhn et al. 2004). A fragment of DNA containing the 181-bp PRE and flanking loxP sites was cut with NotI and cloned into NotI cut CaSpeR4. The resulting clone was sequenced to determine the orientation of the insert. P[L181PRE] was injected into homozygous Df(1)w67c23, y embryos using standard techniques. Some lines were generated by P-element mobilization by crossing to a strain with the endogenous transposase insertion P[ry+\xe2\x88\x862, 3]99B (Robertson et al. 1988). P[L] derivative lines lacking the en181bp-PRE were obtained by crossing males with the P[L181PRE] insertion to virgin females that carried a constitutively active Cre recombinase transgene (y1w; CyO, P[Crew]/Sco) (Siegal and Hartl 1996). Progeny that contained both P[L181PRE] and CyO, P[w+Cre] were crossed to Df(1)w67c23, y flies. Two individual w+ male progeny were selected from each insertion line and crossed to the appropriate balancer chromosome. P[L] lines were established, and the deletion of the en181bp-PRE was confirmed by PCR with primers flanking the loxP sites. Flies of the following genotypes were used: (1) w1118, (2) w1118; P[181PRE]8-10C, (3) w1118; wocD1, and (4) w1118;P[181PRE]8-10C; wocD1. Total RNA from 3rd instar larvae, 1-day-old pupae, or adult fly heads was prepared (Lorenz et al. 1989) and treated with DNase I before use. qRT-PCR was done with the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) on the LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche Applied Sciences) using 0.2 \xce\xbcg total RNA/reaction. The following PCR primers were used: for the RpL32 reference gene, CGGATCGATATGCTAAGCTGT and CGACGCACTCTGTTGTCG, its amplicon is 67 bp; for CG30456, AAAATGCGCAACGATTTCC and AACTTGCCCACCAAATGCT, its amplicon is 95 bp; for GstS1, GTCAAGGACAACGATGGTCA and GGTGATGCCTGCGAAGTAG, its amplicon is 72 bp. Reverse transcription was done at 50\xc2\xb0 for 20 min, followed by incubation at 95\xc2\xb0 for 15 min to activate the PCR reaction. PCR was for 45 cycles of 94\xc2\xb0, 10\xe2\x80\xb3, 60\xc2\xb0 20\xe2\x80\xb3, 72\xc2\xb0, 20\xe2\x80\xb3. After PCR, the reactions were heated to 95\xc2\xb0 and then cooled to 40\xc2\xb0 to analyze the melting temperatures of the PCR products. To recover mutations that affect pairing-sensitive silencing, we screened for dominant mutations that suppressed en181bp-mediated mini-white repression. We used the line P[181PRE]8-10C, which contains a P-construct with the 181-bp PRE of en DNA cloned into pCaSpeR (Construct 8 in Kassis 1994; Figure 1). pCaSpeR contains the mini-white gene; a truncated version of the white gene, which contains a promoter fragment that gives expression in the eye but no eye enhancer. The 181-bp PRE is cloned directly adjacent to the mini-white promoter. The w; P[181PRE]8-10C homozygotes have white eyes, and w; P[181PRE]8-10C heterozygotes have orange eyes (Figure 2). For the mutagenesis, we fed w; P[181PRE]8-10C males EMS and crossed to either w; P[181PRE]8-10C or w; P[181PRE]8-10C Sco/CyO females. We looked for mutations that darkened the eye color of either homozygotes or heterozygotes. We recovered nine mutations; one on the X chromosome, four on chromosome 2, and four on chromosome 3. All but two of the mutations darkened the eye color of both P[181PRE]8-10C homozygotes and heterozygotes. These mutations could identify genes involved in repression of mini-white transcription, perhaps via the PRE. One second-chromosome mutation darkened the eye color of heterozygotes only, which suggests that it is not involved in mini-white repression but might be involved in pigmentation. We did not study this mutation further. The sex-linked mutation only darkens the eye color of P[181PRE]8-10C homozygotes. The reason for this is unknown; however, it could mean that the mutation affects the interaction between PREs. P[181PRE]8-10C construct and location in genome. 181-bp en PRE (red box) is inserted upstream of the mini-white (m+mC) gene in P[181PRE]. P[181PRE]8-10C is inserted between CG30456 and GstS1. The 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends of the GstS1 and CG30456 transcription units are shown by the horizontal arrows. Vertical arrows indicate the insertion site of the EP element in P[EP]2185 and the approximate location of a cluster of six P[lacW] insertions located within 253 bp of each other near the GstS1 transcription start site. The insertion site of P[181PRE]8-10C is 2R:12989447, 925bp 5\xe2\x80\xb2 of the CG30456-RB transcription start site and 4512 bp from the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of GstS1-RA. Eye colors of P[181PRE]8-10C flies in wildtype and wocD1 mutants. Pictures are of eyes of 1-day-old females. All flies were w1118/w1118, and either homozygous or heterozygous for the P[181PRE]8-10C insertion (designated by 8-10C in the figure) and wocD1 as indicated. We mapped the mutations on chromosome 3 using the markers ru, h, th, cu, sr, es, and Pr. Two mutations mapped 2.5 map units distal to Pr. We next tried to recover recombinants between these two mutations. We found no recombinants among 448 progeny, suggesting that the two mutations are very close to each other and might be allelic. We tested whether several overlapping deletions for polytene chromosome region 96F\xe2\x80\x9398B (which should include the mutations) caused a darkening of the P[181PRE]8-10C heterozygous eye color. As none did, we suspected that both mutations are gain-of-function alleles that produce proteins with altered activities. If so, then a mutation that inactivates the mutant protein should revert the dominant suppression of the P[181PRE]8-10C eye color. Therefore, we tried to revert both mutations. We used both X-rays and EMS to generate revertants. We recovered three X-ray-induced revertants (from 24,758 progeny) and four EMS-induced revertants (from 5500 progeny). The revertants are lethal over deficiencies for the region 96F1\xe2\x80\x9398A5. By crossing to overlapping deficiencies and lethals in the region, we found that all of the revertants are lethal or semilethal mutations in the gene woc. Sequencing of the woc gene from our original suppressor mutation chromosomes showed that both of these mutations are due to the same single amino acid change in a position evolutionarily conserved throughout the Drosophila lineage, as well as in most insects (Figure 3). This amino acid change occurs in a region of the protein with no known domain or function. We named the two original suppressor mutations wocD1 and wocD2 (for wocDominant1 and wocDominant2), and we named the revertant alleles based on the allele reverted and the mutagen used (i.e., wocD1rvE8 was a revertant (rv) generated from wocD1 by EMS (E) mutagenesis). The wocD1/+ and wocD2/+ flies have no phenotypic defects. The wocD1 and wocD2 homozygotes survive, are fertile, and also show no phenotypic defects. Mutations in the woc gene generated in this study. The Woc protein is depicted by the rectangle with identified domains indicated. The location of the dominant suppressors wocD1 and wocD2 is highlighted in red. The mutations present in the revertants are shown. \xe2\x88\x86 indicates a deletion of four amino acids in wocD2rvX1. In wocD2rvX10, amino acid numbers 1605-1614 are deleted. We also sequenced the revertants. As expected, all revertants contained the mutation present in wocD1 and wocD2, as well as an additional lesion in the woc transcription unit (Figure 3). With the exception of wocD2rvX1, all of the mutants were lethal when heterozygous with all other woc mutants. The wocD2rvX1, which contains a four amino acid deletion in the sixth zinc finger, is a hypomorphic allele. The wocD2rvX1 survives poorly in combination with the other hypomorphic woc alleles, wocrgl and woc468. Transheterozygous wocD2rvX1/wocrgl and wocD2rvX1/woc468 flies have multiple phenotypic defects, including downturned wings, lack of wing veins, slightly rough eyes, and they are sterile. P[181PRE]8-10C is inserted in the genome between the genes GstS1 and CG30456 (Figure 1). We wanted to know whether wocD modulates the PRE directly or whether it acts through regulatory DNA flanking the insertion site of P[181PRE]8-10C. Importantly, wocD does not darken the eye color of wa, a mutation in the w gene that reduces the amount of w transcript and leads to orange eyes (Pirrotta and Br\xc3\xb6ckl 1984; Levis et al. 1984). This shows that wocD does not darken eye color indiscriminately. We examined whether the eye colors of flies heterozygous for other mini-white containing transgenes inserted near GstS1 were altered by wocD. We used a line with a P[EP] element inserted about 1.2 kb away from the insertion site of P[181PRE]8-10C and six lines with a P[lacW] inserted in the promoter region of GstS1 (Figure 1). The eye colors of P[lacW] or P[EP]/+; +/TM6C were compared with the eye colors of P[lacW] or P[EP]/+; wocD1/+ flies; no eye color differences were observed. This suggests that the effect of wocD on the eye color of P[181PRE]8-10C flies is dependent on the presence of the PRE in the transgene. We next examined whether wocD could alter the eye color of flies with P[181PRE] inserted at different chromosomal locations. We used the transgene P[L181PRE], which contains the same 181-PRE as in P[181PRE]8-10C. In P[L181PRE], the 181-bp PRE is flanked by loxP sites (see below). Because wocD dominantly alters the eye color of P[181PRE]8-10C heterozygotes, we looked at whether wocD could dominantly alter the eye color of flies heterozygous for P[L181PRE] insertions that show mini-white repression. For 14 out of 15 P[L181PRE] lines tested, wocD does not alter the eye color. However, in P[L181PRE]-8A, the eye color was slightly darker in a wocD mutant (data not shown). P[L181PRE]-8A is inserted just upstream of the PcG-regulated gene CycA (at 3L:11826614). To determine whether the effect on the eye color of P[L181PRE]-8A flies was due to the PRE, we examined the eye color of P[L]-8A flies in which the 181-bp PRE had been removed. We found that wocD had no effect on the eye color of flies that lacked the PRE. This shows that, at least at this chromosomal location, the change in eye color mediated by wocD is dependent on the PRE. However, as wocD does not influence the eye color of most P[L181PRE] lines, we believe that wocD is not working on the PRE directly but on sequences flanking the P[181PRE] insertion sites. We examined whether the levels of GstS1 and CG30456 transcripts were altered in wocD1 mutants, both in the presence and in the absence of the P[181PRE]8-10C insertion. We examined RNA levels at three developmental stages: 3rd instar larvae, 1-day-old pupae, and adult heads. We saw no significant differences in the expression levels of GstS1 and CG30456 between wocD1 and wild-type 3rd instar larvae or one-day old pupae (data not shown). However, we saw a twofold increase in the level of GstS1-RNA in the adult heads of homozygous wocD1 mutants compared to wild-type (Figure 4). Flies with the P[181PRE]8-10C insert had about a twofold decrease in the expression levels of CG30456 at all developmental stages, suggesting that the insertion interferes with the transcription of CG30456 (Figure 4 and data not shown). However, wocD1 had no significant effect on the transcription level of CG30456 at any developmental stage either in wild-type or in P[181PRE]8-10C animals (Figure 4 and data not shown). We also examined GstS1 and CG30456 transcript levels in eye-antennal disks from third instar larvae of wild-type and wocD1 mutants with P[181PRE]8-10C and saw no significant differences (data not shown). Finally, we tested whether wocD altered the transcription level of CycA in adult heads. We saw no significant differences in CycA levels between wild-type and wocD1; P[181PRE] heads (data not shown). The wocD1 mutation increases the amount of GstS1 transcript in adult heads. Graph shows the concentration ratio of GstS1 and CG30456 RNA to RpL32 RNA in fly heads (by qRT-PCR). The symbol 8-10C refers to P[181PRE]8-10C. Comparisons were made between wild type and wocD1 homozygotes, in flies homozygous for P[181PRE]8-10C or lacking it entirely. wocD1 increased the amount of GstS1 RNA about 2-fold regardless of whether P[181PRE]8-10C was present. wocD1 has no significant effect on CG30456 RNA levels. Results of three independent experiments are combined and SEM is shown. *P \xe2\x89\xa4 0.05; **P \xe2\x89\xa4 0.01; ns = not significant as determined by unpaired t-tests. We tested whether four of our other dominant suppressors of pairing-sensitive silencing of P[181PRE]8-10C effect the expression levels of GstS1 or CG30465 in fly heads by qRT-PCR; we saw no effect on transcript levels of either gene (data not shown). Thus, a change in transcription level of a GstS1 is not required for suppression of the pairing-sensitive silencing of P[181PRE]8-10C. Finally, we examined the effects of three the other suppressor mutants on the eye color of P[L181PRE] at multiple insertion sites. Like wocD, none of the other suppressor mutations altered the eye color of P[L181PRE] at the insertion sites. We flanked the 181-bp PRE by loxP sites and cloned it upstream of the mini-white reporter in pCaSpeR (P[L181PRE]), in the same orientation and position as in the construct P[181PRE] (Figure 5). We recovered 32 lines with insertions of P[L181PRE]. Of the 25 insertion lines that were homozygous viable, 15 exhibited pairing-sensitive silencing (60%). All lines were treated with Cre recombinase to excise the 181-bp PRE, yielding P[L]. None of the lines without the PRE showed pairing-sensitive silencing. In 7 of the 15 pairing-sensitive lines, the eye color of heterozygous flies became darker upon removal of the PRE, showing that some repression of mini-white expression occurred even in the heterozygotes (Figure 5). In contrast, in the lines that did not show pairing-sensitive silencing, the eye colors of flies heterozygous or homozygous for P[L181PRE] did not change after removal of the PRE, with one exception. In line P[L181PRE]11A, the eye color was slightly lighter after removal of the PRE, suggesting that this element was acting as a slight activator of mini-white expression at this location. This result is consistent with earlier evidence that showed that the 181-bp fragment, in the context of a reporter gene driven by the en promoter, can act as either an activator or repressor of gene expression depending on the context (Devido et al. 2008). This activation activity was weak and only occurred in 1 line out of 32. This shows that, in the mini-white assay, PRE-mediated repression is the usual situation. P[L181PRE] construct and eye colors. (A) P[L181PRE] is identical to P[181PRE] except the 181-bp en PRE is flanked by loxP sites (L). PSS is the number of lines with pairing-sensitive silencing/the total number of viable lines obtained. (B) Eyes from 2-day-old males of lines P[L181PRE]C2A (L181) and P[L]C2A (L) are shown. Note that the P[L]/+ eyes are darker than the P[L181PRE]/+ eyes. We determined the chromosomal insertion site for 26 of the P[L181PRE] lines (9 lines were lost prior to this part of the analysis) and examined whether the insertion occurred in or near a transcription unit (Table 1). We also examined whether the nearby gene is transcribed in the eye. We note that lines with pairing-sensitive silencing were just as likely to be inserted in or near genes transcribed in the eye as lines without it. Thus, insertion near a gene that is transcribed does not interfere with pairing-sensitive silencing. To gain insight into the mechanism of pairing-sensitive silencing mediated by the 181-bp en PRE, we conducted a genetic screen for dominant mutations that affected mini-white repression by that element. Notably, we obtained only nine mutations from screening 68,274 progeny. This low frequency of mutation recovery suggests that loss-of-function alleles were not obtained in our screen. If the loss of one copy of a gene could affect mini-white repression, these mutations would have been much more frequent. Our data suggest that mini-white repression by the 181-bp PRE is not dependent on genes that are dosage sensitive. The classical Polycomb group mutant phenotype is the presence of sex comb teeth on the second and third legs, caused by derepression of the Sex combs reduced (Scr) HOX gene (reviewed in Kennison 1995). Scr repression is sensitive to the dose of some PcG genes, as flies with only one wild-type copy have sex comb teeth on the second and third legs. In contrast, mini-white repression via the en 181bp PRE is not sensitive to a reduction in dosage of the PcG genes (Kassis 1994 and unpublished data). The 181-bp PRE is known to bind PcG proteins, and a binding site for the DNA-binding PcG group protein Pho is required for 181-bp\xe2\x80\x93mediated mini-white repression (Brown et al. 1998). Thus, we believe that PcG proteins mediate en PRE mini-white repression, but that this target of PcG proteins is not dosage sensitive. Heterozygosity for either wocD1 or wocD2 darkens the eye colors of P[181PRE]8-10C flies, whereas heterozygosity of woc deletions does not. This shows that wocD1 and wocD2 have acquired new activities and are gain-of-function alleles. Our results also show that wild-type Woc protein competes with WocD protein. This is suggested by the observation that P[181PRE]8-10C/P[181PRE]8-10C; wocD/woc\xe2\x88\x92 flies have a darker eye color than P[181PRE]8-10C/P[181PRE]8-10C; wocD/+ flies. Finally, the observation that the activity of WocD is abrogated by mutations that inactivate the Woc protein shows that the wocD mutation alters the activity of the protein. The woc gene encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor implicated in transcriptional activation (Wismar et al. 2000; Raffa et al. 2005) that acts, at least in part, through an association with HP1c (Font-Burgada et al. 2008; Able et al. 2009). There are five HP1 isoforms in Drosophila. Of these, HP1a is the best studied and is associated with heterochromatic DNA. In contrast, HP1c is excluded from centromeric heterochromatin and is associated with euchromatin. As stated above wocD suppresses mini-white expression from P[181PRE] in a position-dependent manner. Therefore, we wanted to know whether Woc binds to the genomic regions near the P[181PRE] insertion sites it regulates. We were not able to obtain Woc antisera, and there is no published data showing where Woc binds in the genome. However, the Drosophila ModENCODE project has mapped the binding sites of HP1c in four different cell culture lines by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to tiling arrays (Kharchendo et al. 2010). Because Woc is often associated with HP1c, we examined whether there was a correlation between HP1c binding and the suppressor activity of wocD. HP1c is bound in a cell-type\xe2\x80\x93specific manner. There is no HP1c associated with the region between GstS1 and CG30456 in S2, Kc167, or BG3 cells; however, HP1c is bound to this region in clone 8 cells. HP1c is not associated with CycA in any cell type. There is no data on HP1c localization in the pigment cells in the eye, so we cannot make any conclusion about whether WocD acts via HP1c in suppressing the PRE activity of P[181PRE]8-10C. How does wocD affect the eye color of P[181PRE]8-10C? We suggest that the eye colors of P[181PRE]8-10C flies result from a competition of transcriptional repression (caused by the PRE) and transcriptional activation of GstS1 (Figure 6). In the wild-type case, we suggest there is a competition between transcriptional activation of mini-white by flanking regulatory DNA and transcriptional repression mediated by the PRE, leading to an intermediate eye color. One prediction of this model is that if Woc levels are decreased, the PRE upstream of mini-white should be able to work more strongly, and the eye color should be lighter. Consistent with this hypothesis, the eye color of P[181PRE]8-10C/+; wocrgl/wocD2X1 flies is white (Figure 6). We suggest that the PRE in line P[181PRE]8-10C modulates the levels of mini-white expression in part through a competition with flanking activators. Interplay between Woc and PcG activity determines the eye colors of P[181PRE]8-10C flies. Genomic DNA around the P[181PRE]8-10C insertion site is denoted by the black line. The CG30456, GstS1, and w+mC promoters are designated by arrows pointing in the direction of transcription, with the height of the arrow indicating the relative level of transcription. The P-element ends (black rectangles), the 181-bp en PRE (red box), and the extent of the P[181PRE] transgene (red line at bottom) are shown. Green ovals indicate Woc activity, with WocD a bigger shape to indicate a higher activity. (Note that we have no evidence that Woc binds directly to this location.) PcG proteins are represented by orange ovals, with the level of repression indicated by the size of the oval. Eyes from flies of the genotype (A) w1118; P[181PRE]8-10C/+ (B) w1118; P[181PRE]8-10C/+; wocD1/+ (C) w1118; P[181PRE]8-10C/+; wocD2rvX1/wocrgl are shown on the right. WocHYP indicates a hypomorphic allelic combination. We were not able to obtain enough wocHYP adults to perform qRT-PCR, so we do not know the level of CG30456 and GstS1 RNA in these flies. This uncertainty is indicated by the question mark next to the transcription arrows in (C). PREs have been studied for many years as silencers of homeotic gene expression in Drosophila. Recent genome-wide studies showed that PREs may play an important role in regulating gene expression levels as well. What determines whether a PRE will completely silence a gene or only decrease its expression levels? Our data suggests two things. First, the number of PREs is important. This is evident from the fact that flies homozygous for PRE-mini-white constructs, which have two PREs, repress mini-white to a much higher level than flies heterozygous. We also note that increasing the number of PREs in cis, by duplicating a P-construct with PREs, also causes an increase in mini-white repression (Kassis 1994). Second, changes in the chromatin environment, here caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the transcriptional activator Woc, can inactivate a PRE. The dependence of PRE activity in transgenes on chromosomal environment has long been recognized and is dramatically demonstrated in a recent report showing the effect of chromosome environment on the activities of the Abd-B Fab-7 PRE and the vg PRE (Okulski et al. 2011). The relationship between transcriptional activation and PRE function is not simple. Addition of an enhancer containing three binding sites for the eye enhancer-activator protein Glass (GBS) to pCaSpeR darkens the eye color of transformants that contain an en PRE (Americo et al. 2002). If the increased transcription driven by the GBS enhancer interferes with PRE activity, one would expect to see a decrease in the number of lines with pairing-sensitive silencing in this vector. However, this did not occur. Thus, increasing the transcription of mini-white itself does not alter PRE activity. In addition, we found that insertion of P[L181PRE] into or next to genes expressed in the eye did not prevent pairing-sensitive silencing from occurring (Table 1). Therefore, we propose that it is not transcriptional activation but the actual activators present that determine whether a PRE is active or not. It has previously been suggested that PREs are general silencer elements that could act on any enhancer (Sengupta et al. 2004). The basis for this conclusion was that the Ubx PRE could act as silencers of three enhancers in reporter genes [two vestigal (vg) and one decapentaplegic (dpp) enhancer]. At that time, neither vg nor dpp was thought to be regulated by PcG proteins. However, since then, a vg PRE and a dpp PRE have been identified (Lee et al. 2005; Hauenschild et al. 2008; Okulski et al. 2011). We suggest that PREs may not be able to silence all enhancers, and in some chromosomal locations, they cannot act. It was recently reported that a human tissue\xe2\x80\x93specific enhancer functions in erythroid cells by evicting PcG proteins (Vernimmen et al. 2011). Enhancers with this activity may also be present in Drosophila. We thank Pamela Geyer and Emily Kuhn for the EK710 plasmid and the Cre recombinase flies; Mike Goldberg and Rick Padgett for woc mutants; Sarah DeVido for making the P[L181PRE] clone and for localization of many of the insertion sites; and Kristofor Langlais for statistical analysis of the qRT-PCR data.

8,"['Anders Eriksson', 'Andrea Manica']","November 4, 2011.",Detecting and Removing Ascertainment Bias in Microsatellites from the HGDP-CEPH Panel,"b'Although ascertainment bias in single nucleotide polymorphisms is a well-known problem, it is generally accepted that microsatellites have mutation rates too high for bias to be a concern. Here, we analyze in detail the large set of microsatellites typed for the Human Genetic Diversity Panel (HGDP)-CEPH panel. We develop a novel framework based on rarefaction to compare heterozygosity across markers with different mutation rates. We find that, whereas di- and tri-nucleotides show similar patterns of within- and between-population heterozygosity, tetra-nucleotides are inconsistent with the other two motifs. In addition, di- and tri-nucleotides are consistent with 16 unbiased tetra-nucleotide markers, whereas the HPGP-CEPH tetra-nucleotides are significantly different. This discrepancy is due to the HGDP-CEPH tetra-nucleotides being too homogeneous across Eurasia, even after their slower mutation rate is taken into account by rarefying the other markers. The most likely explanation for this pattern is ascertainment bias. We strongly advocate the exclusion of tetra-nucleotides from future population genetics analysis of this dataset, and we argue that other microsatellite datasets should be investigated for the presence of bias using the approach outlined in this article.The rapidly decreasing cost of high-throughput genotyping means that large datasets with both detailed genetic coverage and wide geographic scope are finally a reality (e.g., Li et al. 2008; Novembre et al. 2008; Jakobsson et al. 2008). These datasets provide fantastic opportunities to investigate human historical demography, and they promise to allow us to unravel the relative role of mutation, drift, and selection in shaping human diversity. However, the sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) typed by current technologies were originally chosen to represent diversity within panels of narrow geographic scope (Tishkoff and Verrelli 2003; Carlson et al. 2003) and thus suffer strongly of ascertainment bias (Rogers and Jorde 1996; Kuhner et al. 2000; Wakeley et al. 2001; Akey et al. 2003; Bustamante et al. 2005), making their use problematic when reconstructing the past of human populations at a worldwide level. A key step in assessing the importance of ascertainment bias in affecting demographic reconstructions has been the comparison with similar analyses performed on microsatellites (also known as single-tandem repeats, STR). Ascertainment schemes have been argued to have little effect on these highly polymorphic markers (Bowcock et al. 1994; Rogers and Jorde 1996; Harpending and Rogers 2000), which are generally thought to provide an unbiased estimate of neutral variation; thus, they are used as a yardstick against which attempts to remove ascertainment bias from SNP are assessed. For example, when analyzing a dataset of 3024 SNPs from the Human Genetic Diversity Panel [HGDP-CEPH (Cann et al. 2002), arguably the most comprehensive dataset on human genetic diversity covering over 1000 individuals from 52 populations], Conrad et al. (2006) investigated how using differently sized windows to define haplotypes affected estimates of within-population heterozygosity and concluded that a window of 20 Kb provided the best estimates as it gave the tightest fit with similar estimates obtained from 783 STRs typed in the same populations. Later analyses of a larger number of SNPs from the same panel have kept comparing the STR data, validating a variety of approaches, such as investigations of isolation by distance using patterns of between-population diversity (FST) (Jakobsson et al. 2008), of decrease in within-population variability with increasing distance from Africa (Li et al. 2008), and of population clustering using STRUCTURE (Li et al. 2008; Jakobsson et al. 2008). The assumption that microsatellites are free of bias has been questioned by two studies looking at the HGDP-CEPH data (Ray et al. 2005; Foll and Gaggiotti 2006). Romero et al. (2009) failed to find a bias when comparing the full set of 783 STRs used in the HGDP-CEPH dataset with a set of 16 unbiased STRs discovered in a multiethnic panel; however, the small number of markers in the unbiased set limits the power of their analysis. Here, we look in detail for signs of ascertainment bias in the 783 STRs used in the HGDP-CEPH panel (Rosenberg 2006). Specifically, we compare results obtained using different statistical approaches applied to di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotides separately, as we would expect the effect of bias to depend on the different mutation rates found for markers with different motif lengths. As some inconsistencies in results using different motifs might be ascribed to their different sensitivity to demographic processes (such as bottlenecks) rather than ascertainment, we develop a metric that reflects the underlying gene genealogy, effectively providing a description of diversity that is unaffected by mutation rates. More specifically, we use a rarefaction framework to generate estimates of expected heterozygosity (both within and between populations) that are rescaled to a single reference mutation rate and, thus, are directly comparable from a statistical point of view. Using this novel framework, which removes the differential effect of demographic processes on markers with different mutation rates, we demonstrate that tetra-nucleotides are inconsistent with di- and tri-nucleotides, a likely sign of ascertainment bias.'","b'Although ascertainment bias in single nucleotide polymorphisms is a well-known problem, it is generally accepted that microsatellites have mutation rates too high for bias to be a concern.

Specifically, we compare results obtained using different statistical approaches applied to di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotides separately, as we would expect the effect of bias to depend on the different mutation rates found for markers with different motif lengths. As some inconsistencies in results using different motifs might be ascribed to their different sensitivity to demographic processes (such as bottlenecks) rather than ascertainment, we develop a metric that reflects the underlying gene genealogy, effectively providing a description of diversity that is unaffected by mutation rates. More specifically, we use a rarefaction framework to generate estimates of expected heterozygosity (both within and between populations) that are rescaled to a single reference mutation rate and, thus, are directly comparable from a statistical point of view. Using this novel framework, which removes the differential effect of demographic processes on markers with different mutation rates, we demonstrate that tetra-nucleotides are inconsistent with di- and tri-nucleotides, a likely sign of ascertainment bias. We first developed a simple approach to determine the motif length of microsatellite markers from their fragment lengths, providing an objective way of removing inconsistencies from the data prior to our analysis. All fragment lengths L at a given locus can be written in the form L = Lm n + \xce\xb3, where Lm is the length of the locus\xe2\x80\x99s repeat unit, n is the number of repeat units (plus an unknown offset from the flanking regions), and \xce\xb3 is an integer between zero and Lm \xe2\x88\x92 1 (the remainder of dividing L by Lm). For each locus, we are interested in obtaining a reliable estimate of Lm and \xce\xb3. The analysis, which is repeated for each locus, consists of three steps. First, Lm is determined by finding the shift (by 2, 3, 4, or 5 nucleotides) that maximizes the relative overlap , where fi is the frequency of allele i in the sample. Second, we calculate the remainder \xce\xb3 from dividing each allele length L by Lm. Ideally, there should be a unique value of \xce\xb3 obtained from all lengths L for a given locus. In reality, several loci have multiple values. Loci for which the most common value of \xce\xb3 exceeded 95% of the total count were cleaned by recoding individuals with at least one allele with an unusual offset as missing data for that locus (supporting information, Figure S1, A and B); loci with less than 95% estimates of \xce\xb3 with same value were excluded from future analysis as they deviate too strongly from the assumed model (Figure S1, C and D). For all clean loci, allele lengths were converted into repeat numbers as n = (L \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xb3)/Lm. A Matlab implementation of this procedure is available in File S1. We investigated the results obtained for different motif lengths from two types of statistical approaches: hierarchical clustering with STRUCTURE v. 2.2.3, (Pritchard et al. 2000) and pairwise population differentiation estimated as FST [calculated in Matlab v7.11 from the expected within- and between-population heterozygosities weighted according to sample size (Nei 1978)]. We would expect both clustering and FST patterns to be relatively robust to differences in mutation rates between the markers with different motif lengths (Haasl and Payseur 2011). Demographic processes such as bottlenecks might be sampled differently by markers with different mutation rates. Even the normalization of between- by within-population variability used when computing pairwise FST will not fully account for this effect. To be able to statistically compare markers with different mutation rates, we would ideally need a metric that reflects the underlying gene genealogy, effectively providing a description of diversity that is unaffected by mutation rates. To this end, we have developed a rarefaction framework to generate estimates of expected heterozygosity (both within and between populations) that are rescaled to a single reference mutation rate and, thus, are directly comparable from a statistical point of view. Heterozygosity, defined as the probability that two alleles sampled at random are identical, is a frequently used measure of genetic diversity. It is most commonly computed to estimate within-population diversity, but it can be equally applied to describe between-population differentiation. However, heterozygosity estimates from markers with different mutation rates cannot be compared directly and do not obey a simple scaling rule; how heterozygosity scales with mutation rate depends on the detailed shape of the underlying gene genealogy (and thus on the distribution of time to most recent common ancestor, TMRCA). To solve this problem, we analyze the more general question of how the distribution p(\xce\x94) of pairwise differences in repeat count, \xce\x94, depends on the mutation rate. The principle of our method is best understood by considering a single microsatellite locus with mutation rate \xce\xbc. What would p(\xce\x94) be if we had a lower mutation rate, \xce\xbc\xe2\x80\xb2? If we knew the underlying gene genealogy of locus in a sample, and the location of mutations on the gene genealogy, we could rarefy the mutations to the new mutation rate by randomly removing mutations such that on average a fraction \xce\xbc\xe2\x80\xb2/\xce\xbc of the mutations remains, and calculate the new p(\xce\x94) from the resulting genetic variation. This principle is illustrated in Figure 1, A and B, and the effect of mutation rarefaction on the distribution p(\xce\x94) is illustrated in Figure 1C. Illustration of the mutation rarefaction principle for a given locus. (A) The gene genealogy of the sample (solid lines) and the location of the mutations since the most recent common ancestor (red circles). (B) Randomly removing a fraction of the mutations (open circles) tends to reduce the heterozygosity observed the sample. However, the extent to which this happens depends on the location of the deleted mutations in the gene genealogy. (C) The effect of rarefaction on the distribution of difference D in repeat count between individuals, p(D), with MRCA 1000 generations ago. The blue and red curves show the distributions for mutation rates m1 = 0.01 and m2 = 0.006, respectively, and the red dots show the result of rarefaction of the blue distribution by a factor m2/m1 = 0.6 (using Equation 2). In reality, we can observe p(\xce\x94), but we do not know the underlying gene genealogy, how many mutations occurred, or where they are placed on the gene genealogy. Nevertheless, for large samples, it is possible to estimate the rarefied p(\xce\x94) from the observed distribution by implicitly removing a given fraction of the underlying mutations. Consider the characteristic function of the distribution p(\xce\x94), defined as Using the standard Stepwise Mutation Model [SMM, Kimura and Ohta (1975, 1978)], we can express this function in terms of the (unknown) distribution of TMRCA for pairs of individuals. In the SMM, each mutation leads to the addition or removal of single repeat units, with equal probability. Assuming a mutation occurs independently with rate \xce\xbc per generation, the difference \xce\x94 in repeat count for a given pair of individuals with t generations to the MRCA can be written as the sum of 2t independent random variables, which are \xe2\x88\x921, 0, or 1 with probability \xce\xbc/2, 1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbc, or \xce\xbc/2, respectively. As the characteristic function of the sum of two independent variables is the product of their characteristic functions, and each variable here has the characteristic function , the characteristic function of \xce\x94 is . For a sample of more than two individuals, we average the characteristic function over the distribution gt of pairwise time to MRCA in the sample:where  is a generating function for gt. Solving for \xcf\x89 as a function of z, one obtains As the underlying distribution of time to the MRCA is assumed to be independent of the mutation rate (because of neutrality), this expression holds for any mutation rate. Hence, for mutation rate \xce\xbc\xe2\x80\xb2, we have Writing  in terms of \xce\x94 gives an explicit expression for the rarefied distribution of \xce\x94 in terms of the original distribution: (1) From the characteristic function, we can obtain the probability of observing difference \xce\x94 in repeat counts between individuals, prarefied(\xce\x94), in the rarefied sample by taking an inverse Fourier transform: (2) Figure 1C illustrates the effect of rarefaction on p(\xce\x94). Finally, using this relation, we obtain the following scaling rule for heterozygosity: Mathematically, this method only works when going from larger to smaller mutation rates. This makes intuitive sense, because for \xce\xbc\xe2\x80\xb2 < \xce\xbc, the method is removing information, but going in the opposite direction would correspond to increasing the amount of information in the sample. This type of extrapolation is so unstable that it is useless for all practical purposes. Finally, as a sanity check, we verify that our scaling method obey the scaling relation , where V is the variance of the counts of repeat units, which is the standard method in SMM theory for calibrating the relative mutation rate of two markers [e.g., see Zhivotovsky et al. (2003) and references therein]. It is straightforward to show that this relation holds for the rarefaction method, using the Taylor expansion of Equation 1 around \xcf\x89 = 0. For the markers used in the HGDP-CEPH panel, only the mutation rate for di-nucleotides has been estimated directly from pedigree data [\xce\xbc2 = 1.52 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923, Zhivotovsky et al. (2000)], whereas mutation rates for tri- and tetra-nucleotides have to be estimated indirectly (we do not consider penta-nucleotides, as there are too few of them). As the scaling rule for heterozygosity depends only on the ratio of mutation rates (i.e., on the fraction of mutations kept in the rarefaction process), we can use it to find the best estimates of mutation rates in tri- and tetra- nucleotides. For example, if we want to estimate the mutation rate for tri-nucleotides, we can find the optimal rarefaction factor, k23 (i.e., \xce\xbc3/\xce\xbc2), that brings the within- and between-population heterozygosities of di-nucleotides closest to those of tri-nucleotides. The mutation rate estimate of tri-nucleotides is then \xce\xbc3 = k23\xce\xbc2. An additional estimate for tri-nucleotides can be obtained using tetra-nucleotides as a reference for scaling the mutation rate of di- and tri-nucleotides. Given the optimal rarefaction factors k24 (i.e., \xce\xbc4/\xce\xbc2) and k34 (i.e., \xce\xbc4/\xce\xbc3), we estimate the mutation rate of tri-nucleotides as \xce\xbc3 = \xce\xbc2k24/k34. To test whether the matrix of within- and between population heterozygosities of motifs with different lengths are consistent after scaling, we separately scaled di- and tri-nucleotide markers to match the HGDP-CEPH tetra-nucleotide markers (by minimizing mean-square difference of the heterozygosity matrices). To test whether the one-to-one relation can be significantly rejected, we estimated 95% confidence intervals of the regression lines (di- and tri-nucleotide heterozygosities versus tetra-nucleotide heterozygosities) from 10,000 bootstrap samples of the data using a Matlab script. We then repeated the same analysis comparing di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide heterozygosities to the heterozygosities of the unbiased tetra-nucleotide markers, after scaling to this set of markers. Finally, we analyzed the dependence of within-population expected heterozygosity and allelic richness [calculated using ADZE v.1.0 (Szpiech et al. 2008)] on the distance from sub-Saharan Africa [calculated as in (Manica et al. 2005)] for di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide markers. Especially, we analyzed the effect of subsetting the markers and scaling of heterozygosities on the cline in heterozygosity away from sub-Saharan Africa. Despite our strict demands for accepting a locus, our approach gave 749 markers (out of 783) that could be used for analysis, subdivided into 54 di-, 166 tri-, 519 tetra-, and 10 penta-nucleotides (Table S1). The 10 penta-nucleotide markers were dropped from further analysis because they were deemed too few. The cleaned data from the 749 markers [as well a cleaned version of the 16 unbiased markers from Romero et al. (2009)] are available (File S1 and File S2). For those markers that had been previously classified based on the reference Human Genome sequence (Pemberton et al. 2009), Pemberton et al. and our classifications were in agreement, with the exception of five markers (Table S2, File S3, and File S4). Analysis of di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotides with STRUCTURE yielded the same clusters irrespective of which motif length was used (Figure 2). However, when comparing FST patterns for these three categories of markers, we found a strong effect of marker length for FST patterns: di- and tri-nucleotides were in very good correspondence (Figure 3, A and B), but tetra-nucleotides showed much lower population differentiation than the shorter motifs (Figure 3C). To determine whether this discrepancy can be attributed to demographic processes being sampled differently by markers with dissimilar mutation rates, we apply our rarefaction approach to compute statistically comparable, rarefied heterozygosity estimates. Five-cluster STRUCTURE analysis of the HGDP-CEPH data, with populations ordered according to increasing distance from sub-Saharan Africa. The top panel shows the clusters of the original HGDP-CEPH dataset. The remaining panels show, from top to bottom, the respective clusters based on the di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotides in the cleaned HGDP-CEPH dataset. FST of cleaned HGDP-CEPH markers with different repeat motif lengths. The three panels show pairwise comparisons between FST values: (A) di- versus tri-nucleotides, (B) tri- versus tetra-nucleotides, and (C) di- versus tetra-nucleotides. To rarefy estimates of within- and between-population expected heterozygosity, we first use our scaling procedure to find the relative mutation rates of the different groups of markers (see Materials and Methods). Table 1 shows the result of estimating the mutation rates of di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotides, as well as a set of 16 unbiased tetra-nucleotides from Romero et al. (2009). Each row corresponds to using a given reference set of markers, and the columns contain the mutation estimates for different sets. In addition to fitting the within- and between-population heterozygosities, p(0), we show mutation rates calculated by fitting the distribution of count differences p(\xce\x94) and by scaling the variances (the approach used in previous articles). We find that the mutation rates obtained by rarefaction analysis are insensitive to which markers are used as reference and whether the fitting was based on the full distribution of differences, p(\xce\x94), or on only the heterozygosities, p(0). The scaling of variance, however, yields a slightly lower mutation rate for the tri-nucleotide loci (0.65 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923 versus 0.71 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923 \xe2\x80\x93 0.77 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923). There is also a mismatch for the mutation rate for the unbiased tetra-nucleotides (0.46 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923 versus 0.23 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923), but the small number of markers makes these estimates somewhat unreliable. For comparison, we also show the mutation rates found by Zhivotovsky et al. (2003), which are based on a subset of the CEPH-HGDP markers obtained by removing markers with extreme variances. Figure 4 shows pairwise comparisons of the rarefied within- and between-population average heterozygosities of HGDP-CEPH markers after fitting to the tetra-nucleotide markers (left panels) or unbiased tetra-nucleotide markers (right panels, together with lines indicating the one-to-one relationships and 95% confidence intervals of the regression lines. The di-, tri- and unbiased tetra-nucleotides are in good agreement (Figure 4, A, B, and D), whereas the HGDP-CEPH tetra-nucleotides are significantly different from all other groups (Figure 4, C, E, and F), consistent with patterns in FST (Figure 3). Pairwise comparisons of the scaled within- and between-population expected heterozygosities (red and blue dots, respectively). HGDP-CEPH markers are scaled to match the tetra-nucleotide markers (A, C, E) or unbiased tetra-nucleotide markers (B, D, F). In all panels, the solid black lines show the one-to-one relations, and the dashed black lines show the 95% confidence intervals of regression lines based on 10,000 bootstrap samples of the data. A, C, E: Comparisons of heterozygosities of di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide markers. B, D, F: comparisons of di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide to the unbiased markers. This discrepancy seems to be due to populations in Eurasia being relatively homogeneous for tetra-nucleotides. This effect can be visualized by plotting the decline in within-population genetic diversity with increasing distance from sub-Saharan Africa [a pattern attributed to the effect of sequential founder events during the spread out of Africa by anatomically modern humans (Prugnolle et al. 2005; Ramachandran et al. 2005; Manica et al. 2007)]. Irrespective of whether we look at raw estimates of expected within-population heterozygosity (Figure 5A) or at rarefied estimates using the approach outlined in this article (Figure 5B), it is clear that, whereas di- and tri-nucleotides show a smooth decline of heterozygosity with increasing distance from Africa, the heterozygosity of tetra-nucleotides is much flatter across Eurasia (corresponding to approximately 5,000\xe2\x80\x9315,000 km in Figure 5), with a steep decline evident only once we reach the Americas. A similar pattern holds for allelic richness (Figure S2). Within-population expected heterozygosity as a function of distance from sub-Saharan Africa for di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotides separately (blue, green, red symbols, respectively). Panels A and B show the heterozygosity before and after scaling to match the full tetra-nucleotide H-matrix, respectively (see Table 1 for the relative mutation rates). To what extend do tetra-nucleotides affect previous estimates of relationship between within-population heterozygosity and distance from sub-Saharan Africa? To answer this question, we estimated the relationship for three different averages: (i) of the complete set of markers for the HGDP-CEPH panel (i.e., pooling all di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotides and ignoring differences in mutation rates, as is commonly done when estimating within-population heterozygosity); (ii) of only the subset of di- and tri-nucleotides (i.e., pooling only the markers that were consistent with each other, again ignoring mutation rates); and (iii) of an estimate of the latter after rarefying the di-nucleotide to the mutation rate of tri-nucleotides (i.e., the correct way of combining markers with different mutation rates). As can be seen in Figure 6, the slope estimated for the full set of markers (\xe2\x88\x926.792\xc2\xb710\xe2\x88\x926 \xc2\xb1 4.277\xc2\xb710\xe2\x88\x927) is significantly shallower than that estimated for the subset of di- and tri-nucleotides (\xe2\x88\x928.866\xc2\xb710\xe2\x88\x926 \xc2\xb1 4.584\xc2\xb710\xe2\x88\x927; F1,98 = 10.94, P = 0.001) and for the rarefied dataset (\xe2\x88\x928.656\xc2\xb710\xe2\x88\x926 \xc2\xb1 4.498\xc2\xb710\xe2\x88\x927; F1,98 = 9.02, P = 0.003). The is no difference in the slope estimates for subsets of di- and tri-nucleotides and for the rarefied dataset (F1,98 = 0.11, P = 0.744), but as one would expect, the intercept is significantly lower for the latter (7.820\xc2\xb710\xe2\x88\x9201 \xc2\xb1 5.929\xc2\xb710\xe2\x88\x923 versus 7.958\xc2\xb710\xe2\x88\x921 \xc2\xb1 6.043\xc2\xb710\xe2\x88\x923; F1,99 = 6.92, P = 0.010). Average within-population heterozygosity for the CEPH-HGDP populations, as a function of distance from sub-Saharan Africa. Orange: Average of all cleaned markers. Red: Average of di- and tri-nucleotides. Black: Average of di- and tri-nucleotides, with di-nucleotides scaled down to the tri-nucleotides. Inset: Regression lines for the three colors. For reference, the scaled data are shown as gray. Our analyses clearly illustrates that, whereas di- and tri-nucleotides show patterns that are highly consistent with each other, the tetra-nucleotides originally typed for the HGDP-CEPH panel are inconsistent as they are too homogeneous in their individual distributions across Eurasia. This discrepancy cannot have arisen from demographic processes affecting markers with different mutation rates to different extents: rarefying diversity to the slowest mutation rate should always give equivalent estimates, as the underlying distribution of gene genealogies is the same irrespective of the marker of choice. Although this is true for di- and tri-nucleotides, for which both within and between-population heterozygosity estimates are equivalent after rarefaction, tetra-nucleotides remain inconsistent even when we consider rarefied estimates of heterozygosity. The most likely explanation for this discrepancy seems to be some form of bias in the choice of markers. We know that tetra-nucleotide markers included in the HGDP-CEPH panel show significantly higher diversity than the unbiased markers developed by Romero et al. (2009). The patterns observed in the data would be consistent with a scenario where the HGDP-CEPH tetra-nucleotides were selected for high diversity from a panel mostly composed by Eurasians. It is difficult to say whether di- and tri-nucleotides were selected from a broader panel (and thus there was little or no bias in their selection process) or whether they escaped the effect of bias because of their higher mutation rates (i.e., most markers have a diversity well above the threshold for selection). In any case, the discrepancy between different microsatellites of different motif lengths indicates that microsatellites are probably not as immune to ascertainment bias as suggested in the past (Rogers and Jorde 1996; Bowcock et al. 1994; Harpending and Rogers 2000). It is clear that the choice of metrics extracted from the markers is important, as some are more affected by bias than others are. In contrast to the heterozygosity-based measures, we found STRUCTURE clusters to be relatively robust to the bias affecting tetra-nucleotides. This result is consistent with simulation studies of microsatellites and STRs, showing that STRUCTURE is relatively robust against ascertainment bias (Haasl and Payseur 2011). Average heterozygosity is a commonly computed quantity, often used to parameterize population genetic models (Zhivotovsky et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2006; Deshpande et al. 2009). However, when the markers have heterogeneous mutation rates, this quantity does not correspond to the heterozygosity of the average mutation rate (or to any other single mutation rate). An important contribution of our article is the development of a rarefaction approach to combine markers with different mutation rates in heterozygosity-based measures corresponding to a single mutation rate. This approach allows all markers to carry equal weight in determining the overall metric, and is a much more accurate approach than simply averaging estimates obtained for different types of markers. Our approach is model free with respect to the underlying demographic processes (i.e., we do not explicitly reconstruct bottlenecks, migrations, etc.). It is important to note that to combine heterozygosities, we do not need to know the mutation rate of any of the types but only have an a priori classification scheme that allows us to group markers with relatively similar mutation rates. However, if the mutation rate of one of the marker types is known, rarefaction yields the mutation rate of the combined heterozygosities. This way of estimating mutation rates has the advantage to be relatively robust to the inclusion of markers with extreme values, a known weakness of the commonly used approach of scaling the variances (Zhivotovsky et al. 2003). Although we have not performed a formal investigation of the number of makers needed for our approach to be stable, we estimate our rarefaction method to require at least 10, and ideally over 20 markers in each group to avoid artifacts while rescaling. In the case of microsatellites, we obviously need markers to be clean enough to comply with the SMM framework. We provide several tools to check such compliance. The SMM model is the simplest and most widely used model of microsatellite evolution, but it may seem overly simplistic given the heterogeneous nature of human microsatellites (Chakraborty et al. 1997; Ellegren 2004). For example, the fact that the SMM model assumes symmetric mutation rates may seem to limit its validity for our method. However, our method uses only the pairwise difference in number of repeats between individuals and is, therefore, independent of any constant, directional bias in the mutations (toward higher or lower repeat counts). It is also possible to use our method with more complex models. In the appendix, we show how our method can be adapted to use mutation models with arbitrary length-dependent increment and decrement rates and for models in which multiple repeat units can sometimes be added or removed. The main conclusion from analyzing these models is that the scaling relation between rarefied and original distribution of repeat counts depends only on the ratio of the two mutation rates, and they can be used in the same way as the simple SMM model. Although in many cases, it is not possible to write the scaling relation in a closed form, it is straightforward to compute it numerically. For the case of constraining the SMM model to have repeat counts between one and L, we show in the appendix that the scaling relation is the same as in the standard SMM model. What are the implications of the bias in HGDP-CEPH tetra-nucleotides for studies that have used these markers to study the effect of SNP ascertainment bias? Conrad et al. (2006) plotted within-population haplotype heterozygosity against microsatellite heterozygosity for different haplotype lengths. Although SNPs were found to have little relation to microsatellites, they found that points fall on a curve for haplotypes at least 20 kb long (see Figure 3 in Conrad et al. 2006). If we were to remove the tetra-nucleotide markers from this plot, the American data points would be shifted strongly left, the Asian data points slightly so, and the remaining populations would be essentially unchanged (Figure 6). Although the resulting pattern would be slightly less linear, the points would still fall on a curve (because heterozygosity of microsatellites and SNPs depend differently on the underlying gene genealogies, the relation between the two is not linear in general). The conclusion that sufficiently long haplotypes are effectively free of ascertainment bias is not strongly affected by the bias in the tetra-nucleotides. Sun et al. (2009) found a linear relation between microsatellite average-squared difference (ASD) and sequence divergence for individuals from different populations. The bias observed in the tetra-nucleotides has little effect on ASD (unpublished) and, therefore, does not change any of their conclusions in that article. For models describing the expansion of anatomically modern humans out of Africa that have been parameterized using the average heterozygosity of all markers (e.g., Ramachandran et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2006; Deshpande et al. 2009), we would not expect the biases discussed in this article to put their main conclusions into doubt. On the other hand, we would expect the actual estimates of most parameters to be affected. This is especially true of the timing of the expansion out of Africa, which is usually the most interesting quantity. In addition, the relatively flat FST pattern from tetra-nucleotide markers (Figure 3), as well as the weaker cline in within-population expected heterozygosity (Figure 6), would cause such models to overestimate gene flow (migration) and und",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

restimate population bottlenecks during the expansion; the magnitude of these effects depends on the details of the models, but it is approximately proportional to the relative effect of the bias on FST and the trend in expected heterozygosity. The HGDP-CEPH panel has been used as a blueprint for the development of large datasets based on microsatellites, and subsets of the markers used in the HGDP-CEPH have been adopted for investigating genetic diversity in Africa (Tishkoff et al. 2009), India (Rosenberg et al. 2006), Oceania (Friedlaender et al. 2008), and the Americas (Wang et al. 2007). A simple precaution for future users of these datasets would be to limit their analysis to di- and tri-nucleotides. Although tetra-nucleotides constitute the majority of the markers in the HGDP-CEPH panel, di- and tri-nucleotides together still provide 220 markers, a very large number in terms of population genetics. Furthermore, our analyses above show that these markers are enough to perform all the type of analytical approaches usually employed on this type of data and, indeed, drive the results for measures such as H and FST when the data are combined. However, as several of these datasets concentrate on geographic areas at the boundaries of the coverage from the HGDP-CEPH panel, we would recommend following the same steps adopted in this article to investigate the presence of biases and make sure that they are fully removed. This work was supported by a Philip Leverhume Award and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Grant BB/H005854/1. Consider an extension of the standard SMM model to arbitrary jump distributions, such that at each mutation the probability of a change of k repeats is qk (with q0 = 0). The standard SMM model corresponds to taking q1= q-1= 1/2, and qk = 0 otherwise. Using the characteristic functionwe can write the characteristic function  for the difference \xce\x94 in repeat count between two alleles aswhere g(z) is the generating function for the distribution of the TMRCA. Expanding to the first order in \xc2\xb5, we obtainwhere Hence, for any small mutation rate \xc2\xb5,where  denotes the inverse function of G. Thus, for mutation rate \xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2, we express  in terms of : Finally, we can use the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the distribution of \xce\x94 at mutation rate \xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2 from . As for the standard SMM model, the scaling relation depends only on ratio of the two mutation rates, which means that our scaling method works equally well for these models. We also note that only the component of the jump distribution symmetric around k = 0 enters into the final expression. This is a consequence of the fact that we consider only differences in repeat count, and implies that the scaling relation is independent of any systematic increase or decrease in the repeat count. If the jump distribution is fully symmetric, the scaling relation is exact. Otherwise, there is a small correction to the scaling relation, but it is still possible to express  in terms of . However, when the mutation rates are small the correction is negligible. In this section, we consider the effect of limiting the SMM models to repeat counts in the range [1, L] (shifting the range with an arbitrary amount makes no difference to the analysis). At the ends of the interval, we introduce reflecting boundary conditions such that the stationary distribution is uniform over the range. For alleles with repeat count in the range [2, L-1], mutations occur independently each generation with probability \xc2\xb5, with equal probability of gaining or losing a single repeat unit. At repeat count one, only mutations leading to an increment are accepted, and the repeat count L only decrements are accepted. Starting from a distribution x at time zero, the distribution of p of alleles t generations later can be written on matrix form aswhere the matrix M has elements given by Mi,i = 1, Mi-1,i = Mi+1,i = \xe2\x88\x921/2, and Mi,j = 0 otherwise, except at the boundaries where M1,1 = ML,L = 1/2. Correspondingly, the joint distribution Pij for two individuals becomes (given that M is symmetric) (A1)where D denotes the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements equal to x. Because M is symmetric, all eigenvectors and eigenvalues are real-valued, and the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. Expanding M in the eigenvectors u\xce\xb1 and eigenvalues \xce\xbb\xce\xb1, we havewhere the superscript T denotes transpose. Inserting this in the equation for P above, and multiplying from the left and right with  and , respectively, gives If we now assume that the distribution of alleles in the MRCA of the two individuals is the stationary distribution (i.e., the locus is old enough), this equation simplifies towhere  is Kroenecker\xe2\x80\x99s delta, which is equal to one if  and is zero otherwise,  is a diagonal matrix. If we now consider an arbitrary distribution of TMRCA with generating function g(z), as in the previous section, we obtain Again, the function g(z) is independent of the mutation rate. Thus, this equation suggests a scaling relation  between the eigenvalues at mutation rate \xc2\xb5 and \xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\x99 for the same underlying distribution of TMRCA. The joint distribution of alleles for mutation rate \xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2, P(\xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2), can then written in terms of the diagonal elements :where  denotes the value of \xce\xb1 corresponding to \xce\xb1\xe2\x80\xb2 under the scaling relation. A problem with this view is that the scaled values of \xce\xb1 may not be an integer. In this case we can use that the underlying function g(z) is smooth: hence, if we sort the eigenvalues in increasing order, we can estimate  at non-integer \xce\xb1 using interpolation. For the L-SMM, the eigenvalues are Solving the scaling relation gives the correspondence Identifying the angular frequency , we see that this relation is identical to the scaling relation for the standard SMM model (see Equation 1). Indeed, since the homozygosity F is the sum of the diagonal of P, and this scalar is invariant under unitary matrix transformations, we can write F as  which is the direct correspondence to Equation 2 with \xce\x94 = 0. The analyses in the previous section can be extended to single-step mutation models (with finite number of states) where the probability of increment and decrement mutations can both have an arbitrary dependence on the number of repeats in the sequence. As in the preceding section, we will assume that the locus is old enough that the ancestral probability distribution is approximately equal to the stationary distribution (this is an assumption implicit in methods typically used in estimating length-dependent mutation rates). Our starting point is Equation A1 in the preceding section, where M is the (tri-diagonal) mutation matrix, and D the diagonal matrix corresponding to the stationary distribution. Here, M is generally not symmetric, but it is straightforward to verify that the matrix MD is (it follows directly from the condition for having a stationary distribution). Hence, we can use an approach similar to above using Inserting Equation A1, we obtain The matrix  is symmetric, as Hence, we can use the method from the previous section to relate  to the generating function g(z) of the TMRCA of the locus,where  are the eigenvalues of  (which are identical to those of M), and the value of , for 0 < \xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2 < \xc2\xb5, can again be found by interpolation from . Finally, the joint distribution of alleles at the lower mutation rate can be calculated usingwhere  are the eigenvectors of .

9,"['Joseph S. Boyd', 'Mary Rose Lamb', 'Carol L. Dieckmann']","November 4, 2011.",Miniature- and Multiple-Eyespot Loci in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Define New Modulators of Eyespot Photoreception and Assembly,"b'The photosensory eyespot of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model system for the study of organelle biogenesis and placement. Eyespot assembly and positioning are governed by several genetic loci that have been identified in forward genetic screens for phototaxis-defective mutants. These include the previously described miniature-eyespot mutant min1, the multiple-eyespot mutant mlt1, the eyeless mutants eye2 and eye3, and two previously uncharacterized eyespot mutants, min2 and mlt2. In this study, effects of miniature- and multiple-eyespot mutations and their combinations on the localization and expression levels of the rhodopsin photoreceptor channelrhodopsin-1 (ChR1) and the localization of the eyespot-assembly proteins EYE2 and EYE3 were examined. min2 mutants assemble a properly organized, albeit nonfunctional, eyespot that is slightly smaller than wild-type; however, combination of the min2 and mlt1 mutations resulted in drastic reduction of photoreceptor levels. Both stationary-phase mlt1 and mlt2 cells have supernumerary, mislocalized eyespots that exhibit partial or total dissociation of the eyespot layers. In these mutant strains, photoreceptor patches in the plasma membrane were never associated with pigment granule arrays in the chloroplast stroma unless EYE2 was present in the intervening envelope. The data suggest that MIN2 is required for the photoreceptive ability of the eyespot and that MLT2 plays a major role in regulating eyespot number, placement, and integrity.Sensory organelles, such as the primary cilium, are specialized for detection of external stimuli and often occupy defined positions within the cell to facilitate specific cellular responses (Pazour and Witman 2003; Bornens 2008). The eyespot of the biflagellate, unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an asymmetrically localized, photosensory organelle that mediates directional light perception and allows the cell to respond to varying light levels by either swimming toward a source of low-intensity light (positive phototaxis) or away from high-intensity light (negative phototaxis) (Witman 1993; Kreimer 1994, Hegemann 1997). Light-induced plasma membrane depolarization is sensed by Ca2+-responsive proteins, eliciting changes in the flagellar beat pattern and swimming orientation (Nultsch 1983; Kamiya and Witman 1984; Hegemann et al. 1990). The eyespot of C. reinhardtii brings together multiple cellular compartments, comprising components in both the chloroplast and plasma membrane as well as maintaining a characteristic association with the cytoplasmic cytoskeletal system. The eyespot, which in wild-type C. reinhardtii cells has an average diameter of one micrometer (Harris 1989), resides in a defined position in the cell in association with the daughter four-membered (D4) microtubule rootlet and is situated 45\xc2\xb0 from the plane of the flagella (Holmes and Dutcher 1989), an arrangement necessary for mediating proper photoresponses (Foster and Smyth 1980; Kamiya and Witman 1984). The C. reinhardtii eyespot is not inherited from the mother cell but forms anew each cell cycle (Holmes and Dutcher 1989). The eyespot comprises an average of 120 carotenoid-filled pigment granules (Melkonian and Robenek 1984) arranged in two to four layers in the chloroplast. The pigment granule arrays are stacked between layers of thylakoid membrane and are tightly apposed to the chloroplast envelope (Melkonian and Robenek 1984; Dieckmann 2003; Kreimer 2009) and appear as a distinct spot when viewed in the light microscope (see Figure 1A). The membranes in the eyespot region are highly specialized. The outer chloroplast envelope membrane is characterized by a high particle density observed by electron microscopy (Melkonian and Robenek 1980). Directly overlaying the pigment granule compartment is a particle-dense region of plasma membrane containing light-gated rhodopsin photoreceptors, channelrhodopsins 1 and 2 (ChR1 and ChR2) (Sineshchekov et al. 2002; Nagel et al. 2002; Nagel et al. 2003). The D4 rootlet is postulated to guide the photoreceptors to the site of eyespot assembly (Mittelmeier et al. 2011), where they form and maintain a stable association with eyespot proteins in the chloroplast envelope (Boyd et al. 2011a). Unraveling the mechanisms that unify disparate cellular elements into a single functional system such as the eyespot is a formidable challenge that has been assisted by forward genetic approaches. Mutations in C. reinhardtii have identified several loci required for eyespot biogenesis, structure, and positioning, including MIN1, EYE2, EYE3, and MLT1 (Lamb et al. 1999). Both the eye2 and eye3 mutants lack eyespots and are unable to phototax at low-light intensity. EYE2, a thioredoxin-family protein, localizes to the chloroplast envelope compartment of the eyespot, likely directing the site for assembly of the eyespot pigment granule arrays (Boyd et al. 2011a). The EYE3 protein is a ser/thr kinase of the ABC1 family localized to the eyespot pigment granules, and it is required for the biogenesis or stability of the granules (Boyd et al. 2011a). The min1 mutant possesses a miniature eyespot characterized by disorganized and nonmembrane-apposed pigment granules in the chloroplast stroma when grown in medium lacking acetate as a carbon source (Lamb et al. 1999; Boyd et al. 2011a). MIN1 is a C2/LysM-domain protein (Mittelmeier et al. 2008) present in the eyespot proteome (Schmidt et al. 2006). The mlt1 mutant has multiple eyespots that can form in either longitudinal hemisphere of the cell. The pigment granule arrays in eyespots of the mlt1 mutant appear structurally normal by electron microscopy (Lamb et al. 1999). The putative MLT1 protein is not predicted to possess a chloroplast-targeting sequence and has no functional domains or homology to other proteins in the databases (Boyd et al. 2011b). Although previous studies have revealed much information regarding the factors that govern the coordination of the eyespot-assembly process and regulate the structural aspects of eyespot formation, many remain to be identified. Here we report the characterization of two additional eyespot mutants, the miniature-eyespot mutant min2 and the multiple-eyespot mutant mlt2. Both the MIN2 and MLT2 loci map to existing clusters of eyespot-assembly genes and define novel factors that indicate the existence and integration of multiple processes in eyespot assembly and photoreceptive function.'","b'The photosensory eyespot of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model system for the study of organelle biogenesis and placement.

Both the MIN2 and MLT2 loci map to existing clusters of eyespot-assembly genes and define novel factors that indicate the existence and integration of multiple processes in eyespot assembly and photoreceptive function. Chlamydomonas strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii wild-type strains 137c mt+ (CC-125) and mt\xe2\x88\x92 (CC-124), were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Stock Center (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN). Strains min1-1 (CC-4305) and mlt1-1 (CC-4304) were originally obtained following UV-mutagenesis of strain 137c mt+ (Lamb et al. 1999). Strain min2-1 (59-1; CC-4318) was a spontaneous mutation isolated following mutagenesis of strain 137c mt+ with the CRY-1 insertion (Nelson et al. 1994). The mutation in min2-1 is unlinked to the insertion. Strains 33 (CC-4317) and mlt2-1 (2-8; CC-4320) were isolated following 5-fluorodeoxyuridine-induced mutagenesis of strain 137c mt+. Strains were maintained on solid tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium or TAP supplemented with 0.2 mg/mL arginine (for arginine auxotrophic strains). Liquid cultures were grown in modified Sager and Granick medium I with added Hutner\xe2\x80\x99s trace elements (R medium) or without acetate (M medium), or in M medium lacking nitrogen (M-N medium) (Harris 1989). Mutagenized Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains were screened using a simple assay for phototactic ability. Strains were patched on solid TAP medium plus arginine and inoculated into 1.2 mL liquid M-N medium in test tubes. Cultures were grown overnight at 25\xc2\xb0 and assayed for phototaxis by placement in a covered box with a narrow slit at the bottom for illumination. Phototaxis-defective (ptx\xe2\x88\x92) or nonswimming strains were observed by bright field microscopy. Fresh cultures from plates were grown for two days on solid R medium containing one-tenth of the normal nitrogen source at 25\xc2\xb0 under continuous illumination. Cells were inoculated into 1 mL M-N medium, incubated four hours at 25\xc2\xb0, and then 200 \xce\xbcL of each culture were combined and allowed to mate for one hour under continuous illumination at 25\xc2\xb0. Mating mixtures were plated on solid R medium containing 4% agar and kept in the dark for at least four days. Dissection and tetrad analysis were conducted according to standard methods (Harris 1989). For complementation and dominance tests, eyespot mutant strains containing the arg7-2 allele were mated to mutant strains containing the arg7-8 allele. Mating mixtures were plated on solid TAP medium, without arginine to select for diploids, which were then assayed for phototactic ability as described above. Cells from overnight liquid cultures were viewed according to the protocol described in Mittelmeier et al. (2008). Preparation of samples and immunofluorescence microscopy were carried out according to the protocol described in Mittelmeier et al. (2008), except antibodies against EYE2, EYE3, and ChR1 were directly conjugated to fluorophores (Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa 594, or allophycocyanin) using Zenon rabbit IgG\xe2\x80\x93labeling kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s protocol. Monoclonal anti\xe2\x80\x93acetylated \xce\xb1-tubulin (Clone 6-11B-1, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was detected with goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 or 647 at a dilution of 1:1000 or Cy5 (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:200. Immunoblotting was carried out according to the protocol described in Mittelmeier et al. (2008), except primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: 1:500 rabbit polyclonal anti-EYE2, 1:500 rabbit polyclonal anti-ChR1, and 1:10,000 mouse anti-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2; Sigma). Blots were probed with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:5,000 and/or goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Pierce, Rockford, IL) at a dilution of 1:10,000 in 1% NFDM-TBS-T for 2 hr at room temperature. Protein levels were estimated from a digital image of the blot using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ImageJ software Gel Anaylzer function. For each sample, the anti-ChR1 and anti-EYE2 signal were normalized to the antitubulin signal. Figures were prepared using Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems) and Microsoft Word (Microsoft). Micrographs were minimally adjusted for brightness and contrast using NIH ImageJ software, cropped in Adobe Photoshop, and reduced from the original size in Adobe Illustrator. To expand the collection of known eyespot mutants, a genetic screen for strains defective in phototaxis was conducted following insertional mutagenesis of wild-type strain 137c mt+ with the CRY-1 gene, which encodes ribosomal protein S14 (Nelson Et Al., 1994). A motile, ptx\xe2\x88\x92 strain was isolated that exhibited an equatorially localized miniature eyespot by bright field microscopy (Figure 1C) and was named min2-1. The mutation in min2-1 was found to be unlinked to the CRY-1 insertion. The average area of eyespots measured in a min2 population was 0.85 \xc2\xb1 0.16 \xce\xbcm2 (74% of wild-type area) compared with an average area of 0.38 \xc2\xb1 0.09 \xce\xbcm2 for min1 cells (34% of wild-type area) and average area of wild-type eyespots of 1.2 \xc2\xb1 0.24 \xce\xbcm2 (Table 2). As previously described, ChR1 photoreceptor localization is perturbed in the min1 mutant, appearing as stripes or multiple spots along the D4 rootlet (Mittelmeier et al. 2008; Figure 2B). If MIN2 has a role in promotion of eyespot organization comparable to that of MIN1, similar ChR1 localization patterns might be expected to be observed in the min2 strain. However, ChR1 staining patterns in min2 cells double-stained with antibodies directed against ChR1 and acetylated tubulin were unaffected, the photoreceptor patch retaining its nearly wild-type elliptical shape and rootlet association (Figure 2C). min1\xc2\xa0min2 double-mutant cells were typified by multiple ChR1 patches associated with the rootlet (Figure 2D), a phenotype similar to that of the min1 single mutant. When viewed by electron microscopy, the pigment granule spot in min1 cells grown in medium lacking acetate as a carbon source is a disorganized aggregation in the chloroplast stroma that lacks apposition to the chloroplast envelope and plasma membranes (Lamb et al. 1999). This finding was corroborated by immunofluorescence staining for ChR1 and the pigment granule marker EYE3; in photoautotropically grown min1 cells, the stromal pigment granules were separated from the photoreceptor (Figure 2E). By contrast, staining for both EYE3 and ChR1 in min2 cells demonstrated that the photoreceptor patch directly overlayed pigment granule layers (Figure 2F). Thus, the min2 mutation does not affect the overall assembly and/or maintenance of the eyespot layers. ChR1 photoreceptor localization and eyespot layers are altered in min1 but not min2.

(F) Organization of eyespot layers is unaffected in min2 cells, with ChR1 directly overlaying EYE3 staining (inset). Scale bars, 5 \xce\xbcm. min1 mutant cells assemble a miniature, disorganized eyespot when grown in medium lacking acetate (Figure 1B), but min1 cells grown in acetate-containing medium assemble eyespots that are more organized and closer in morphology to wild-type (Lamb et al. 1999; Mittelmeier et al. 2008). The eyespot morphology of min2 did not appear to differ between cells from cultures grown photoautotrophically in M medium and cells from cultures grown mixotrophically in acetate-containing (R) medium (Figure 3, E and F). The combination of the min1 and min2 mutations resulted in cells with an intensified eyespot-assembly defect. Of min1\xc2\xa0min2 cells scored following overnight growth in M medium, 58% had no observable eyespot by bright field microscopy (Table 4). The remainder of cells in the population had a miniature eyespot that appeared to be approximately min1-sized (see Figure 1D). In addition, min1\xc2\xa0min2 cells grown mixotrophically were unable to assemble a larger eyespot (Figure 3, G and H). Thus, eyespots can assemble in the absence of both MIN1 and MIN2 function, but the lack of MIN2 function exacerbates the eyespot-assembly defect of min1 mutants. The increased severity of the eyespot defects in min1\xc2\xa0min2 cells compared with those of min1 cells is suggestive that MIN2 is needed for aspects of eyespot assembly distinct from those governed by MIN1. Comparison of eyespot morphology in wild-type, min1, min2, and min1\xc2\xa0min2 cells grown without acetate or with acetate. Cells shown in the left column were grown in M medium (no acetate) and cells in the right column in R (+ acetate). Whereas min1 cells assemble a more organized, slightly larger eyespot when grown with acetate (D), no change in eyespot morphology is observed in wild-type (A, B), min2 (E, F), or min1\xc2\xa0min2 cells (G, H). Scale bars, 5 \xc2\xb5m. In a separate genetic screen of approximately 200 strains for ptx\xe2\x88\x92 mutants following 5-fluorodeoxyuridine-induced mutagenesis of wild-type strain 137c mt+, a strain that possessed multiple eyespots was identified and subsequently named mlt2. The mlt2 mutation complements mlt1-1 (10 ptx+ diploids with wild-type eyespots, n = 10). The mlt2 mutant displays defects in eyespot size and positioning as well as misregulation of eyespot number. As observed by bright field light microscopy, mlt2 cells have one to five eyespots that are positioned throughout the chloroplast (Figure 4C). Eyespots scored in a mlt2 population ranged in size from 0.04 to 1.39 \xce\xbcm2 (Figure 4E) and were on average smaller than wild-type, with a mean area of 0.49 \xc2\xb1 0.29 \xce\xbcm2 (n = 54) compared with the typical wild-type average of 1.2 \xce\xbcm2 (strain 137c). Interestingly, 21% of mlt2 cells have two pyrenoids (Figure 4D), but the strain had no observable growth defect (supporting information, Figure S1 and Table S1), suggestive that the multiple-pyrenoid phenomenon is not likely a result of defective cytokinesis. The mlt2 mutation thus affects the number of a chloroplastic structure other than to the eyespot. Characterization of multiple-eyespot mutant phenotypes. Arrows in A\xe2\x80\x93C indicate eyespots.

(D) Bright field micrograph of a mlt2 cell with two pyrenoids (arrows). Two pyrenoids are present in 21% of mlt2 cells, and 79% have one pyrenoid (n = 102). Bars, 5 \xc2\xb5m. (E) Distribution of eyespot sizes in wild-type (n = 100 eyespots) and a mlt2 population (n = 54 eyespots). Eyespots in the mlt2 mutant are distributed over a wide size range but are, on average, smaller than wild-type. In the mlt1 mutant, the ChR1 photoreceptor is localized to multiple patches most often observed in both longitudinal hemispheres of the cell in proximity to the anterior pole (Mittelmeier et al. 2011; see Figure 5A). Although ChR1 patches in mlt1 cells are usually associated with a rootlet, some lack rootlet association (Figure 5A, arrow). Disjunction of ChR1 patches and pigment granule spots has also been observed in the mlt1 mutant (Boyd et al. 2011b). Similar to the multiple eyespots observed in bright field, mlt2 cells double-labeled for ChR1 and acetylated tubulin exhibited multiple ChR1 patches that were most often associated with a microtubule rootlet (Figure 5B). We examined whether the mlt2 mutation elicits similar effects on the organization of eyespot components. In wild-type cells, distinct layering of ChR1, EYE2, and EYE3 is observed in the eyespot (Boyd et al. 2011a; Figure 5C). In min1 and eye3 mutants, in which the pigment granule layers are either disrupted or absent, EYE2 was most often observed copositioned with ChR1 (Boyd et al. 2011a). If the multiple-eyespot mutations predominantly affect the association of pigment granule layers with the rest of the eyespot, EYE2 might retain association with ChR1. In actuality, mlt1 and mlt2 were found to have dramatic effects on organization of eyespot components. In both mlt1 and mlt2 cells grown to stationary phase (\xe2\x88\xbc1.0 \xc3\x97 107 cells/mL), EYE2, EYE3, and ChR1 spots were visible singly (i.e. without either of the other two proteins associated) and in various combinations of copositioned spots (Figure 5F), including copositioning of EYE2 and EYE3 without ChR1. The distance between single spots was highly variable and could be relatively large in some cells (Figure 5D). Strikingly, copositioning of EYE3 and ChR1 was never observed in mlt1 or mlt2 cells unless EYE2 was also present in the copositioned spot (Table 3 and Figure 6), demonstrating that EYE2 is required for the chloroplast envelope link between the plasma membrane and pigment granule layers in the eyespot. Eyespots are disorganized in mlt1 and mlt2 mutant cells. (A, B) Combined immunofluorescence micrographs of individual cells stained for ChR1 (magenta) and AcTub (green).

Quantification of the extent of EYE2, EYE3, and ChR1 copositioning in mlt1 and mlt2 cells. Percentage of single or copositioned spots per total spots scored is shown. Copositioned spots of combinations of EYE2, EYE3, and ChR1 are markedly more prevalent in mlt1 cells compared with mlt2 cells. Conversely, mlt2 cells have a greater proportion of single EYE2, EYE3, or ChR1 spots not copositioned with other eyespot proteins. Copositioning of EYE3 with ChR1 was never observed without EYE2. The extent of EYE2, EYE3, and ChR1 copositioning was distributed variably in populations of both mlt1 and mlt2 cells (Table 3); however, mlt1 cells had a greater proportion of copositioned spots, while single spots of all three proteins predominated in stationary-phase mlt2 cells (Figure 6). Eyespots in mlt2 cells did show a large degree of copositioning in logarithmic growth phase (approx. 8.3 \xc3\x97 105 cells/mL), with 77% of spots consisting of EYE2, EYE3, and ChR1 that were mutually copositioned. At this cell density, 32% of mlt2 cells had one pigment granule spot, 55% had two pigment granule spots, and 13% had three or more pigment granule spots (n = 166). Together, these data are suggestive that to some extent MLT1, and especially MLT2, play roles in limiting formation of supernumerary eyespots and are required for maintenance of the supramolecular organization of the eyespot and that in the absence of MLT1 or MLT2 gene function, disintegration of the eyespot structure can occur after biogenesis of the organelle. To further characterize the effects of eyespot mutations on assembly of the organelle, eyespots were examined in double-mutant combinations of mini- and multiple-eyespot mutants. Of eyespots scored by bright field microscopy in a population of min2\xc2\xa0mlt1 double-mutant cells (n = 244), 76% had one eyespot, 13% had two eyespots, and 11% had no observable eyespot, in sharp contrast to the mostly multiple-eyespot phenotype of mlt1 cells after the same growth period (Table 2). Eyespots of double-mutant cells ranged in size from ultraminiature to approximately min2-sized, and ranged in position from the anterior tip of the chloroplast lobe (Figure 7B) to an approximately equatorial position. Among min2\xc2\xa0mlt1 cells with two eyespots, the proportion of eyespots on the same vs. opposite sides of the cell did not differ substantially from the proportions observed in mlt1 populations (Table 4). These data imply that the min2 mutation suppresses the eyespot number defect of mlt1, but it does not alter the defect in eyespot placement. Miniature-eyespot loci affect eyespot formation and photoreceptor placement in combination with mlt1 but not mlt2. (A, B) and (E, F) Bright field micrographs of individual cells.

Scale bars, 5\xce\xbcm. The combination of the min1 mutation with mlt1 produces a synthetic phenotype in which double-mutant cells are either eyeless or possess a single ultraminiature spot of unorganized pigment granules at or near the anterior tip of the chloroplast lobe (Lamb et al. 1999; Figure 7A). ChR1 localization in the min1\xc2\xa0mlt1 double mutant mirrored eyespot position as observed by bright field microcopy, appearing as a single, small spot near the anterior of the cell (Figure 7C). A similar phenotype was observed in some min2\xc2\xa0mlt1 cells, with a small ChR1 spot appearing at or near the anterior of the cell (Figure 7D). However, most min2\xc2\xa0mlt1 cells had no observable ChR1 staining, paralleled in immunoblot analysis by drastically reduced overall ChR1 levels compared with wild-type and either single mutant (Figure 8). Mutation of either miniature-eyespot locus in the mlt1 background thus results in magnified attenuation of ChR1 expression or stability when compared with the reduction observed in either the min1 or min2 single mutants. Immunoblot of wild-type and mutant strains probed for ChR1, EYE2, and tubulin. Whole-cell extracts were prepared after overnight growth in M medium. ChR1 and EYE2 levels were reduced approximately 75% and 93%, respectively, in min1 and 53% and 32%, respectively, in min2 single mutants compared with wild-type. ChR1 and EYE2 levels were reduced by approximately 75% and 65%, respectively, in the min1\xc2\xa0mlt1 double mutant and approximately 99% and 85%, respectively, in the min2\xc2\xa0mlt1 double mutant compared with wild-type. ChR1 and EYE2 were reduced 43% and 41%, respectively, in the mlt2 single mutant compared with wild-type, whereas ChR1 and EYE2 were reduced 66% and 62%, respectively, in min1\xc2\xa0mlt2 and 77% and 62%, respectively, in min2\xc2\xa0mlt2 compared with wild-type. Interestingly, combinations of mlt2 with either min1 or min2 did not yield synthetic eyespot phenotypes similar to those observed in min1\xc2\xa0mlt1 or min2\xc2\xa0mlt1. The min1\xc2\xa0mlt2 or min2\xc2\xa0mlt2 combination resulted in cells that exhibited the multiple-eyespot phenotype of mlt2, demonstrative that the multiple-eyespot phenotype of mlt2 is epistatic to both miniature-eyespot mutations (Figure 7, E and F). Although the overall levels of ChR1 and EYE2 were reduced in the min1\xc2\xa0mlt2 and min2\xc2\xa0mlt2 strains compared with the mlt2 single mutant (Figure 8), eyespot sizes in the min1\xc2\xa0mlt2 and min2\xc2\xa0mlt2 double mutants were not noticeably smaller than the range of sizes observed in mlt2 alone, and the localization patterns of ChR1 in min1\xc2\xa0mlt2 and min2\xc2\xa0mlt2 cells were similar to those observed in mlt2 cells (Figure 7, G and H). Thus, the min1 and min2 mutations affect steady-state levels of eyespot proteins but do not alter localization of photoreceptor to multiple patches in the mlt2 mutant background. The extremely low recombination frequency of mlt1 with mlt2 precluded isolation of multiple strains to confirm the phenotype of mlt1\xc2\xa0mlt2 double mutants, but phenotypic analysis of progeny from a tetratype tetrad from a mlt1 \xc3\x97 mlt2 cross was suggestive that mlt2 is also epistatic to mlt1 with regard to the number of supernumerary eyespots. Examination of diploids heterozygous for the either the mlt1 or mlt2 mutation indicated that neither mutation was dominant (10 ptx+ diploids, n = 10). These analyses are suggestive that MLT2 regulates eyespot number via a mechanism distinct from that of MLT1. The previously described MIN1, MLT1, and EYE2 loci were found to be mutually linked on chromosome 12 (Lamb et al. 1999), whereas the EYE3 locus is unlinked to the other three loci and maps to chromosome 2. Surprisingly, the MLT2 locus is very tightly linked to MLT1, with an estimated genetic distance of 0.50 map units, which is approximately equivalent to 50 kbp (Table 5). We are at present uncertain of the position of MLT2 relative to EYE2. Analysis of tetrad products from crosses of min2 to an allele of eye3 revealed that the min2 mutation is linked to eye3 within 7 map units (Table 5). The min2-eye3 linkage on chromosome 2 thus constitutes a second cluster of eyespot-assembly loci in C. reinhardtii in addition to that on chromosome 12. The complex structure of the photosensory eyespot organelle of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has invited investigation of the factors that contribute to the organization of this system from multiple cellular compartments. Several phototaxis-negative mutants with defects in eyespot assembly and placement have been isolated and have been informative in contributing to our understanding of the biogenesis and asymmetric positioning of this organelle (Dieckmann 2003; Kreimer 2009). Eyespot-assembly mutants fall into three main classes: eyeless mutants lacking organized pigment granule stacks, strains with a miniature eyespot, and strains possessing multiple eyespots. In this study, the miniature-eyed mutant min2 and multiple-eyespot mutant mlt2 have been further characterized and their loci mapped. Effects of these mutations on eyespot organization and steady-state levels of eyespot proteins have been assessed and are discussed in light of current understanding of eyespot biogenesis. Like the min1 mutant strain, cells of the min2-1 strain have a miniature eyespot located at the equator of the cell; in contrast to min1; however, the eyespot in min2 cells exhibited a properly layered morphology of photoreceptor and pigment granules. min2 cells are unable to phototax but can swim away from high-intensity light, although to a lesser extent than either min1 or the eyeless strains (Roberts 1999). These data were suggestive that the min2 mutation affects some aspect of the signal transduction pathway downstream of photoreceptor activation (Roberts 1999). The MIN2 protein may modulate the capacity of the photoreceptors for transduction of the photosignal upon light activation. Interestingly, mutation of the MIN2 locus in the mlt1 mutant background results in nearly complete abolition of ChR1 photoreceptor levels. MIN2 may be conditionally required for stability of photoreceptor molecules at a stage of the eyespot assembly process in conjunction with MLT1 function, whereas it is not required for photoreceptor stability in the organized eyespot layers. However, the enhanced eyespot-assembly defect of min1\xc2\xa0min2 double mutants may point to some role of MIN2 in promotion of structural stability of eyespot components. Both multiple-eyespot mutant strains, mlt1 and mlt2, are characterized by supernumerary, nonasymmetrically localized eyespots. The phenotype of the mlt2 mutant is highly similar to that of the multiple-eyespot mutant mes-10, described by Nakamura et al. (2001). It is likely that the mes-10 mutation is allelic to ml",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1-Feb, but as mes-10 gametes are unable to mate (Nakamura et al. 2001), it was not possible to carry out genetic characterization of this mutant strain. Like mlt2 cells, mes-10 cells have one to over four eyespots per cell that display a range of sizes, and half of mes-10 cells possessed two pyrenoids, a phenotype also observed in mlt2, albeit at a lower frequency. The ultrastructure of mes-10 eyespots examined by electron microscopy appeared normal, with regular pigment granule layers and the chloroplast envelope apposed to the plasma membrane, although occasional pigment granule stacks faced the surface of the chloroplast envelope near the nucleus rather than being apposed to the plasma membrane. A high proportion of spots wherein EYE2, EYE3, and ChR1 are mutually copositioned was observed during logarithmic phase in mlt1 and mlt2 cells, suggestive that eyespots in these mutants initially form according to the normal assembly process and subsequently lose structural integrity. Thus, the appearance of multiple spots of eyespot components in distinct and often widely separated punctae in stationary-phase cells likely represents eyespots at various stages of disintegration. In both mlt1 and mlt2 cells, pigment granules and photoreceptors were never observed without EYE2, demonstrating that the EYE2 patch, which is likely anchored to the chloroplast envelope, is required for linkage of the plasma membrane\xe2\x80\x93localized photoreceptors to the pigment granule layers of the eyespot. The defects in the placement of eyespot compartments observed in both the mlt1 and mlt2 mutants indicate that upregulation of eyespot number disrupts maintenance of eyespot organization. Further, the observation of multiple pyrenoids in a substantial subset of mlt2 cells intimates that the roles of MLT2 extend beyond eyespot formation to processes affecting the biogenesis of other chloroplastic structures. MLT2 may be a transcriptional or translational repressor under cell-cycle control, wherein loss of function leads to continued synthesis of assembly proteins beyond the typical window of eyespot development. The phenotypes of miniature- and multiple-eyespot mutants are consistent with the idea that eyespot assembly follows a \xe2\x80\x9cquantal synthesis\xe2\x80\x9d model of organelle biogenesis (Stephens 1989; Rafelski and Marshall 2008), in which lack of some eyespot proteins results in a smaller organelle (as in the min1 and min2 mutants), whereas misregulated expression of other eyespot components leads to the formation of multiple eyespots that lose structural integrity if other critical proteins are limiting. Application of this model has been demonstrated experimentally in studies on C. reinhardtii flagella (Rosenbaum et al. 1969; Coyne and Rosenbaum 1970). It would be informative to follow expression of eyespot-assembly genes during the cell cycle in multiple-eyespot mutants. In combination with mlt1, both the min1 and min2 mutations suppress the multiple-eyespot phenotype of mlt1. It is possible that limitation of eyespot material caused by absence of MIN1 or MIN2 masks the disregulation of eyespot localization and number cues resulting from mutations in MLT1. The epistasis of mlt2 to min1 and min2, in addition to the ability of mlt2 cells to assemble wild-type\xe2\x80\x93sized eyespots, may indicate that the upregulation of eyespot number in the mlt2 mutant overcomes limitations imposed by the relatively lower abundance of some eyespot proteins. The dramatic differences between combinations of miniature-eyespot mutations with mlt1 and mlt2 reinforce the hypothesis that the mode of regulation of eyespot number and placement by MLT1 is distinct from that of MLT2. Characterization and localization of the MIN and MLT proteins should greatly assist our understanding of the mechanisms of action of these factors. It is quite interesting that both the min2 and mlt2 mutations map to novel loci near existing eyespot-assembly genes. As suggested in Lamb et al. (1999), the clustering of eyespot-assembly loci may be an instrument for coordinated gene expression that is linked to cell-cycle control. The tight linkage, especially of mlt2 to mlt1, is supportive of the idea that the MLT1 and MLT2 genes, though distinct, affect similar aspects of eyespot development and are coordinately regulated. Identifying the gene products of these loci and determining the nature of the min2 and mlt2 mutations will be valuable for extending our knowledge of the assembly and organization of this intriguing organelle.

The production of defined lines necessarily homogenizes genetic background and thus may be expected to obscure the effects of unlinked allorecognition loci should they exist. Here, we report the results of crosses in which inbred lines were out-crossed to wild-type animals in an attempt to identify dominant, codominant, or incompletely dominant modifiers of allorecognition. A claim for the existence of modifiers unlinked to ARC was rejected for three different genetic backgrounds. Estimates of the genetic map distance of ARC in two wild-type haplotypes differed markedly from one another and from that measured in congenic lines. These results suggest that additional allodeterminants exist in the Hydractinia ARC.Colonial marine invertebrates often encounter conspecifics when encrusting hard surfaces in the sea. As such animals have limited or no capacity for movement, cell-to-cell contact between individuals inevitably results. Allorecognition at such contacts triggers a sequence of events that typically involves a binary choice between fusion and rejection. Allorecognition decisions have long been appreciated to be under genetic control based on the observation that fusion is rare except among close kin. A more detailed genetic understanding of fusibility is available for two organisms, both of which have developed into model systems for the study of this phenomenon. The two systems are Botryllus schlosseri, an invertebrate chordate, and Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, a cnidarian and the subject of this study [recently reviewed by Rosengarten and Nicotra (2011)]. The genetic analysis of fusibility in Hydractinia began with the work of Hauenschild (1954). In a series of crosses with wild-type animals he provided support for a one-locus system with alleles of different strength. Hauenschild\xe2\x80\x99s scheme was largely successful in accounting for the segregation patterns he observed, but several fusibility results defied explanation based on a one-locus model. Dupasquier (1974) reanalyzed Hauenschild\xe2\x80\x99s data and noted that, if one assumed the existence of two linked loci and further assumed that one of Hauenschild\xe2\x80\x99s crosses involved a recombinant animal, then several (but not all) of the original inconsistencies were resolved. No further work was reported for another 22 years until Mokady and Buss (1996) developed a near-isogenic line. Their study was based on a large number of crosses each with a small segregating population. Fusibility was shown to segregate as a single chromosomal interval within the line. The development of a near-isogenic line was followed by the development of a near-congenic line. Using the congenic line, Cadavid et al. (2004) mapped the chromosomal interval and showed that it comprised at least distinct two loci. The interval was called ARC (for allorecognition complex), and the allorecognition loci were designated alr1 and alr2. The allorecognition loci alr1 and alr2 have recently been identified by positional cloning (Nicotra et al. 2009; Rosa et al. 2010). Both genes encode putative transmembrane receptor proteins with extracellular domains resembling Ig-like domains and with intracellular sequence motifs similar to immunoregulatory signaling motifs. Both proteins bear hypervariable domains most similar to Ig-like V-set domains. Comparison of several wild-type alleles of both loci identified multiple V-set residues under positive selection. Notably, alr1 was found to be contained within a large family of structurally similar immunoglobulin superfamily-like genes (Rosa et al. 2010). Knowledge of the alr1 and alr2 genotype fully predicted fusibility within the inbred and congenic lines (Cadavid et al. 2004; Powell et al. 2007). Specifically, if animals shared one ARC haplotype, they fuse, and if they share no ARC haplotype, they reject. Animals that do not share an allele at one alr locus but do share an allele at the other alr locus undergo a form of transitory fusion, where colonies initially fuse and thereafter separate from one another. The chronology and other aspects of the phenomenology of the separation vary depending on the locus at which the alleles are shared (Powell et al. 2007). Whether the \xe2\x80\x9cfusion rules\xe2\x80\x9d elucidated for the congenic lines were sufficient to explain wild-type variation in fusibility remained an open question until the alr loci were identified. Fusion is rare in the field (Nicotra and Buss 2005). Two separate tests of fusibility in wild-type colonies have been performed. In the first, wild-type animals were found that fused or underwent transitory fusion with animals from inbred lines, and the sequence of alr alleles was obtained to determine if they matched. A survey of 535 animals yielded two such animals and both bore matching alleles (Nicotra et al. 2009; Rosa et al. 2010). In a related test, wild-type alr1 and alr2 alleles were sequenced, and fusion tests were subsequently performed on colonies found to bear one or more matching alleles. Five pairs of colonies were identified as bearing matching alleles, and four of the five pairs displayed a fusible phenotype (Rosa et al. 2010). In both tests, transitory fusion was observed in some colonies, when permanent fusion was expected (or vice versa). These observations indicate that alr1 and alr2 are major determinants of allorecognition in the wild, but they also indicate that additional allodeterminants are yet to be identified. Two alternative genetic explanations are readily suggested. These additional allodeterminants could be unlinked modifying loci that were heretofore undetected because they were homogenized by the inbreeding program employed to identify the ARC. Alternatively, unlinked modifying loci may play a minimal role, but additional, unidentified loci within different ARC haplotypes may act as allodeterminants. Under this hypothesis, such loci differ between wild-types and inbred haplotypes but not within the congenic lines. The first of these hypotheses can be easily addressed by classical breeding approaches. The conventional test for dominant modifiers is to introduce alleles from an inbred line into a wild-type genetic background and test for the appearance of the predicted phenotype in homozygotes derived in backcross or F2 incross progeny (Green 1981). We provide such a test for three different genetic backgrounds and report no effect of genetic background on fusibility. Unexpectedly, these crosses yielded different map distances for the size of the ARC complex from that repeatedly measured for congenic lines.'","b'The Hydractinia allorecognition complex (ARC) was initially identified as a single chromosomal interval using inbred and congenic lines.

These additional allodeterminants could be unlinked modifying loci that were heretofore undetected because they were homogenized by the inbreeding program employed to identify the ARC. Alternatively, unlinked modifying loci may play a minimal role, but additional, unidentified loci within different ARC haplotypes may act as allodeterminants. Under this hypothesis, such loci differ between wild-types and inbred haplotypes but not within the congenic lines. The first of these hypotheses can be easily addressed by classical breeding approaches. The conventional test for dominant modifiers is to introduce alleles from an inbred line into a wild-type genetic background and test for the appearance of the predicted phenotype in homozygotes derived in backcross or F2 incross progeny (Green 1981). We provide such a test for three different genetic backgrounds and report no effect of genetic background on fusibility. Unexpectedly, these crosses yielded different map distances for the size of the ARC complex from that repeatedly measured for congenic lines. ARC haplotypes are labeled by letter, so a homozygous animal is designated as ARC-f/f and a heterozygous animal as, say, ARC-f/r. We make use of two near-inbred lines and one near-congenic line. These two inbred lines are designated as ARC-f/f and ARC-r/r. The congenic line has the ARC-r haplotype introgressed into the ARC-f/f genetic background. The complete pedigree of the lines can be obtained by concatenating previously published pedigrees (Cadavid et al. 2004; Mokady and Buss 1996; Poudyal et al. 2007; Powell et al. 2007). We tested the effect of genetic background by using three wild-type animals. OQ6D, with haplotypes designated as ARC-c and ARC-d, was collected from the shallow subtidal just seaward of One Tree Island in Old Quarry Harbor, Guilford, CT, in 2002. LH06-082, with haplotypes ARC-a and ARC-b, was collected intertidally from Lighthouse Point, New Haven, CT, in 2006. LH06-003, with haplotypes ARC-i and ARC-r2, were collected intertidally in 2006 at Meig\xe2\x80\x99s Point, Madison, CT. No ARC alleles are shared between the three wild-types, indicating that the three wild-types are not closely related. The sequences of both alr1 and alr2 for each haplotype have been published previously (Nicotra et al. 2009; Rosa et al. 2010; Rosengarten et al. 2011). Two of the three genetic backgrounds were chosen because the original wild-type animals were identified as giving a phenotypic response different from that expected based on fusion rules developed for congenic animals. Specifically, LH06-082 bears an ARC-f\xe2\x80\x93like haplotype and displays transitory fusion when paired with an ARC-f/f tester, when fusion would be expected (Nicotra et al. 2009; Rosa et al. 2010). LH06-003 has an alr2-r\xe2\x80\x93like allele and would be predicted to display transitory fusion to an ARC-r/r tester, but instead, it rejects. Note that using such backgrounds increases the likelihood that we will detect unlinked modifiers if they exist. Crosses were made using established techniques (Cadavid et al. 2004; Mokady and Buss 1996; Powell et al. 2007), and colonies were maintained under standard conditions (Blackstone and Buss 1991). To test for the presence of unlinked dominant, codominant, or incompletely dominant allorecognition modifiers, we crossed a wild-type animal with an inbred or cogenic line and retrieved progeny homozygous for inbred ARC haplotypes. Inbred colonies used for matings are given in supporting information, Table S2, and Figure 1. In the OQ6D background we retrieved ARC homozygotes from either backcrosses (i.e. crosses AP100 and AP101 in Figure 1A) or crosses to an inbred colony that was near-isogenic to the original inbred parent (i.e. crosses AP105 and LB132 in Figure 1A). The latter were necessary to include female progeny crossed with male inbreds and are effectively identical to backcrosses, as all inbred animals are near isogenic. In the LH06-082 and LH06-003 genetic backgrounds, we used sib crosses to retrieve ARC homozygous progeny (Figure 1, B and C). In LH06-003 background only two homozygous progeny were recovered from the initial F2 population, requiring a series of additional crosses (Figure 1C). Identifying homozygotes bearing inbred ARC haplotypes required that we genotype at two or more ARC molecular markers (see below) which yielded information on the frequency of recombination. Pedigree of crosses used to generate mapping populations. Males are represented by boxes, females by circles. Black represents individuals collected from the wild, white represents laboratory inbred lines, and lighter and darker shades of gray represent 50% and 25% contributions of the wild-type genetic background, respectively. ARC haplotypes are given inside icons, and colony identification numbers are underneath. Backcrosses and sib crosses used to generate homozygous ARC haplotypes in 50% or 25% wild-type background are shown as dashed lines, and the resulting progeny population identification numbers are shown in ellipses. Lineage derived from wild-type (A) OQ6D, (B) LH06-082, and (C) LH06-003. Progeny identified as homozygous for the inbred ARC-f and ARC-r haplotype were tested for fusibility against allocompatible inbred lines. Colony fusion assays were performed in the conventional manner (Buss et al. 1984; Powell et al. 2007). An ARC-f/f animal in a wild-type genetic background would be expected to fuse to an ARC-f/f inbred tester if there were no effective allorecognition modifier in the background. Any departure from the fusion phenotype is evidence for a modifier. An inbred ARC-f/f tester (colony IDs 833-8 and LB217-11, respectively) was used for tests involving the OQ6D and LH06-003 genetic backgrounds. Two ARC-r/r testers, one from an inbred line (colony ID 4117-2) and the other from the congenic line (colony ID MP104-34) were used for tests involving the LH06-082 background. Fusion tests were observed 3\xe2\x80\x937 days/week during the first two weeks and weekly thereafter for a minimum of three additional weeks, up to a maximum of three months. Backcrosses and F2 incross progeny share 50% wild-type background and 50% inbred background, which is equivalent to saying that each individual had a 0.5 chance of inheriting a modifier. Each progeny provides an independent sample of the wild-type genetic background, so the number of individuals (n) that must be tested to ensure detection at a given probability is (0.5)n for a dominant modifier. An n > 5 is required for P < 0.05. The terminal populations in the LH06-003 pedigree (Figure 1C) have a 25% chance of inheriting a modifier. If n progeny are recovered from the F2 incross and m from the terminal populations, the probability of failing to detect a modifier is P = (0.75)2n+m. Single polyp and larval DNA extractions were performed using the procedures described in Powell et al. (2007). Crosses in the OQ6D and LH06-082 genetic backgrounds were genotyped using markers that spanned the ARC to detect animals that were recombinant over the complex. Sample sizes precluded determination of map distances for LH06-003 and LH06-082 haplotypes. With two exceptions, the markers used for ARC genotyping have been described earlier; all alleles, primers, and references are provided in Table S1. Conditions for the two new markers, 194c28 and 174i1, are as follows. Marker 194c28 was amplified in a 25 \xce\xbcl PCR containing 1 \xc3\x97 Phusion HF Buffer, 3% DMSO, 0.4 \xce\xbcM each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP, and 0.5 \xce\xbcl of Phusion DNA polymerase. Reaction conditions were 98\xc2\xb0 for 30 s followed by 35 cycles of 98\xc2\xb0 10s, 62\xc2\xb0 30s, 72\xc2\xb0 1 min, and a final extension at 72\xc2\xb0 5 min. Products were digested with NdeI and analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Marker 174i1 was amplified in a 25 \xce\xbcl PCR containing 10% PCR buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.8 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.75 \xce\xbcM of common primer (1st primer, Table S1) and 0.5 \xce\xbcM of each allele-specific primer (2nd primer, Table S1). Reactions conditions were 94\xc2\xb0 for 1 min, 25 cycles of 94\xc2\xb0 20s, 58\xc2\xb0 30s, 72\xc2\xb0 60s, with a final extension at 72\xc2\xb0 for 4 min. The relative locations of the markers within the ARC are shown in Figure 2. Note that the ARC interval has not been physically closed, but the physical interval characterized spans in excess of 2.3 Mb. Markers designated with the same numerical prefix (e.g.194 or 174) are closely linked relative to the size of the interval. Hereafter, when we refer to the 194-174 distance in centimorgans, we treat markers with the same prefix as identical. Locations of markers within the ARC. (A) Genetic map of the ARC from Powell et al. (2007) with genetic distance shown in centimorgans. (B) Relative spacing of markers on the both the 194 and 174 loci shown to scale. Contigs containing alr1 and alr2 of 1.3 Mb and \xe2\x88\xbc312 kb, respectively, have been sequenced. A third sequenced contig (not shown) of 0.7 Mb lies between these. The physical size of the intervening regions is not yet known. Map distances were computed using MapMaker (Lander et al. 1987). MapDraw (Liu and Meng 2003) was used to draw linkage maps to scale. To augment sample sizes, we repeated several crosses and extracted DNA from mature planulae. We pooled samples of larvae and colonies when testing segregation ratios and calculating map distances. The crosses used to test for dominant modifiers in three different genetic backgrounds are presented in Table S2 and Figure 1. In the OQ6D genetic background, four crosses were made and homozygotes identified. A total of 37 ARC-f/f homozygous individuals were tested, and all exhibited permanent fusion to an ARC-f/f tester colony. In the LH06-082 genetic background, a single F2 incross was performed, and 10 different ARC-r/r homozygotes were tested. All progeny exhibited permanent fusion to the ARC-r/r tester. In the LH06-003 background, 2 ARC-f/f homozygotes were identified in an F2 population and an additional 8 homozygotes were identified from the terminal populations. All exhibited permanent fusion to the ARC-f/f tester. The hypothesis of dominant, codominant, or incompletely dominant modifiers of allorecognition assorting independently of ARC can be rejected for the OQ6D and LH06-082 backgrounds at P < 0.001 and rejected for the LH06-003 genetic background at P < 0.05. Genotype data from the two ARC-f/f \xc3\x97 ARC-f/d crosses were pooled. The two ARC-f/f \xc3\x97 ARC-f/c crosses were genotyped using different markers and are reported separately. All markers for both crosses segregated in the expected single locus Mendelian ratios (Table 1). Raw data are available in Table S3. Map distances between ARC genetic markers varied widely (Figure 3), ranging from 1.6 to 30.5 cM for the interval between markers 194 and 174. Two of these maps measured distances generated from f and c haplotypes. In the ARC-f/f \xc3\x97 ARC-f/c cross, the order of markers 28m6 and 174m4 was inverted relative to that determined for the ARC-f/f \xc3\x97 ARC-f/r cross and the ARC-f/f \xc3\x97 ARC-f/d cross. The inverted map order was not well supported, with a relative log likelihood of \xe2\x88\x921.74, which corresponds to support by an odds ratio of 50:1. Both wild-type haplotype map distances were substantially in excess of the 1.6 cM previously measured using the congenic ARC-f/f \xc3\x97 ARC-f/r crosses (Powell et al. 2007). Pairwise differences in map distances were evaluated using the total heterogeneity of fit statistic (Liu 1998). Whereas no significant heterogeneity was detected between the maps resulting from the two different f/c crosses (P = 0.08, total heterogeneity goodness of fit statistic), when these were compared to the f/d map, significant heterogeneity was detected (P < 0.01) The heterogeneity was not due to segregation distortion and can therefore be attributed to differences in the relative rates of recombination between haplotypes. Genetic maps in centimorgans drawn to scale. The total map distance is given below each map. Data for the f/r map from Cadavid et al. (2004) and Powell et al. (2007). We failed to detect evidence for the assortment of dominant, codominant, or incompletely dominant modifiers of allorecognition in Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Previously, a small number of cases were reported in which the genotype of the two known allodeterminants (alr1 and alr2) failed to account for wild-type fusibility (Rosa et al. 2010). Our results show that these cases cannot readily be explained by appeal to dominant modifying loci unlinked to the ARC. The results reported here, when combined with the recent finding that the ARC complex includes a large number of Ig-superfamily genes bearing structural similarity to the known alr loci, raises the distinct possibility that additional genes within the ARC complex may act as allodeterminants. Two caveats are germane. First, the breeding designs (OQ6D background) or sample sizes (LH06-003 and LH06-082 backgrounds) used do not allow us to test for recessive modifiers of allorecognition. Second, modifiers might act in a dosage-dependent fashion. In this study, the entire ARC interval was introduced into a wild-type background. Modifiers might have been detected if the number of matching alr loci within the ARC differed between test and out-crossed animals. Both possibilities are amenable to further study by classical breeding techniques. Unexpectedly, we found very substantial variation in map distances in two wild-type ARC haplotypes relative to the size reported for our congenic line. Our congenic line, involving the ARC-f and ARC-r haplotypes, has been measured in a number of crosses to be about 2 cM (Cadavid et al. 2004; Powell et al. 2007). The two ARC haplotypes examined here exceeded this figure by large factors. Recent findings bear note in this regard. First, the ARC is now known to be composed of a large number of structurally similar genes (Rosa et al. 2010). Although the full extent of the family is not yet known, the minimal size is 13 Ig-superfamily genes for ARC-f (Nicotra et al. 2009; Rosa et al. 2010). Tandemly duplicated gene families are known to be prone to both enhanced rates of recombination and gene conversion (Chen et al. 2007; Gangloff et al. 1996; Norman et al. 2009; Robbins et al. 1991). Indeed, patterns of sequence similarity between wild-type alr1 alleles and other ARC loci strongly suggest that different loci within the ARC complex may serve as sequence donors to one another (Rosa et al. 2010). Such processes may be expected to lead to structural divergence between haplotypes. A study of the genomic interval surrounding alr2 in three different haplotypes has documented extensive structural variation (Rosengarten et al. 2011). The large map distances detected in wild-type haplotypes raise the possibility that more extensive recombination between alr1 and alr2 is the norm. A high frequency of recombination may be expected to obscure single locus segregation when testing fusibility between progeny populations involving wild-type animals as was once reported (Grosberg et al. 1996).The small map distance documented in the congenic line might, for example, be generated by structural variation between haplotypes. Resolution of this issue will require the assembly of a reference sequence of the full ARC complex and subsequent comparison of the interval from multiple haplotypes.

There is a significant genetic component to IS susceptibility, especially among young adults. To date, research to identify genetic loci predisposing to stroke has met only with limited success. We performed a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis of early-onset IS to identify potential stroke susceptibility loci. The GWA analysis was conducted by genotyping 1 million SNPs in a biracial population of 889 IS cases and 927 controls, ages 15\xe2\x80\x9349 years. Genotypes were imputed using the HapMap3 reference panel to provide 1.4 million SNPs for analysis. Logistic regression models adjusting for age, recruitment stages, and population structure were used to determine the association of IS with individual SNPs. Although no single SNP reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x928), we identified two SNPs in chromosome 2q23.3, rs2304556 (in FMNL2; P = 1.2 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927) and rs1986743 (in ARL6IP6; P = 2.7 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927), strongly associated with early-onset stroke. These data suggest that a novel locus on human chromosome 2q23.3 may be associated with IS susceptibility among young adults.Age-related stroke is a common debilitating disease that ranks among the leading causes of death in the United States (Rosamond et al. 2008). Ischemic stroke (IS) comprises approximately 85% of all strokes. While hypertension, cigarette smoking, and diabetes are well-established risk factors for IS, family and twin studies provide evidence that IS aggregates within families (Flossmann et al. 2004), thus implicating a genetic contribution to stroke susceptibility. Efforts to identify the genetic determinants of IS have had limited success. One strategy to enhance the chances of identifying stroke susceptibility genes is to study stroke cases that are more likely to have a strong genetic predisposition. Such cases might include those with a strong family history of stroke or those experiencing a stroke at a relatively young age. Such strategies have been successful in identifying genes associated with early-onset forms of other complex diseases, including breast cancer (Walsh et al. 2006), Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s disease (Lesage et al. 2008), obesity (Hinney et al. 2007; Scherag et al. 2010), inflammatory bowel disease (Imielinski et al. 2009), and myocardial infarction (Kathiresan et al. 2009). Evidence from twin (Brass et al. 1992; Brass et al. 1998; Hassan and Markus 2000) and familial aggregation studies (Schulz et al. 2004), in fact, supports a stronger genetic contribution to early-onset than later-onset stroke. We have previously reported in our own study of young-onset stroke that the proportion of cases reporting a family history of stroke increases with decreasing age of the proband (MacClellan et al. 2006). We have performed a case-control study of IS in subjects ages 15\xe2\x80\x9349 years.

In this report, we present results of a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis based on 1.4 million SNPs genotyped and/or imputed across the genome for their association with risk of IS. The Genetics of Early Onset Stroke (GEOS) Study is a population-based, case-control study designed to identify genes associated with early-onset ischemic stroke and to characterize interactions of identified stroke genes and/or SNPs with environmental risk factors. Participants were recruited from the greater Baltimore-Washington area in four different periods: Stroke Prevention in Young Women-1 (SPYW-1) conducted from 1992 to 1996, Stroke Prevention in Young Women-2 (SPYW-2) conducted from 2001 to 2003, Stroke Prevention in Young Men (SPYM) conducted from 2003 to 2007, and Stroke Prevention in Young Adults (SPYA) conducted in 2008. From these samples, we identified a total of 921 cases and 941 controls that consented to having their DNA used for genetic studies of stroke. This study was conducted with the consent of all study participants and was approved by the University of Maryland at Baltimore Institutional Review Board. \xe2\x80\x9cCase participants\xe2\x80\x9d were hospitalized with a first cerebral infarction identified by discharge surveillance from one of the 59 hospitals in the greater Baltimore-Washington area and direct referral from regional neurologists. IS with the following characteristics were excluded from participation: stroke occurring as an immediate consequence of trauma; stroke within 48 hr after a hospital procedure, stroke within 60 days after the onset of a nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral venous thrombosis. Additional exclusions for these genetic analyses are listed in Table 1. All cases had neuroimaging that was consistent with cerebral infarction, although neuroimaging was not used for case ascertainment. The abstracted hospital records of cases were reviewed and adjudicated for IS subtype by a pair of neurologists according to previously published procedures (Johnson et al. 1995; Kittner et al. 1998), with disagreements resolved by a third neurologist. The IS subtype classification system retains information on all probable and possible causes, and it is reducible to the more widely used TOAST system (Adams et al. 1993) that assigns each case to a single category. All cases had age of first stroke between 15 and 49 years and were recruited within three years of stroke. \xe2\x80\x9cControl participants\xe2\x80\x9d without a history of stroke were identified by random-digit dialing. Controls were balanced to cases by age and region of residence in each study and were additionally balanced for race in SPYW-2 and SPYM. Traditional stroke risk factors and other study variables, including age, race/ethnicity, history of hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction (MI), and current smoking status (defined as use within one month prior to event for cases and at a comparable reference time for controls), were also collected during a standardized interview. Genomic DNA was isolated from a variety of sample types, including cell line (55.2%), whole blood (43.1%), mouth wash (0.4%), and buccal swab (0.05%). Whole-genome amplification (Qiagen REPLI-g kit, Valencia, CA) was used to obtain sufficient DNA for genotyping in 1.3% of samples. The distribution of sample types did not differ significantly between cases and controls (56.3% cell lines in cases vs. 54.1% in controls; 41.5% whole blood in cases vs. 44.9% in controls). Samples were genotyped at the Johns Hopkins Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), and genotyping was performed using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad_v1-0_B BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Case and control samples were balanced across the plates, and self-identified whites and African Americans were placed on different plates. Samples of 50 self-reported whites were also placed on African American plates for quality control. All study samples, including 39 blind duplicates (19 whites and 20 African Americans), were plated and genotyped together with 42 HapMap control samples, including 26 Utah residents with ancestry from northern and Western Europe (CEU) and 16 Yoruba (YRI) samples, and all samples were processed together in the lab. Allele cluster definitions for each SNP were determined using Illumina BeadStudio Genotyping Module version 3.3.7, Gentrain version 1.0, and the combined intensity data from all released samples. Genotypes were not called if the quality threshold (Gencall score) was below 0.15. Genotypes of a total of 1827 study individuals (99% of attempted samples) were released by CIDR, and all had a genotype call rate greater than 98%. Genotyping concordance rate was 99.996% based on study duplicates. We excluded 11 individuals from analysis due to unexpected duplicates, gender discrepancy, or unexpected relatedness, leaving a total of 1816 individuals (889 cases and 927 controls) in the final analysis. A total of 1,014,719 SNPs were released by CIDR (99.83% of attempted). Genotypes were not released for SNPs that had call rates less than 85%, a cluster separation value of less than 0.2, more than 1 HapMap replicate error, more than a 5% (autosomal) or 6% (X) difference in call rate between sexes, more than 0.3% male AB frequency (X), or more than a 11.3% (autosomal) or 10% (XY) difference in AB frequency. Individual SNPs were excluded postanalysis if they had excessive deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) proportions (P < 1.0 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927) or genotype call rates less than 95%. Departure from HWE was assessed by \xcf\x872 test among controls only and among each ethnic group separately. For this report, only SNPs having minor allele frequencies (MAF) greater than 1% and SNPs passing HWE filtering in both genetically defined (see Statistical Analysis below) European ancestry (EA) and African ancestry (AA) populations were included (N = 784,766 SNPs). Imputation was performed for genetically defined EA cohort (N = 946) and AA cohort (N = 733) separately using BEAGLE v3.3 software (Browning and Browning 2009). Genetically defined EA participants were those within two standard deviations (SD) of the mean of the first and second principal components for subjects self-identified as \xe2\x80\x9cwhite,\xe2\x80\x9d and similarly, genetically defined AA participants were those within two SD of the mean of the first and second principal components for those self-identified as \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican American.\xe2\x80\x9d The combined samples of CEU and Tuscans from Italy (TSI) from the HapMap Phase 3 populations were used as the reference panel for EA cohort imputation. A combination of five HapMap Phase 3 populations, CEU, TSI, YRI, Luhya in Webuye, Kenya (LWK), and African ancestry in southwest United States (ASW), was used as reference panel for AA cohort imputation, in accordance with the recommendation that a mixture of populations be used as the reference panel for African Americans (Hao et al. 2009). All SNPs failing the composite quality filter were removed [i.e. SNPs with missing call rate \xe2\x89\xa5 5%, SNPs with Mendelian errors in three HapMap trios > 0, HWE P < 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x924, and SNPs with more than one discordant genotype call across the 89 duplicated study samples (39 blind duplicates and 50 white duplicates plated on African American plates]. All remaining SNPs having a MAF \xe2\x89\xa5 1% in each respective cohort were used as input SNPs for imputation. A total of 1,387,466 SNPs were obtained via imputation, which included 532,595 and 582,186 input SNPs for the EA and AA cohorts, respectively. Imputed SNPs that have an estimated squared correlation between the estimated allele dosage and the true allele dosage (dosage r2) < 0.3 were removed postanalysis. The dosage r2 can be derived from arguments found in Appendix 1 of Browning and Browning (2009). For this study, we supplemented 784,766 SNPs genotyped by the Illumina Omni1-Quad chip with 637,233 imputed SNPs with r2 > 0.3 for a total of 1,421,999 SNPs in the final genome-wide association report. To assess the performance of imputation, analysis was performed of a masked set of SNPs on chromosome 1. We first masked a randomly selected set of 20% of all Omni1 array SNPs on chromosome 1 that passed the preimputation filters. The masked SNPs were then removed from input files for imputation, and then imputation was performed using the same procedures as described previously. The imputed genotypes at the \xe2\x80\x9cmasked\xe2\x80\x9d SNPs were then compared with the experimental (typed) genotypes from Omni1 GWAS data to assess the accuracy of imputation. The SNP concordance rates, which were defined as fraction of identical genotypes between the most likely imputed and observed, were 0.9858 for EA and 0.9805 for AA (filtering imputed genotypes at posterior probability \xe2\x89\xa5 0.9). The correlations between observed vs. expected allele frequencies for all imputed SNPs were also very high (0.99967 for EA and 0.99937 for AA). The plot of the observed allelic frequency vs. expected allelic frequency from imputation is shown in supporting information, Figure S1. Summary statistics of study characteristics were calculated and expressed as unadjusted means \xc2\xb1 SDs (SD) or percentages, stratified by case status. We compared cases and controls for difference in means using t-tests (for continuous variables) or difference in proportions by \xcf\x872 tests (for categorical variables) to obtain the unadjusted two-sided P values. Logistic regression with case/control status as the outcome and baseline characteristics as predictors was used to obtain the age- and sex-adjusted P values. All summary statistics of study characteristics were obtained using the STATA statistical package (version 9.2; StataCorp, College Station, TX). GWA analysis was performed using a logistic regression model to test for associations of each SNP with IS under an additive model (for imputed SNPs, estimated allelic dosage was used). A t-score was used to assess the significance of the beta coefficient (\xce\xb2) for the SNP, and the odds ratio (OR) was derived by exponentiation of the beta coefficient. All estimates were obtained after adjusting for the effect of age, recruitment periods (three indicator variables), and population structure. Population structure was estimated using multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis on the matrix of genome-wide identical-by-state (IBS) pairwise distances, which were estimated based on 127,901 typed (not imputed) SNPs that were selected for having MAF > 5%, SNP call rates > 95%, and not being in linkage disequilibrium with other selected SNPs (i.e. pair-wise LD between any two SNPs was constrained to be r2 < 0.2). The first 10 dimensions of population structure were extracted using MDS, but only the first dimension was significantly associated with case status and included as a covariate in the association analysis. Similar to imputation, study subjects were divided into genetically defined EA and AA groups for association analyses based on population structure analysis. EA participants were defined as those failing within two SD of the mean of the first and second components for self-reported \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d subjects, and AA participants were defined as falling within two SD of the mean of the first and second components for self-reported \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican American\xe2\x80\x9d subjects. Association analyses were conducted in the total population, adjusting for the first MDS component, as well as for genetically defined EA and AA groups separately. Genome-wide significance level was set at \xce\xb1 = 5.0 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x928 after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. All analyses were performed using existing programs implemented in PLINK version 1.07 (Purcell et al. 2007). Power calculations (using Quanto v1.2.4) indicated that our sample size of 889 cases and 927 controls provided 80% power to detect ORs ranging 1.55\xe2\x80\x932.30 for allele frequencies ranging 10\xe2\x80\x9350% at an \xce\xb1 = 5.0 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x928. We also reviewed previous genome-wide association studies on IS. We identified one gene, NINJ2, reported previously to be genome-wide significantly associated with stroke risk in a large-scale meta-analysis (CHARGE consortium) (Ikram et al. 2009). To replicate the reported associations with NINJ2, a logistic regression model was conducted under an additive genetic assumption to obtain beta coefficients (and odds ratios) and 95% confidence intervals after adjusting the same set of covariates described above. We first tested whether the two SNPs previously reported by CHARGE (rs12425791 and rs11833579) were associated with young-onset stroke in our sample. Because of our a priori hypothesis that each SNP would be associated with young-onset IS, we did not adjust for multiple comparisons in this analysis (\xce\xb1 = 0.05). We also conducted an agnostic screening of all genotyped/imputed SNPs located within NINJ2 to identify the most-significant SNP from the gene based on empirical P values to control for the number of SNPs tested. Empirical P values for the most-significant SNPs were obtained by permuting the case/control status 1000 times to obtain the null distribution of the maximum T statistics (over all SNPs within the gene) and calculating the number of times the maximum test statistics exceeded the observed test statistic. Analyses were conducted using a set-based permutation procedure implemented in PLINK 1.07 (Purcell et al. 2007). A total of 1816 GEOS study participants, including 889 cases and 927 controls, were included in the analysis. Characteristics of study participants are summarized in Table 2. The mean age was 41.3 years for cases and 39.6 years for controls (P < 0.001). The population is primarily composed of two self-reported race groups, white (54.5%) and African American (40.4%), with the remaining 5.1% of individuals comprising other races, including Chinese, Japanese, other Asians, and other unspecified. There were more males than females among both cases and controls. Cases were more likely than controls to report having prevalent hypertension, diabetes, and myocardial infarction and to being current smokers. Results from the GWA analysis are summarized in Figure 1. The genomic inflation factor was 1.01, indicating that the distribution of observed P values across most of the genome was consistent with that expected under the null hypothesis. The 10 most strongly associated SNPs are listed in Table 3. No single SNP reached genome-wide significance (\xce\xb1 = 5.0 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x928). However, we found SNPs, rs2304556 (P = 1.2 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927) and rs1986743 (P = 2.7 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927) located on chromosome 2q23.3, that were associated with IS but not at genome-wide significance (P < 5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x928). These two SNPs are separated by 113 kb and are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) in EA (D\xe2\x80\xb2 = 0.90, r2 = 0.75) although not in AA participants (D\xe2\x80\xb2 = 0.35, r2 = 0.08) in our data [see Figure 2 for regional association plots for EA and AA obtained with the SNAP program (Johnson et al. 2008)]. The estimated OR for both SNPs was 0.69 (95% CI = 0.60\xe2\x80\x930.79) per copy of the minor allele (Table 3). The minor alleles of the two SNPs were more common in controls than cases and more common in AA than EA populations. The effects of the minor allele on risk of IS are similar between EA and AA populations for rs2304556 (OR= 0.71, P = 0.00077 in EA and OR = 0.71, P = 0.0015 in AA, allele G) and for rs1986743 (OR= 0.68, P = 0.0002 in EA and OR = 0.73, P = 0.006 in AA, allele A). After adjusting for the effect of rs2304556, the effect of rs1986743 became nonsignificant in EA (OR = 0.72, P = 0.11) and borderline significant in AA (OR = 0.79, P = 0.06). Additionally, we reexamined the associations of the two SNPs by further adjustment for prior history of MI, hypertension, diabetes and for current smoking, and the effects of the two SNPs remained similar (rs2304556: OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.59\xe2\x88\xbc0.79; P = 1.9 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927; rs1986743: OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.61\xe2\x88\xbc0.82; P = 3.6 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x926). rs2304556 is in the intron of FMNL2, which encodes a formin-related protein, and rs1986743 is in the intron of ARL6IP6, which encodes ADP-ribosylation-like factor 6 interacting protein 6. The cluster plots of both SNPs (rs2304556 and rs1986743) also showed clear separation of the three genotypes, indicating good clustering of genotype calls for the two SNPs (see Figure S2). Most of the other top-associated SNPs were located in intergenic regions, except rs9465922 in an intron of CDKAL1 and rs16834810 in an intron of RYR2.

Each diamond represents a single typed SNP, and each square represents a single imputed SNP. The color within each square/diamond represents the extent of LD correlation, r2, between the SNP and rs2304556. The blue line represents the recombination rate. Recombination rate and r2 were estimated based on HapMap3 CEU and YRI samples, respectively. Regional association plots were drawn by modifying the R program codes from the SNAP program, and the position of the gene were obtained from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser. No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance in ethnic group\xe2\x80\x93specific analyses (data not shown). In the EA population, the SNP most strongly associated with IS was rs2242878 at RUNX1 (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.42\xe2\x80\x932.31, P = 1.8 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x926, T allele), but this SNP was not significantly associated with IS in the AA population (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.55\xe2\x80\x931.65, P = 0.87). Similarly, the SNP most strongly associated with IS in AAs was rs9604365 near SOX1 (OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.40\xe2\x80\x932.17, P = 8.1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927, allele G), but this SNP was not associated with IS in EA (OR= 1.15, 95% CI = 0.77\xe2\x80\x931.72, P = 0.5). It should be noted that rs9604365 was the tenth most significant SNP based on the overall population results (see Table 3). We further analyzed the genome-wide associations stratified by each stroke subtype defined by TOAST criteria, including cardioembolic, large artery, lacunar subtypes, other known causes, and other undetermined causes. No SNPs were associated with any of the stroke subtypes at genome-wide levels of statistical significance, although the power to detect associations for subtypes was very modest. Summary results showing all SNPs associated with any stroke subtype at P < 1.0 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x925 in combined analyses of EA and AA are provided in Table S1. Neither rs2304556 nor rs1986743, the two SNPs most strongly associated with overall stroke in our sample, showed subtype-specific patterns of association; i.e., the associations for both SNPs were approximately consistent across all stroke subtypes (ORs ranged 0.52\xe2\x80\x930.76 for rs2304556 and 0.57\xe2\x80\x930.73 for rs1986743) (Table S2). There are currently no other large cohorts of young-onset stroke for which to attempt replication. We did, however, assess the association of rs2304556, our peak SNP, with IS in two independent Caucasian cohorts with older-onset stroke: the Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study and Siblings with Ischemic Stroke Studies (ISGS/SWISS; n = 1070 cases and 1488 controls) and the Genes Affecting Stroke Risk and Outcomes Study (GASROS; n = 516 cases and 1202 controls). There was no evidence for association with IS in either cohort (OR = 1.10, P = 0.12 in ISGS/SWISS and OR = 0.95, P = 0.63 in GASROS for minor allele G). These cohorts had 80% power to detect odds ratios as low as 1.21 (ISGS/SWISS) and 1.26 (GASROS) for this SNP. We additionally tested whether SNPs from NINJ2, which was identified in a prior large GWAS study to be associated with IS, were associated with young-onset stroke in our study (Table 4). Of the two SNPs near NINJ2 that were previously reported to be associated with IS (Ikram et al. 2009), neither was associated with early-onset IS in our samples (rs11833579, combined P = 0.54, EA P = 0.99, AA P = 0.76; and rs12425791, combined P = 0.49, EA P = 0.74, AA P = 0.91). None of the other SNPs from NINJ2 was significantly associated with stroke risk in EA and AA populations after controlling for the number of SNPs analyzed within the gene. When further investigating the NINJ2 associations by TOAST subtypes, none of the SNPs was significantly associated with any of the stroke subtype, either (data not shown). The GEOS Study is the largest genetics study of young-onset stroke carried out to date. Despite having 80% power to detect odds ratios of 1.55\xe2\x80\x932.30 (at allele frequencies 10\xe2\x80\x9350%), we had limited power (<70%) to detect odds ratio less than 1.5 and failed to identify associations with SNPs meeting conventional genome-wide levels of significance. However, we did detect associations with two SNPs on chromosome 2q associated with overall IS that achieved nearly genome-wide levels of significance (P < 2.65 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927). The most strongly associated SNPs were near FMNL2 on chromosome 2. The minor allele of this SNP (rs2304556), which is located in the intron of FMNL2, is associated with an approximately 31% decrease in risk per copy of minor allele in both EA and AA populations. A similar association with stroke risk was observed for a nearby SNP, rs1986743, located on ARL6IP6, although the strength of association for this SNP diminished substantially after adjusting for rs2304556, suggesting the two SNPs may not represent independent signals. As there are no other large studies of young strokes currently available for replication, we sought replication in two other cohorts with older strokes (ISGS and GASROS). Although we were unable to replicate the associations of the chromosome 2 SNPs in other Caucasian cohorts, the lack of replications may be due to the genetic heterogeneity possibility between younger vs. older strokes. FMNL2, which encodes formin-like 2 protein, is involved in actin-dependent processes and is implicated in cell motility and invasion (Kitzing et al. 2010). Although the function of this gene is largely unknown, the gene is highly expressed in the brain and other central/peripheral nervous system tissues (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Research/genentech/genehub-gepis/index.html) (Gardberg et al. 2010) and is conserved in different species (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/homologene). A microdeletion on chromosome 2q region involving FMNL2 has previously been implicated in mental retardation (Lyb\xc3\xa6k et al. 2009), and association and linkage studies have implicated this same chromosomal region with susceptibility to autism (Imgsac. 2001; Maestrini et al. 2009). The function of ARL6IP6 is currently unknown. Replication studies, particularly in young stroke cases, are required to assess the role of rs2304556 and/or other variants in and around FMNL2 with young-onset stroke. Interestingly, our GWAS also showed CDKAL1, a gene previously shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Scott et al. 2007; Zeggini et al. 2007), to be marginally associated with IS in our data. T2D is a strong risk factor for stroke. However, the association between rs9465922 and IS remained highly significant after adjusting for self-reported diabetes status in our population (OR = 0.55, 95% = 0.44\xe2\x80\x930.70, P = 5.5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927), suggesting the effect of this gene on IS may be independent of the effect of T2D. The function of CDKAL1 is not currently known, although the association of this gene to T2D may be related to an effect of the associated SNP on insulin response (Steinthorsdottir et al. 2007). We were unable to replicate the previous GWA associations with two SNPs in NINJ2 as reported by the CHARGE consortium (Ikram et al. 2009), even though power was 98% in our sample to detect associations of the magnitude of that observed in CHARGE (OR = 1.39\xe2\x80\x931.41 for SNPs with these allele frequencies). Notably, the association with NINJ2 reported in CHARGE could also not be replicated in a recent very large meta-analysis by the International Stroke Genetics Consortium and Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium 2 (2010). We used the strategy of studying the early-onset form of IS to identify genetic variants associated with this complex disease because the early-onset form may be less susceptible to the influence of environmental exposures, and genetic components could potentially have a greater contribution to disease risk. Although it is possible that genetic variants associated with early-onset stroke may have little relevance to late-onset stroke, it is also possible that studying early-onset form of diseases may reveal important insights about stroke pathogenesis, even implicating key genes and pathways relevant to late-onset disease even though the responsible variants may differ. Although we did identify a region on chromosome 2 with suggestive evidence for association in the GEOS population, we did not identify any variants reaching conventional thresholds for statistical significance at a genome-wide level. The absence of robust associations may be due to the limited sample size that provided insufficient power to detect causal variants with small effect sizes (e.g. less than 80% power to detect genetic risk effect less than 1.55). Alternatively, one can argue that the early-onset form of IS may be more likely to be caused by rare variants with larger effects (and higher penetrance). Such rare variants are generally not well covered on currently available genotyping platforms and, thus, would be difficult to detect through a GWA approach. Exome and/or whole-genome sequencing may be a promising research approach to pursue the roles of these infrequent and highly penetrant variants on IS risk. Notably, our ability to identify IS-associated variants could be further limited by the stroke phenotype itself, which is composed of several heterogeneous subtypes with different underlying causes and potentially different genetic dispositions (Marnane et al. 2010). Thus, the genetic variants contributing to stroke risk may differ based upon stroke subtype. Although we analyzed according to TOAST subtype, in doing so we incurred further losses in power due to the smaller number of cases available in each subtype. As IS occurs infrequently before age 50, it is difficult for a single study to obtain the sufficient number of strokes necessary to power subtype-specific analyses. Therefore, combining genetic data among multiple early-onset stroke studies to increase the number of cases for overall stroke and stroke subtype analyses will be essential to ensure sufficient power to detect causal variants with moderate effects. Our early-onset IS GWA study identified a novel IS susceptibility region around FMNL2 on chromosome 2q. Further studies in other young-stroke populations are needed to replicate these findings and to evaluate the associations between these SNPs and the more common older-onset form of stroke. Meta-analysis of early-onset stroke ensuring sufficient statistical power for moderate genetic effects and sequencing efforts to explore the effect of rare variants are also required.

Ciliates rely on a remarkable process of whole-genome remodeling by DNA elimination to differentiate an expressed macronucleus (MAC) from a copy of the germline micronucleus (MIC) in each cycle of sexual reproduction. Here we describe results from the first high-throughput sequencing effort to investigate ciliate genome restructuring, comparing Sanger long-read sequences from a Tetrahymena thermophila MIC genome library to the MAC genome assembly. With almost 25% coverage of the unique-sequence MAC genome by MIC genome sequence reads, we created a resource for positional analysis of MIC-specific DNA removal that pinpoints MAC genome sites of DNA elimination at nucleotide resolution. The widespread distribution of internal eliminated sequences (IES) in promoter regions and introns suggests that MAC genome restructuring is essential not only for what it removes (for example, active transposons) but also for what it creates (for example, splicing-competent introns). Consistent with the heterogeneous boundaries and epigenetically modulated efficiency of individual IES deletions studied to date, we find that IES sites are dramatically under-represented in the \xe2\x88\xbc25% of the MAC genome encoding exons. As an exception to this general rule, we discovered a previously unknown class of small (<500 bp) IES with precise elimination boundaries that can contribute the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 exon of an mRNA expressed during genome restructuring, providing a new mechanism for expanding mRNA complexity in a developmentally regulated manner.Regulated genome rearrangements are an evolutionarily widespread mechanism for affecting changes in gene expression, for example, switching cell mating type, alternating surface protein presentation, or expanding the repertoire of antibody production (Rusche and Rine 2010). More extreme cases of genome remodeling by large-scale chromatin diminution have been demonstrated in diverse eukaryotes, including ciliated protozoa, parasitic nematodes, and hagfish (Kloc and Zagrodzinska 2001). In the entire phylum Ciliata, a transcriptionally active MAC is differentiated from a copy of the germline MIC by elimination of repetitive DNA (Karrer 2000; Duharcourt et al. 2009). This process is proposed to accomplish a defense of the phenotypically expressed genome from the influence of foreign DNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, repetitive DNA elimination in ciliates involves the same process of RNA-guided heterochromatin formation required for transposon silencing in other eukaryotes (Mochizuki and Gorovsky 2004; Yao and Chao 2005; Chalker 2008). Knowledge of how the MAC and MIC differ is fundamental to understanding the evolutionarily success of ciliates as well as for enabling studies of the chromosome structures that support meiosis and mitosis (MIC chromosomes) or chromosome segregation without classic heterochromatin (MAC chromosomes). Among the ciliates, Tetrahymena thermophila has been a favorable model organism for discoveries of fundamental eukaryotic biology (Collins and Gorovsky 2005). The \xe2\x88\xbc104 Mbp MAC genome of T. thermophila has been sequenced and annotated, revealing a complexity of gene families comparable to that in multicellular organisms (Eisen et al. 2006; Coyne et al. 2008). Genome-scale analysis of a ciliate MIC has not yet been described. Reassociation kinetics and quantitative DNA staining methods estimate T. thermophila MIC genome complexity as 10\xe2\x80\x9320% greater than that of the MAC (Yao and Gorovsky 1974; Gorovsky 1980), but only a handful of MIC-specific elements, known as IES, have been characterized. IES are removed from the genome of the developing MAC en masse in a period of only a few hours during the sexual process of conjugation (Yao and Chao 2005; Chalker 2008). Extrapolation from the frequency of IES detection by differential restriction fragment mobility of MIC vs. MAC DNA, based on Southern blots of a few randomly selected genome regions (Yao et al. 1984), suggests a number of \xe2\x88\xbc6,000 MAC genome sites of IES removal. Many sequenced IES appear to be noncoding, whereas others carry ORFs related to transposon-encoded genes (Yao and Chao 2005; Chalker 2008). No known T. thermophila IES interrupts a protein-coding open reading frame (ORF), although the much shorter IES of Paramecium tetraurelia that lack epigenetic modulation of excision frequently do (Duret et al. 2008). Enabled by a Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Community Sequencing Project, we used high-throughput T. thermophila MIC genome sequencing to initiate the genome-scale investigation of nuclear differentiation from MIC to MAC. By aligning MIC genome Sanger sequence reads to the set of assembled MAC contigs in a manner refined for pinpointing positions of DNA elimination, we created a community resource for IES investigation. Although IES are dramatically depleted in the \xe2\x88\xbc25% of the MAC genome predicted to contain exons with ORF, as an exception, we show that one member of a new class of short IES provides an exon that changes the mRNA 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of a protein expressed during genome restructuring. The demonstration that an IES can provide an exon cassette establishes a new mechanism for increasing ciliate mRNA complexity in a developmentally regulated manner.'","b'Genetically programmed DNA rearrangements can regulate mRNA expression at an individual locus or, for some organisms, on a genome-wide scale. Ciliates rely on a remarkable process of whole-genome remodeling by DNA elimination to differentiate an expressed macronucleus (MAC) from a copy of the germline micronucleus (MIC) in each cycle of sexual reproduction. Here we describe results from the first high-throughput sequencing effort to investigate ciliate genome restructuring, comparing Sanger long-read sequences from a Tetrahymena thermophila MIC genome library to the MAC genome assembly. With almost 25% coverage of the unique-sequence MAC genome by MIC genome sequence reads, we created a resource for positional analysis of MIC-specific DNA removal that pinpoints MAC genome sites of DNA elimination at nucleotide resolution. The widespread distribution of internal eliminated sequences (IES) in promoter regions and introns suggests that MAC genome restructuring is essential not only for what it removes (for example, active transposons) but also for what it creates (for example, splicing-competent introns). Consistent with the heterogeneous boundaries and epigenetically modulated efficiency of individual IES deletions studied to date, we find that IES sites are dramatically under-represented in the \xe2\x88\xbc25% of the MAC genome encoding exons.

The demonstration that an IES can provide an exon cassette establishes a new mechanism for increasing ciliate mRNA complexity in a developmentally regulated manner. Nuclei were purified from the inbred T. thermophila strain SB210 used previously in the MAC genome project, with homozygous MIC allele content. MIC isolation from MAC was performed by differential centrifugation (White et al. 1988). MAC contamination of the MIC preparation was estimated by nuclei counts as \xe2\x88\xbc0.1%, which adjusting for differential DNA content corresponds to a mass contamination of 1\xe2\x80\x932%. Total cellular DNA was used for PCR assays and total cellular RNA was used for Northern blots. Primers are listed in supporting information, Table S1. Northern blots used hexamer-primed radiolabeled probes synthesized from double-stranded DNA templates. Paired-end (b1/g1) reads from an \xe2\x88\xbc8 kbp MIC DNA fragment library in pMCL are available from the NCBI trace archives (Project ID 32845). After vector sequence removal, reads were retrimmed for average qualities at least Q20 and aligned using BWA-SW default settings (bio-bwa.sourceforge.net). Read segments were designated by alignment order as aln1, aln2, etc. If more than 10 bp did not align from one side of the read only, the alignment was segregated to a separate browser track as a candidate indicator of IES position. Fully mapping and one-sided-mapping reads that could align at more than one MAC genome location were segregated to a separate set of multimapper browser tracks. MIC library reads were aligned to a concatenation of MAC genome contigs ordered by decreasing size. This reference genome contains 103,002,206 bp of T. thermophila MAC genome project sequence with 10 kbp blocks of N added between contigs, for a total of 114,482,206 bp. Browser track annotation of candidate IES sites allowed no more than 9 bp of overlap between the MAC-matching portions of convergent L and R reads (described below). The mapped sequence reads, IES annotations, previously predicted T. thermophila genes (indicated by TTHERM number), and their individual predicted exons (Coyne et al. 2008) are aligned in an open-access community resource with the UCSC genome browser format (gb.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu, clade Alveolata, genome T. thermophila, Sep 2009 assembly). Previous shotgun sequencing and assembly of the T. thermophila MAC used paired-end Sanger reads from 2\xe2\x80\x936 kbp DNA fragment libraries (Eisen et al. 2006). In pilot Sanger sequencing trials of MIC genome libraries, an \xe2\x88\xbc8 kbp insert DNA library was the maximal insert size to give a high yield of validated reads. However, high-throughput sequencing of this MIC genome library did not yield the expected genome coverage of high-quality sequence reads, suggesting some destabilization of the 8 kbp insert library from the \xe2\x88\xbc75% AT bias of the T. thermophila genomes (Yao and Gorovsky 1974). Extensively quality-filtered sequence reads were aligned to a concatenated assembly of MAC genome contigs ordered from the largest to smallest in size, termed the conMAC. The smallest MAC chromosome, encoding only ribosomal RNA, was omitted, as was the mitochondrial chromosome. The conMAC arrangement of the reference genome has the benefit of segregating the expected MIC contamination of the MAC genome assemblies, present in small scaffolds of generally low-sequence coverage (Coyne et al. 2008), to the right edge of the reference genome representation (gb.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu, clade Alveolata, genome T. thermophila, Sep 2009 assembly; see Figure 1 for genome browser track displays and annotations). The MAC contains some repetitive sequences, including RNA-coding, protein-coding, and noncoding genome segments (Eisen et al. 2006). Therefore, we segregated MIC genome sequence reads that aligned at multiple MAC locations to browser tracks separate from the uniquely aligning reads. The uniquely mapping MIC genome reads aligned to 22,339,139 bp of the MAC genome sequence, approaching 25% coverage of the unique-sequence fraction of the MAC genome. Annotation of MAC positions of IES excision. (A) A representative high-confidence win1 IES site prediction in the MAC genome. The candidate IES site (IES D) falls within an internal exon of the gene model for TTHERM_00198180, which is displayed in its entirety (see scale bar at top). The genome browser track \xe2\x80\x9cPutative IES sites using uniquely mapped Sanger reads\xe2\x80\x9d indicates positions of the win1, win2, and win3 IES predictions described in the text. The track \xe2\x80\x9cSanger Reads Left (unique)\xe2\x80\x9d shows the extent of MAC-matching sequence within a MIC genome read that maps to the MAC with its left end but has a nonmapping sequence on its right end; the read matched a unique MAC sequence, in contrast to reads segregated to the track \xe2\x80\x9cSanger Reads Left (multi).\xe2\x80\x9d The track \xe2\x80\x9cSanger Reads Right (unique)\xe2\x80\x9d shows the extent of MAC-matching sequence within a MIC genome read that maps to the MAC with its right end but has a nonmapping sequence on its left end; the read matched a unique MAC sequence, in contrast to reads segregated to the track \xe2\x80\x9cSanger Reads Right (multi).\xe2\x80\x9d The tracks \xe2\x80\x9cSanger Reads Fully Mapped\xe2\x80\x9d show read alignments that matched the MAC without a left-end-only or right-end-only extension of nonmapping sequence. (B) Widespread MAC chromosome distribution of IES sites predicted from Sanger L and/or R read alignments. Note that the conMAC region containing the smallest MAC genome contigs at right is also overrepresented in the 10 kbp spacer blocks of N that were added between contigs; therefore, the bp amount of MAC assembly in this region is exaggerated as a proportion of conMAC length. The upper track shows the entire conMAC assembly of MAC genome contigs joined in order of decreasing length; in the browser, this track is designated as the fakeasome. We exploited the relatively long Sanger read lengths for an alignment-based strategy of defining MAC genome positions of IES excision. Because known T. thermophila IES are longer than a Sanger read length, we expected some MIC library reads to align to the MAC genome at one end only, with the remaining nonmapping read extension continuing into an IES. Therefore, reads that aligned to the MAC were sorted into three categories of mapping specificity: reads fully aligned to the MAC (50,057), reads with some internal discontinuity or mismatch that could have resulted from cloned DNA rearrangement (27,002), and reads aligned to the MAC from one end only with a nonmapping >10 bp terminal extension at the other end (12,037; File S1). Reads that mapped with one end only but were at scaffold edges (File S2) were excluded from the one-end-mapper reads used for IES annotation. Nonmapping reads that did not align over any of the read length were also obtained, potentially representing MIC-specific DNA content (File S3). We used the Sanger reads that aligned to MAC genome sequence with one end only to define candidate MAC genome positions of IES. Of these reads, 5736 aligned on the browser left side of a putative IES (L alignments), and 6301 aligned on the browser right side of a putative IES (R alignments). Because reads capable of alignment with repetitive MAC sequences can falsely suggest IES by aligning elsewhere from their locus of origin, we segregated the reads that did not map uniquely to separate browser tracks. Considering only the uniquely mapping L and R reads, we identified 3251 MAC genome locations as candidate IES positions based on the criteria of (1) departure of an L and/or R read from MAC-mapping sequence, (2) no more than 9 bp of overlap between the MAC-mapping portions of convergent L and R read sequences (allowing for up to 9 bp of IES-flanking microhomology), and (3) no read mapping to the MAC across the putative IES location (which would be evidence against IES interruption of the MAC genome). We binned these putative IES positions as one of three window (win) designations: (1) IES positions implicated by converging L and R alignments with terminal MAC-matching positions separated by no more than 9 bp (win1 category, 404 sites), (2) IES positions implicated by L alignment(s) only (win2 category, 1378 sites), or (3) R alignment(s) only (win3 category, 1469 sites). Figure 1A shows a win1 category IES site prediction (shown for IES candidate D, described below). Some win2 and win3 category IES site predictions could be artifacts of sequence rearrangement within the library of cloned MIC genomic DNA fragments, but the convergent L and R alignments of the win1 category should pinpoint IES positions with high confidence and at nucleotide resolution. Assuming that the \xe2\x88\xbc25% coverage of the MAC genome by MIC genome sequence reads is randomly distributed, any given MAC genome position of IES excision would have a slightly less than 25% probability of coverage by an L read and the same probability of coverage by an R read. Therefore, as a rough calculation, we would expect to have defined somewhat less than 1/16th of the total number of IES positions with the high-confidence win1 predictions. Given the total of 404 win1 category annotations, our extrapolation for a genome-wide tally of IES excision sites modestly exceeds the \xe2\x88\xbc6,000 sites predicted from a small sampling of loci for differential MAC and MIC restriction fragment sizes (Yao et al. 1984). We first examined the distribution of predicted IES positions across MAC chromosomes. On a genome-wide scale (Figure 1B), IES positions are widely interspersed across the MAC genome. We next considered whether there was a bias to IES positions at a more local level, for example, with respect to protein-coding regions of the genome. Considering the inventory of \xe2\x88\xbc25,000 predicted MAC protein-coding genes and an average of \xe2\x88\xbc1000 nt per mRNA (Calzone et al. 1983a; Coyne et al. 2008), segments of protein-coding ORF would account for almost 25% of the MAC genome sequence. T. thermophila mRNAs include an average of 3.6 introns per gene (Coyne et al. 2008), with typically short intron and untranslated region lengths of \xe2\x88\xbc150 nt, bringing the total sequence transcribed by RNA polymerase II to \xe2\x88\xbc50% of the MAC genome. Hybridization measurements of transcript complexity support the conclusion that more than half of the MAC genome is transcribed and that more than half of the nuclear RNA complexity is represented in translated mRNA (Calzone et al. 1983b). Therefore, if IES positions are random with respect to MAC genome context, almost 25% of IES should interrupt a protein-coding ORF. We sought to identify candidate exon-interrupting IES using two approaches. First, all of the high-confidence win1 category predictions of IES positions that were informatically determined to overlap predicted exons were examined manually for the validity of the gene and exon models. Candidates were excluded from further evaluation if they fell within exons of improbable gene models; for example, genes composed of a tiny exon and/or with the atypically long introns that were initially overpredicted by automated gene annotation (Coyne et al. 2008). Second, within the first 16,026,800 bp (>10%) of the conMAC containing the largest, telomere-to-telomere assembled MAC chromosomes, we manually surveyed candidate IES positions implicated by L-only or R-only alignments for overlap with an exon of a predicted gene. The overwhelming majority of candidate IES positions were intergenic or within an intron, consistent with the MAC genome context of the T. thermophila IES characterized to date. For predicted exon-interrupting IES positions, close examination usually revealed that the putative exon was part of an improbable gene model. The limited number of exceptions was investigated as described below. Following the analysis above, we retained 10 potentially reasonable predictions for putative IES that would excise from the MAC genome context of an exon (Table 1). The top three candidates (IES 1\xe2\x80\x933) met all of the selection criteria: high-confidence IES prediction by convergent L and R reads, expressed sequence tag (Coyne et al. 2008) and microarray-based (Miao et al. 2009) evidence for locus transcription (either indicated in Table 1 as \xe2\x80\x9ce\xe2\x80\x9d for Gene \xe2\x80\x9cexpression\xe2\x80\x9d), and Tetrahymena Genome Database annotation of at least one functional domain in the predicted gene product (indicated in Table 1 as \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d for Gene \xe2\x80\x9cannotation\xe2\x80\x9d). Seven additional candidates (IES A\xe2\x80\x93G) met a subset of these criteria (Table 1). Importantly, these IES were also supported by the presence of the same sequence of nonmapping extensions adjacent to the MAC-aligned read segment of each L or R read; this extension provided some or all of the IES sequence. Remarkably, for four of the candidate IES (1-2 and A-B), a complete IES sequence was possible to determine by comparison of the full-length Sanger sequence reads with each other and the MAC genome (File S4). Each of these IES was shorter than all previously characterized T. thermophila IES (<500 bp; Table 1, under \xe2\x80\x9cIES Length\xe2\x80\x9d), with 3\xe2\x80\x934 bp of microhomology flanking the IES that was retained in single copy in the MAC genome (Table 1, under \xe2\x80\x9cMAC Junction\xe2\x80\x9d). All four IES include a TA dinucleotide within the microhomology, and three of the four have the complete TTAA motif that is efficiently cleaved by a domesticated piggyBac transposase-like protein essential for conjugation in T. thermophila and P. tetraurelia (Baudry et al. 2009; Cheng et al. 2010). For the other candidate IES, a comparison of the MIC genome sequence reads with the assembled MAC revealed no or variable sequences of IES-flanking microhomology (Table 1). Lack of a specific IES-flanking sequence motif is thought to be typical in T. thermophila, as is the heterogeneity of MAC junctions created by IES excision (Yao et al. 2003; Howard-Till and Yao 2007). We suggest that the excision of different IES types could proceed by the action of different enzymes or involve different enzyme-associated factors, accounting for conservation of the TTAA motif at the boundaries of the new class of short IES but not at the boundaries of other, potentially more epigenetically regulated IES. To confirm the presence of the predicted IES with an independent approach, we used IES-flanking primers for PCR. As PCR templates, we prepared total DNA (MAC+MIC) from the sequenced inbred T. thermophila strain SB210 and two other MIC-homozygous inbred strains, CU428 and B2086. Initial PCR reactions were performed with primers containing MAC-destined sequences flanking the site of IES removal, which would amplify both the MAC genome junction following IES removal and, if suitably limited in length, the MIC genome IES-containing DNA as well (Figure 2, main panels and schematic at right). Additional PCR reactions were performed using one primer that spanned from MAC-destined to MIC-specific DNA and/or was entirely within the IES, designed using the nonmapping sequence extensions of the reads giving L and R alignments (Figure 2, small panels and schematics below the main panels). Because many IES are repetitive elements within the MIC genome, PCR using two entirely IES-internal primers was avoided; such reactions have the potential to amplify products from IES other than the intended MIC genome locus. IES validation by PCR. Genomic DNA isolated from strain SB210, CU428, or B2086 was amplified by PCR using primers flanking the putative IES site in MAC-destined DNA, as schematized at right. PCR products are visualized here as the negative image of an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The smaller panels below the main panels for IES 2, A, and E show IES-specific PCR amplification using primer(s) that overlap or are internal to the IES, as also schematized. Relevant DNA standards are indicated. Expected MAC genome amplification products are labeled with \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d; IES-containing PCR products are labeled with \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d; note that IES size could be underestimated for IES C, D, and E if the IES contains internal repeat(s). The inbred strains SB210, CU428, and B2086 were generated from independent sexual progeny and thus could differ in the MAC genome junctions created by IES removal. For most of the candidate IES, including all four of the entirely sequenced small IES (1-2 and A-B), PCR using MAC-destined sequence primers flanking the IES produced the same size of predominant amplification product from the MAC genomes of all three strains (Figure 2, designated by \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d). However, the MAC junction product for IES F was shorter in length in CU428 than in SB210 and not detectable in B2086, whereas the MAC junction product for IES G was longer in length in CU428 than in SB210 or B2086. The MAC junction product for IES C also appeared heterogeneous. Importantly, for some amplification reactions, a unique lower-abundance product of substantially longer length than the expected MAC genome amplification product could also be detected (Figure 2, designated by \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d). For cases in which a longer product was amplified with questionable specificity, we used one primer that included the MAC-destined sequence and a second primer that included the IES sequence to amplify a MIC genome product without competition from the MAC genome product (Figure 2, lower panels). Many PCR primer sequences and combinations were used to confirm a reliable IES length for the new class of <500 bp IES (IES 1-2 and A-B) and for other IES of modest length up to \xe2\x88\xbc2 kbp (IES C\xe2\x80\x93E); however, repeated attempts to determine the length of IES 3, F, and G were unsuccessful (Table 1). Next, for the IES that could be amplified by PCR, we tested the genetic requirements for IES excision. Homokaryon gene knockout strains were mated that lacked the conjugation-essential enzyme Dicer-like 1 (DCL1), an IES-associated chromodomain protein (PDD1), or an additional factor (LIA1) required for IES excision (Coyne et al. 1999; Malone et al. 2005; Mochizuki and Gorovsky 2005; Rexer and Chalker 2007). Total DNA was purified from polyclonal populations of cells arrested without completing conjugation and compared with total DNA from strain SB210 in asexual vegetative growth. All of the IES appeared more abundant in conjugation-arrested cells, detected as an increase in the amplification of the IES-containing PCR product (Figure 3, designated by \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d). We conclude that removal of even the smallest known T. thermophila IES is directly or indirectly dependent on RNA-guided heterochromatin formation. Heterogeneous boundaries for removal of IES C were evident by PCR (Figures 2 and 3) and verified by sequencing of cloned junction amplification products (Figure 4). Thus, sequencing of MAC genomes from inbred strains other than SB210 could allow the discovery of IES sites through sequence heterogeneity at the MAC junctions of IES removal. IES excision requirements. For each IES, PCR was done with the schematized primer pairs using genomic DNA isolated from the strain SB210 in vegetative growth or from the polyclonal pool of cells arrested 28 hr after initiation of conjugation for gene knockout strains lacking DCL1, PDD1, or LIA1. PCR products are visualized as the negative image of an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. DNA standard lanes have the 500 bp marker denoted with \xe2\x80\x9co\xe2\x80\x9d; expected MAC genome amplification products are labeled with \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d; and IES-containing PCR products are labeled with \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d (these labels are included in a subset of adjacent gel lanes for clarity). Sequence alignment of MAC junctions resulting from removal of IES C. A multiple sequence alignment is shown for cloned MAC junctions resulting from the removal of IES C, which together have three lengths and four distinct sequences. Clones were sequenced for junctions amplified from DNA of the inbred strains B2086, CU428, and SB210 (lines 1\xe2\x80\x933) or amplified from the DNA of noninbred strain crosses used in Figure 3 (lines 4\xe2\x80\x935; conj1 and conj2 indicate the two distinct sequences obtained from many cloned DNA fragment sequences). Below the alignment, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d indicates the region of consensus sequence. T. thermophila gene predictions include divergent, nonfunctional paralogs of productive genes, and as a likely consequence, some predicted genes are not detectably expressed in any lifecycle stage evaluated by EST identification or microarray hybridization (Coyne et al. 2008; Miao et al. 2009). Conversely, microarray or even EST evidence for locus expression is not certain evidence of a productive mRNA, particularly for data collected from conjugating cells with nongenic transcription. Therefore, we used Northern blot hybridization of total RNA to investigate whether putative exons flanking the six shortest, confirmed IES (IES 1-2 and A-D) were incorporated into discrete, biologically stable mRNAs. We analyzed total RNA from vegetatively growing cells and a conjugation time course extending through the interval of IES excision in the newly differentiating MAC genome (0\xe2\x80\x9312 hr). No specific Northern blot hybridization signal was detected using probes containing the predicted mRNA region 5\xe2\x80\xb2 of IES 1, 2, or D, but probes for the regions flanking IES A, B, and C detected at least a heterogeneous smear of conjugation-specific nongenic RNA, predominantly less than 500 nucleotides (nt) in length (Figure 5A). This nongenic transcription promotes IES assembly into heterochromatin (Chalker and Yao 2001). At least for IES A, B, and C, nongenic transcription must extend far enough into the IES-flanking region to be detectable by hybridization with a probe containing an entirely MAC-destined sequence. No discrete mRNA was detected for the putative host gene of IES A. IES host gene expression. (A) Total RNA was isolated from strain SB210 in asexual vegetative growth (V) or at the indicated times after initiation of conjugation using strains SB210 and CU428 (in hours). Northern blot hybridization was performed to detect the putative mRNA region adjacent to the indicated IES. Blots are shown in size register; nonspecific signal left from a previous probing of the same membrane is indicated by \xe2\x80\x9cNS.\xe2\x80\x9d (B) Transcripts from the region of the LIA2 locus hosting IES B were isolated by RT-PCR and sequenced. Boxes denote exons, and thick lines denote introns or untranslated regions. Gray boxes and solid lines indicate MAC-destined sequence, and the open box and dashed line indicate IES. Translation termination codons (TGA) and positions of mRNA polyadenylation (pA) are shown. The host gene of IES C differs from the other nine putative IES host genes in having a microarray expression profile peak in vegetatively growing cells, albeit with low signal intensity, and no detectable expression in conjugating cells. Correspondingly, Northern blot hybridization revealed a discrete >2,000 nt transcript that was most abundant in vegetatively growing cells (Figure 5A, IES C locus). Some of this transcript was also detectable in the starved cells that were mixed to initiate conjugation (time zero of the conjugation time course) and that remained as a fraction of the cells collected at all conjugation time points. Despite readily detectable mRNA production from the IES C host gene, RT-PCR attempts failed to detect the inclusion of the IES C sequence in a polyadenylated mRNA transcript. At least two discrete forms of mRNA were detected for the host gene of IES B amid the extensive background of nongenic transcript hybridization (Figure 5A, IES B locus). The host gene of IES B encodes the helicase-domain protein Lia2, which a previous study (Yao et al. 2007) and our Northern blot analysis (Figure 5A) concur in detecting with conjugation-specific expression. Curiously, the peaks of mRNA and nongenic RNA expression were largely coincident, and the expression timing of nongenic transcription was shifted slightly later compared with nongenic transcription from the loci of IES A and IES C (Figure 5A). RT-PCR product sequences revealed that IES B was incorporated into polyadenylated mRNA (Figure 5B; see File S5 and GenBank EF219412.1). Remarkably, the primary transcript containing the IES was spliced to remove a portion of the predicted 3\xe2\x80\xb2 exon of the macronuclear LIA2 gene and part of the IES, creating an ORF that directed both translation termination and polyadenylation within the IES (Figure 5B). As a consequence, at least one form of LIA2 mRNA encodes a protein C-terminus translated from within IES B. Whether this mRNA is translated to produce a stably accumulated protein product remains to be established by direct analysis of Lia2 polypeptide(s). The IES-containing LIA2 mRNA would be transcribed in the developing MAC. Thus, it is surprising that nongenic RNA expression from the developing MAC is also readily detected, contemporary with LIA2 mRNA. We suggest that the location of the IES in the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 terminal exon of the host gene (Table 1) may not be coincidental: this location provides maximum physical spacing between the initiation sites of mRNA transcription and nongenic IES transcription, which may reduce their competition. In addition, as a requisite for or result of mRNA expression, nongenic IES transcription may be delayed for the LIA2 locus relative to loci that are not producing an mRNA product in conjugating cells. In conclusion, although IES are clearly depleted from exons on a genome-wide scale, expression of an IES-containing mRNA provides a previously unrecognized mechanism for increasing mRNA complexity in a developmentally regulated manner. By positional identification of MAC genome sites of IES removal, we have created a community resource for IES discovery and characterization. Based on the T. thermophila content of MIC-specific vs. MAC-destined DNA and the estimated number of IES in the MAC genome, an average IES should be on the order of \xe2\x88\xbc2 kbp. However, we suggest that there is not an \xe2\x80\x9caverage\xe2\x80\x9d IES. Instead, a true complexity of IES types seems likely to exist varying in size, sequence complexity, excision boundary precision, sensitivity to epigenetic modulation, and mechanism of elimination. Although the bulk of the MIC-specific sequence should be repetitive elements (Gorovsky 1980; Yao and Chao 2005), the new category of <500 bp IES characterized here could contribute a large number of limited-length unique sequences. IES containing repetitive DNA have functions in germline genome maintenance, for example, providing the specialized chromatin regions necessary for chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis (Cui and Gorovsky 2006). We suggest that other types of IES, for example, the <500 bp IES with precise elimination boundaries established by TTAA motifs, may at least infrequently gain regulatory function by altering the level or sequence of a specific mRNA.

 be restricted to the interval of conjugation subsequent to transcriptional onset and prior to the completion of IES excision in a differentiating MAC. On an individual level, experimentally induced failures of IES excision are not necessarily deleterious for cell survival (Chalker and Yao 1996; Yao and Chao 2005). In contrast, on genomic scale, halting the process of DNA elimination at any of a large number of intermediate steps has precluded the generation of viable sexual progeny (Chalker 2008). Our IES positional analysis suggests that few if any growth-expressed T. thermophila genes have exons interrupted by an IES, but the widespread distribution of IES in promoter regions and introns can account for why global failures of IES excision are incompatible with MAC function. Introns in T. thermophila are of limited length (even less than the length of the new class of short IES characterized in this work), and splice sites and polyadenylation signals have low sequence complexity (Eisen et al. 2006; Coyne et al. 2008). As demonstrated by the example of the LIA2 IES above, inclusion of IES sequence in an mRNA primary transcript would therefore likely trigger additional mRNA splicing and/or premature mRNA polyadenylation. Also, due to high gene density in the T. thermophila MAC (Eisen et al. 2006; Coyne et al. 2008), many intergenic IES are likely to interrupt coordination between the regulatory elements of a transcriptional promoter. Thus, although IES occupy safe-haven locations in the MAC genome in the sense of tolerance for imprecise deletion boundaries, the bulk of IES length would need to be removed to produce a functional organization of many T. thermophila genes.

1,"['Darren Abbey', 'Meleah Hickman', 'David Gresham', 'Judith Berman']","December 8, 2011.",High-Resolution SNP/CGH Microarrays Reveal the Accumulation of Loss of Heterozygosity in Commonly Used Candida albicans Strains,"b'Phenotypic diversity can arise rapidly through loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or by the acquisition of copy number variations (CNV) spanning whole chromosomes or shorter contiguous chromosome segments. In Candida albicans, a heterozygous diploid yeast pathogen with no known meiotic cycle, homozygosis and aneuploidy alter clinical characteristics, including drug resistance. Here, we developed a high-resolution microarray that simultaneously detects \xe2\x88\xbc39,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles and \xe2\x88\xbc20,000 copy number variation loci across the C. albicans genome. An important feature of the array analysis is a computational pipeline that determines SNP allele ratios based upon chromosome copy number. Using the array and analysis tools, we constructed a haplotype map (hapmap) of strain SC5314 to assign SNP alleles to specific homologs, and we used it to follow the acquisition of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number changes in a series of derived laboratory strains. This high-resolution SNP/CGH microarray and the associated hapmap facilitated the phasing of alleles in lab strains and revealed detrimental genome changes that arose frequently during molecular manipulations of laboratory strains. Furthermore, it provided a useful tool for rapid, high-resolution, and cost-effective characterization of changes in allele diversity as well as changes in chromosome copy number in new C. albicans isolates.Genome changes, such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or copy number variations (CNV), result in rapid and dramatic large-effect changes in phenotypic diversity. To understand relationships between genotype and phenotype, one must determine the types of changes that arose within clonal subpopulations. This includes measuring gene copy number by array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) (Hughes et al. 2000) and determining allele frequencies by using single nucleotide polymorphism\xe2\x80\x93restriction fragment length polymorphism (SNP-RFLP) analysis (Forche et al. 2009b) or using hybridization to microarrays that can distinguish SNP alleles by their differential hybridization properties (Forche et al. 2005; Gresham et al. 2010). We use the heterozygous diploid yeast, C. albicans, as a model system to study genome dynamics. C. albicans is a harmless commensal of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary tract and skin; in hosts with immune deficiencies, it can become a mucosal and/or systemic pathogen. Resistance to fluconazole, the most commonly used antifungal drug, can appear rapidly (Marr et al. 1998; Marr et al. 1997) and poses a serious challenge to the successful treatment of candidal infections (Arendrup et al. 2008; Brion et al. 2007; Ruping et al. 2008; Sun and Singh 2010). Point mutations, homozygosis of specific resistant alleles, and aneuploidies can give rise to fluconazole resistance [reviewed in Niimi et al. (2010)]. Homozygosis of alleles through LOH occurs much more frequently (\xe2\x88\xbc10\xe2\x88\x926 generations) than point mutations (\xe2\x88\xbc10\xe2\x88\x929 generations) (Lang and Murray 2008). LOH events arise through recombination, repair, and/or chromosome segregation mechanisms (Andersen et al. 2008). In C. albicans, rates of LOH increase when cells are exposed to the stress of growth in the host (Forche et al. 2009a) or to physiologically relevant stresses in vitro (Forche et al. 2011). Despite the fact that LOH causes a decrease in allelic diversity at the individual cell level, it facilitates adaptation by revealing recessive alleles that might provide a selective advantage under stress conditions. For example, homozygosis of hyperactive alleles of several genes (e.g. ERG11, TAC1, and MRR1) significantly enhances the ability of C. albicans to grow in the presence of fluconazole (Coste et al. 2007; Morschhauser et al. 2007; White et al. 2002). Notably, adaptive gene combinations are predicted to form more frequently when recombination (and thus LOH) rates are higher under stress and lower in the absence of stress (Hadany and Beker 2003). C. albicans laboratory strains are primarily derived from clinical isolate SC5314 (Gillum et al. 1984). As the first C. albicans isolate with a complete genome sequence (Jones et al. 2004), it is the reference strain used to assemble genome sequences of other isolates (Butler et al. 2009). It includes, on average, one SNP every 270 bp distributed through \xe2\x88\xbc81% of the genome. Approximately 19% of the genome, primarily long telomere-proximal domains, is composed of long tracts of homozygosity (Butler et al. 2009; Jones et al. 2004). Strain construction in C. albicans often incurs unintended alterations in chromosome copy number. A major breakthrough in C. albicans genetics was the construction of strain CAI-4, which lacks both copies of the counter-selectable marker URA3. However, most CAI-4 isolates carry at least one aneuploid chromosome (Chr1 and/or Chr2 trisomy) (Chen et al. 2004; Selmecki et al. 2005). The RM series of strains (Alonso-Monge et al. 2003), in which both alleles of HIS1 were sequentially deleted, underwent a deletion of the terminal \xe2\x88\xbc40 kb of Chr5R distal to the HIS1 locus (Selmecki et al. 2005). Strains that no longer carry these aneuploidies were derived from RM1000 #2, a euploid strain that is homozygous for the distal \xe2\x88\xbc40 kb of Chr5R (Selmecki et al. 2005). Molecular genetics manipulations, including transformation with DNA and strong counterselection for the excision of markers (e.g. URA3), changes levels of aneuploidy in laboratory strains (Bouchonville et al. 2009). Furthermore, in C. albicans, aneuploidy is found in clinical strains: 50% of fluconazole-resistant strains carry at least one aneuploid chromosome. Furthermore, aneuploidy can provide a strong selective advantage with clinical consequences: isochromosome (5L) arose in several different clinical and in vitro evolution isolates and confers drug resistance through increased numbers of two genes on Chr5L (Selmecki et al. 2006, 2008, 2009). Thus, aneuploidy appears to be a rapid and efficient mechanism used by C. albicans to generate a specific selective advantage in the face of strong selective pressure. To follow large-effect genome changes such as LOH and aneuploidy, it is critically important to efficiently detect genomic changes at high resolution. SNP-RFLP and PCR-based methods follow LOH using a small number of SNP markers on each chromosome arm (Arbour et al. 2009; Forche et al. 2011, 2009b). In previous work, we established a hapmap with 150-170 markers linked specific alleles to chromosomal homologs and identified some LOH events in strains that underwent the parasexual cycle or that were passaged through a mammalian host (Forche et al. 2008, 2009a). Here, we constructed a microarray that combines \xe2\x88\xbc39,000 SNP alleles (2 SNP alleles/locus) plus \xe2\x88\xbc20,000 CGH (non-SNP) loci to simultaneously assess LOH and CNV events in C. albicans using commercially available microarrays. Use of this SNP/CGH array, together with strains carrying homozygous or trisomic heterozygous chromosomes, allowed us to assemble a hapmap that distinguishes alleles on each homolog of all eight C. albicans chromosomes. Using the SNP/CGH array, we first determined copy number as a function of chromosome position and then used that information to analyze allele ratios across the genome in commonly used C. albicans laboratory strains. Importantly, we identified LOH events that accumulated sequentially within this series of strains. It appears that, like aneuploidy, increasing degrees of homozygosity incur small, but detectable, fitness costs.'","b'Phenotypic diversity can arise rapidly through loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or by the acquisition of copy number variations (CNV) spanning whole chromosomes or shorter contiguous chromosome segments.

It appears that, like aneuploidy, increasing degrees of homozygosity incur small, but detectable, fitness costs. C. albicans strains used in this study are listed in supporting information, Table S1. We used strains previously shown to be homozygous for one or more chromosomes and/or carrying trisomies (Forche et al. 2008; Legrand et al. 2008) (Figure 1 and Figure S1, A\xe2\x80\x93H). All strains were grown in rich medium (YPAD) (Guthrie and Fink 1991) at 30\xc2\xb0 with shaking. Homolog genotypes of strains used for hapmap construction. Strains derived from a parasexual cross (Forche et al. 2008) contained homozygous (\xe2\x80\x9caa\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbb\xe2\x80\x9d) homologs for most or all of ChrR and Chr2\xe2\x80\x93Chr7 and heterozygous trisomies (\xe2\x80\x9caab\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cabb\xe2\x80\x9d) as indicated. Chromosomes indicated with \xe2\x80\x9caab\xe2\x80\x9c or \xe2\x80\x9cabb\xe2\x80\x9c were trisomic; chromosomes designated \xe2\x80\x9cab\xe2\x80\x9d were heterozygous along the entire length of the chromosome. Chromosomes indicated in color were informative for hapmap construction. Chr2 in strain P1 (**) was homozygous for each homolog along different sections of the chromosome. Color schemes for allelic fractions are consistent in Figures 1\xe2\x80\x934. All probes were designed to be 19 to 33 nt long with melting points (Tm) near 55\xc2\xb0 (Gresham et al. 2010). Initially, probes were designed for 43,658 SNP loci and 28,563 non-SNP loci (including regions that do not have high frequencies of SNPs). SC5314 is homozygous for much of ChrRR, Chr3R, and Chr7L as well as for distal portions of Chr1R, Chr2R, Chr3L, Chr5L, and Chr7R (Butler et al. 2009; Jones et al. 2004); thus we did not include SNP probes from these segments. Probes were eliminated if they had more than one significant alignment (e-value < 0.001) with the reference genome using BLAST analysis (Altschul et al. 1997). The acceptable Tm range was reduced to optimize the number of probes to the Agilent 8\xc3\x9760K microarray format (41,616 SNP allele probes (2 probes per SNP locus, representing the 2 SNP alleles) plus 20,363 non-SNP (CGH) probes (1 per locus)). Quality control of the final array design resulted in a usable SNP allele probe count of 39,222. A total of 19,016 SNP loci (97% of usable SNP loci, Table S2) were informative and were mapped to one of the two homologs. A total of 595 SNP loci (3% of the usable SNP loci, Table S3) were not informative and remained unresolved upon analysis of 24 additional strains (data not shown). These loci likely represent sequences found more than once in the genome or short regions of sequence that differed from the published genome sequence. Analysis of the final microarray data was performed for the two types of probes separately. First, the CGH probe ratios (experimental relative to diploid reference SC5314) were mapped across the genome (Figure 3), providing copy number data. Segmentation of CGH data into regions with a common copy number was done manually or using ChARM (Myers et al. 2004). Distribution of ratio data within each region approximated a normal curve, with the position of the peak indicating copy number. Ratios of \xe2\x88\xbc1.5 (3:2) or \xe2\x88\xbc0.5 (1:2) were considered trisomic (Figure 3, Chr5 and Chr6) or monosomic, respectively. Second, SNP allele data for experimental strains were normalized to data for the heterozygous diploid reference strain SC5314. Comparison of the hybridization of SNP alleles was used to determine the allelic fractions for each SNP locus. For a disomic heterozygous locus, the theoretical allelic fraction is 0.5 (1:1 ratio), and for a homozygous locus, the theoretical allelic fraction is zero or 1 (0:2 or 2:0 ratio, respectively) (Forche et al. 2005). In practice, the disomic homozygous SNP ratios diverged from theoretical values by a small degree (Figure 2B). Allelic fractions were called heterozygous (\xe2\x80\x9cab\xe2\x80\x9d) or homozygous (\xe2\x80\x9caa\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbb\xe2\x80\x9d) if they were within one standard deviation of the relevant peak (Figure 2, A vs. B). These calls were then mapped as a function of genome position and used to determine the fill color behind the CGH figures. Homozygous regions were displayed as magenta (\xe2\x80\x9caa\xe2\x80\x9d) or cyan (\xe2\x80\x9cbb\xe2\x80\x9d) (Figure 3, Chr2, Chr3, Chr4, and Chr7). Disomic heterozygous regions were displayed as gray (\xe2\x80\x9cab\xe2\x80\x9d). For heterozygous chromosomes that were determined to be trisomic by CGH analysis, the theoretical allelic fractions are 0.33 or 0.67 (1:2 or 2:1 ratios, respectively). In practice, the allelic fractions diverged from theoretical values by a small degree (Figure 2C) but were found at the expected 0.33 and 0.67 between the homozygous SNP ratios. Allelic fractions were called as heterozygous (\xe2\x80\x9caab\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cabb\xe2\x80\x9d) if they were within one standard deviation of the relevant peak (Figure 2C). These calls were then mapped as a function of genome position and used to determine the fill color behind the CGH figures (Figure 3, Chr5 and Chr6). Trisomic heterozygous regions were displayed as purple (\xe2\x80\x9caab\xe2\x80\x9d) or blue (\xe2\x80\x9cabb\xe2\x80\x9d). Chromosome segments with no known SNPs and/or no SNP probe data remain uncolored. Assignment of SNPs from allele hybridization ratios. Allelic fractions were calculated from SNP array hybridization data for each chromosome in each strain used to construct the hapmap. In each case, unassigned alleles (left panels with only gray data) were plotted with the X-axis as the allelic fraction [b/(a+b)] and the Y-axis as the number of SNP probes, scaled to maximum height of the peaks. (A) For unassigned alleles on heterozygous chromosomes, a = b and b/(a+b) = 0.5 (dark black vertical line); probes that fall between the boundaries (right panel, green lines, values determined as described in Material and Methods) are considered heterozygous (gray); probes outside these loci are considered homozygous. (B) For unassigned alleles on homozygous chromosomes, the allelic fractions were close to either 0 or 1 (left panel). For alleles on chromosomes previously designated \xe2\x80\x9caa,\xe2\x80\x9d SNP pairs with fractions that fell in the \xe2\x80\x9cbb\xe2\x80\x9d peak were reassigned to \xe2\x80\x9caa\xe2\x80\x9d (magenta, middle panel), and vice versa for \xe2\x80\x9cbb\xe2\x80\x9d alleles (cyan, right panel) using boundaries that were 50% of the distance between the two peaks in the unassigned data and the heterozygous peak location (green lines). (C) For unassigned alleles on trisomic heterozygous chromosomes, the allelic fractions were close to \xe2\x88\xbc0.33 or \xe2\x88\xbc0.67 (\xe2\x80\x9caab\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cabb,\xe2\x80\x9d respectively, left panel). SNP pairs with fractions that fell in the \xe2\x80\x9cabb\xe2\x80\x9d peak were reassigned to \xe2\x80\x9caab\xe2\x80\x9d (purple, middle panel), and vice-versa for \xe2\x80\x9caab\xe2\x80\x9d alleles (blue, right panel). The boundary between the two regions was set at 50% of the distance between the two peaks (red lines). SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism. Visualization of SNP/CGH array data. Data for each strain analyzed by SNP/CGH array was visualized as illustrated for strain Ps8 (and in Figure S1 and Figure S2 for all other strains). Each chromosome is illustrated to scale, with its centromere position indicated by an indentation and major repeat sequence (MRS) positions indicted by a black square below the chromosome. CGH data were calculated as ratios, converted to chromosome copy numbers, displayed as black histograms along the length of the chromosome, and summarized with a large numeral to the right of the chromosome. For SNP alleles, allelic fractions for each chromosome are plotted in the left panels. SNP data were calculated and colored as described in Figure 2. Regions that were homozygous in the reference strain or were not informative were not colored. CGH, comparative genome hybridization; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism. Genomic DNA was prepared from overnight cultures and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 thymidine, using Klenow polymerase described in (Selmecki et al. 2005). Labeled DNA concentrate was diluted to 16 \xc2\xb5l with deionized water. An amount of 4.5 \xc2\xb5l of Agilent 10\xc3\x97 blocking agent and 22.5 \xc2\xb5l of Agilent 2\xc3\x97 hybridization buffer were added. Each mixture of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled DNA was treated according to Agilent standard protocols with incubation for 24 hr at 65\xc2\xb0. After incubation, arrays were washed using wash buffers and acetonitrile solutions per Agilent standard protocols. Microarrays were scanned as 16-bit TIFF images and analyzed using \xe2\x80\x9cBlueFuse for Microarrays\xe2\x80\x9d (BlueGnome, Cambridge). Data were normalized using Block Lowess method and then analyzed at two levels of stringency (one with no data excluded; the second, data excluded when \xe2\x80\x9cQuality less than 1; Confidence less than 0.4; PON Ch1 or Ch2 less than 0.6\xe2\x80\x9d). In-house scripts, organized into a data analysis pipeline, were used to load, process, and display the data and are available upon request. Cells were grown at 30\xc2\xb0 to saturation in liquid YPAD media, diluted 1:1000 in fresh YPAD media and grown for 18 hr at 30\xc2\xb0 in a microplate reader (Sunrise model, Tecan). OD600 was measured every 15 min and used for doubling time calculations. Each experiment included a minimum of six biological replicates for each strain, and each experiment was repeated independently at least twice. Error bars reflect the standard deviation from the mean and P values were determined by Student t-test (Figure 5). Detection of LOH is facilitated by accurate genotyping of SNP alleles. Recently, isothermal melting temperature probes were shown to maximize discrimination of SNP alleles (Gresham et al. 2010), making them ideal for high-resolution analysis of LOH events. To quickly, efficiently, and simultaneously detect large numbers of LOH and CNV events in C. albicans, we designed and constructed a custom microarray including \xe2\x88\xbc39,000 SNP alleles (2 SNP alleles/locus) plus \xe2\x88\xbc20,000 CGH (non-SNP) loci (see Materials and Methods for details) using the Agilent custom array format, which enables simultaneous analysis of eight sets of 60,000 probes. In initial calibration experiments, we found that the non-SNP oligonucleotides accurately reported chromosome copy number and that the SNP allele probes accurately distinguished chromosomes that were known to be heterozygous (Figure 2A) from those known to be homozygous (Figure 2B) (Forche et al. 2008). To assign all SNP alleles on each chromosome to a specific homolog (\xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cb\xe2\x80\x9d), we used lab strains that are homozygous (\xe2\x80\x9caa\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbb\xe2\x80\x9d) or trisomic heterozygous (\xe2\x80\x9caab\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cabb\xe2\x80\x9d) for specific chromosomes (Figure 1) (Forche et al. 2008; Legrand et al. 2008). A total of 97% (38,032) of the SNP alleles were assigned to a specific homolog. The remaining 3% (1190) remained unmapped, either because the SNP was not present in the strains analyzed or because the strains carried multiple SNPs within the locus. First, we analyzed the CGH loci to determine copy number of whole chromosomes. Disomic (\xe2\x88\xbc1:1 ratio) and trisomic (\xe2\x88\xbc2:1 ratio) chromosomes were readily distinguishable. We then assigned the SNP alleles to a given homolog. SNP allele identity (initially arbitrary) was reassigned to the appropriate homolog using data from disomic homozygous (\xe2\x80\x9caa\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbb\xe2\x80\x9d) and/or trisomic (\xe2\x80\x9caab\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabb\xe2\x80\x9d) chromosomes. For disomic homozygous chromosomes, allelic fractions close to 0 or 1 were generally observed, although there was slight variation with each array experiment (Figure 2B). The threshold was set at 50% of the distance between the homozygous and heterozygous values (Figure 2, A and B, green lines). For chromosomes previously identified as homozygous \xe2\x80\x9cbb,\xe2\x80\x9d the SNP alleles were reassigned to \xe2\x80\x9cbb\xe2\x80\x9d if their ratio fell in the \xe2\x80\x9caa\xe2\x80\x9d region, and vice versa. For Chr1, no disomic homozygous strain was available. Thus, a strain trisomic and heterozygous for Chr1 (Ss2-l, Figure 1) was analyzed with the allelic fractions shifted (0.33 or 0.67) (Figure 2C), and the threshold was set at 50% of the distance between the two peaks (Figure 2C, red lines). SNP alleles were assigned to a homolog using similar logic to that described above. SNP/CGH array data collected from eight parasexual progeny isolates (Figure 1) were used to assign SNP alleles (Figure 2). For each strain, data were plotted as a function of chromosome position, and regions of the chromosomes that were informative were shaded to indicate their allelic content (Figure 3 and Figure S1; see Materials and Methods). Hapmaps are primarily useful for the study of strains that are closely related to one another. The degree to which C. albicans lab strains undergo recombination during transformation and subsequent selection steps has not been determined. Thus, we analyzed the multiply marked strains BWP17 (Wilson et al. 1999) and SN76 (Noble and Johnson 2005), as well as several intermediate strains used in their construction from reference strain SC5314. All strains ultimately were constructed from CAI-4 (Figure 4), which lacks both copies of the counterselectable marker URA3. CAF2 (Fonzi and Irwin 1993), an intermediate in the construction of CAI-4, is a ura3\xe2\x88\x86/URA3 strain derived from SC5314 by transformation (Fonzi and Irwin 1993). Genome changes acquired during laboratory strain construction. Summary of SNP/CGH analyses of laboratory strains derived from SC5314 with chromosome copy number illustrated as black histograms and homolog identity colored as in Figure 3. Each strain is illustrated horizontally. Strain construction steps proceed from top to bottom. RM100#13 (bottom of A) was the parent for strain lineages in B and C. Genome changes with successive transformation and counterselection steps are enlarged and/or highlighted: new aneuploidies are highlighted with green borders; new LOH events are highlighted with yellow borders. Genome changes that were maintained in subsequent strains are highlighted with black borders. Subfigures for strains with italicized names were simulated from available data and SNP/CGH analysis of additional CAI-4-derived strains. CGH, comparative genome hybridization; LOH, loss of heterozygosity; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism. Our analysis of LOH and CNVs in related strains revealed the history of changes that arose during strain construction. In brief, approximately 20% of the SC5314 genome is homozygous (Figure 4A) (Butler et al. 2009; Jones et al. 2004). In CAF2, SNP/CGH analysis detected an additional 50 kb LOH on Chr7L, which extended the preexisting region of homozygosity (Figure 4A). In CAI-4, an additional region of Chr3R (64 kb) was homozygosed (Figure 4A). In both CAF2 and CAI-4, the LOH event occurred within 12\xe2\x80\x9325 kb of the centromere. Both of these LOH events are found in all derivatives of CAI-4. Furthermore, as noted previously (Selmecki et al. 2005), some CAI-4 isolates (e.g. CAI-4 F2, Figure 4A) have one trisomy (Chr2), whereas others (e.g. CAI-4 F3, Figure 4A) have two (Chr1 and Chr2). RM10 (his1\xe2\x88\x86/HIS1, ura3\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86) was derived from a CAI-4 isolate by transformation and subsequent FOA selection; it acquired an LOH event that spans most of the left arm of trisomic Chr2 (Figure 4A, 1330 kb). RM100 #13 (his1\xe2\x88\x86/his1\xe2\x88\x86::URA3, ura3\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86) lost one copy of Chr2, retaining the Chr2R \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cb\xe2\x80\x9d alleles, and it also lost a portion (\xe2\x88\xbc40 kb) of the Chr5R \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d homolog distal to HIS1 (Figure 4A) (Selmecki et al. 2005). These changes were retained in strains RM1000 #6 (Figure 4B, his1\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86, ura3\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86) and BWP17 (Figure 4B, arg4\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86, his1\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86, ura3\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86). The Chr5R distal, hemizygous region became homozygous disomic (\xe2\x80\x9cb\xe2\x80\x9d alleles) in transformant RM1000 #2 (Figure 4C, ura3\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86, his1\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86) (Selmecki et al. 2005), and this was retained in its derivative SN76 (Figure 4C, ura3\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86, his1\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86, arg4\xe2\x88\x86\xe2\x88\x86). Both BWP17 and SN76 underwent two transformations and two counterselections on 5-FOA to delete both copies of ARG4. BWP17 acquired an additional LOH on the terminal 30 kb of Chr4R during one of these stages, whereas the SN76 genotype is indistinguishable from that of RM1000 #2. Taken together, these results indicate that LOH, like aneuploidy, often arises during strain constructions involving DNA transformation. These LOH events generate lab strains that are more homozygous than SC5314. Ultimately, accumulated genomic changes have the potential to affect the cellular fitness of an organism. Fitness in asexual microorganisms such as C. albicans is often determined by population doubling time, although the maximum number of doublings in a population also plays an important role (Addinall et al. 2011). In yeasts, aneuploidy often causes reduced fitness [reviewed in Torres et al. (2008)], although specific aneuploidies can also confer fitness advantages under selective as well as nonselective conditions (Dunham et al. 2002; Gresham et al. 2008; Pavelka et al. 2010; Selmecki et al. 2006). To distinguish between the effects of aneuploidy and LOH on fitness, we measured the doubling times for SC5314 and its derivatives (Figure 5) under standard laboratory conditions. Sets of strains with similar degrees of LOH and different ploidies, as well as sets of strains with similar ploidies and different degrees of LOH, were compared. Overall, doubling-time measurements mirrored fitness measurements that incorporate the maximum number of doublings in a population (Figure S3). In vitro growth of lab strains with different degrees of ploidy or LOH or with different URA3 copy number. (A) Deviations from diploidy correlate with increased doubling times. Doubling times (min) were measured for strains with similar degrees of LOH and different degrees whole-genome ploidy. Blue: CAF2 (2N), CAI-4 F2 [2.16N (2N+Chr2)] and CAI-4 F3 [2.38 (2N + (Chr1 + Chr2))] Green: RM1000 #2 (2N) and RM1000 #6 (1.997N) have identical genome content but are homozygous or hemizygous, respectively, for the terminal \xe2\x88\xbc40 kb of Chr5R. Red: SN76 (2N) and BWP17 (1.997N), like the RM1000 strains, are homozygous and hemizygous for the tip of Chr5R; in addition, BWP17 acquired a small (30 kb) LOH on Chr4R. *Within each group, all strains are significantly different from each other (P < 0.05, Student t-test). (B) Increases in percentage of the genome that is homozygous (as indicated on X-axis) correlate with increased doubling times. SC5314 and CAF2 are not different from each other (+) but are significantly different from RM100 #13 and SN76 (*P < 0.05, Student t-test). (C) URA3 status does not affect in vitro doubling times in medium containing uridine. Pairs of strains (teal and purple) with similar ploidies and similar degrees of LOH that differ by one copy of URA3: SC5314 (URA3/URA3) vs. CAF2 (URA3/ura3\xe2\x88\x86), or SN76 (ura3\xe2\x88\x86/ura3\xe2\x88\x86) vs. SN95 (URA3/ura3)) were not significant different in doubling time relative to one another (+). LOH, loss ofheterozygosity. Strains harboring extra copies of large chromosomes had significantly increased doubling times compared with a euploid strain with a similar degree of LOH (Figure 5A, blue). Even very small changes in ploidy (e.g. truncation of 40 kb from Chr5R) resulted in longer doubling times (Figure 5A, green). Importantly, these strains have essentially identical genome content: RM1000 #6 is hemizygous and RM1000 #2 is homozygous for the terminal portion of Chr5R. A similar difference in Chr5R and a similar decrease in fitness distinguished BWP17 from SN76 (Figure 5A, red), although we cannot rule out contributions from the small Chr4R LOH present in BWP17 but not in SN76. The effects of LOH on fitness are not as well documented, because high-resolution methods to measure LOH have not been widely available. Here, we compared the fitness of strains with similar ploidies and different degrees of LOH [SC5314 and CAF2 (Chr7L); RM100 #13 and SN76 (Chr2L, Chr3R, Chr5R, and Chr7L)] under replete growth conditions that should neutralize the contributions of any auxotrophic markers. Interestingly, larger tracts of homozygosity correlated with increased doubling time (Figure 5B), but small increases in homozygosity did not. It is very likely that this is due to the specific alleles involved in the LOH tracts rather than the size of the LOH tract per se. In C. albicans, ura3\xe2\x88\x86/ura3\xe2\x88\x86 strains exhibit altered morphogenesis and reduced virulence (Bain et al. 2001; Chen et al. 2003; Noble and Johnson 2005). Yet in vitro fitness costs have not been determined for ura3\xe2\x88\x86/ura3\xe2\x88\x86 isolates. Comparison of in vitro growth of two sets of strains that differ in URA3 status, yet have similar ploidy (SC5314 and CAF2; SN76 and SN95), revealed no significant change in doubling time (Figure 5C). Thus, under standard lab conditions, using YPAD medium supplemented with uridine, the URA3 genotype has no significant effect on fitness. In general, aneuploidy and LOH both reduce fitness in vitro. Importantly, this is likely due to multiple allele-specific effects in both cases. Furthermore, the degree to which they affect fitness likely differs under different growth conditions. Long-range chromosomal changes such as LOH and CNVs confer large-effect phenotypic variation. Here we describe microarrays that perform both high-resolution SNP and CGH analysis simultaneously. When used together with strains that are homozygous or trisomic, this technology reveals a high-resolution hapmap that allows homolog phasing of the largely heterozygous C. albicans genome. In addition, analysis of lab strain construction history revealed increasing levels of LOH with increasing strain manipulation. We assume that stresses involved in transformation, as well as the stress of growing on counterselection medium, increases the frequencies of LOH as it increases aneuploidy (Bouchonville et al. 2009). Aneuploidy is dynamic and reversible. For example, trisomies can be lost via nondisjunction, restoring the original genotype or resulting in whole-chromosome homozygosis. Recombination between trisomic chromosomes and subsequent chromosome loss can result in large segmental LOH tracts (e.g. Chr2 in RM10 and its derivatives, Figure 4). Shorter segmental monosomies (e.g. Chr5R terminus in RM100) can be restored to disomy, but the alleles remain homozygous. Thus, while aneuploidies can appear and disappear relatively quickly, they can affect the degree of homozygosity. Thus, aneuploidies can cause transient or permanent genome changes. If LOH events occur in aneuploid or euploid strains, the loss of allelic diversity cannot be reversed without events involving mating or mutagenesis. Accordingly, lab strains that underwent more manipulations generally have accumulated more LOH events. These LOH events and aneuploidies do not confer a selective advantage under standard laboratory conditions. In contrast, aneuploidies and LOH events found in azole-resistant clinical isolates can provide a clear selective advantage in the presence of the drug due to specific gene contributions (Coste et al. 2007; Selmecki et al. 2008). This is reminiscent of the situation in S. cerevisiae, where aneuploidies are usually detrimental to growth in standard conditions (Pavelka et al. 2010; Torres et al. 2007) but can provide a selective advantage under some stress conditions (Pavelka et al. 2010; Rancati et al. 2008) and in some genetic backgrounds (Hughes et al. 2000). Paradoxically, despite the stable accumulation of LOH tracts with sequential exposure to stress, most clinical isolates are largely heterozygous. This implies that parasexual mating between nonsisters must occur at a high enough frequency to restore the observed heterozygosity. Alternatively, selection forces in vivo strongly favor the survival of strains with more heterozygosity. Heat shock, which is used to isolate transformants, clearly promotes aneuploidy (Bouchonville et al. 2009; Hilton et al. 1985). This may be due to depletion of HSP90 and its cofactor Sgt1, which in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for assembly and stability of centromere/kinetochore and centrosome complexes (Bansal et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2008) and may influence the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

incidence of aneuploidy in that organism. Elevated temperature, such as that in febrile patients (e.g. 39\xc2\xb0), also results in increased frequencies of LOH (Forche et al. 2011), and thus, the heat shock step in DNA transformations may promote recombination that leads to LOH as well. However, it should be noted that transformation by electroporation also results in increased aneuploidy (Bouchonville et al. 2009). Strong selection pressure applied to identify rare transformants also promotes the appearance of aneuploidy [e.g. on 5-FOA, (Wellington and Rustchenko 2005)]. LOH rates also increase under the stress of growth in vivo (Forche et al. 2009a) and in response to fluconazole or oxidative stress applied in vitro (Forche et al. 2011). The effects of large aneuploidies, especially extra copies of Chr1 and Chr2, which increase ploidy by \xe2\x88\xbc20%, had a more dramatic effect on doubling time and fitness than the most extensive cumulative LOH (Figure 5, BWP17 and SN76, homozygous for almost \xe2\x88\xbc35% of the genome). However, because SC5314 is already homozygous for \xe2\x88\xbc20% of the genome, there may be less dynamic range available to detect effects of LOH on fitness. Importantly, the effect of LOH and aneuploidy on fitness is likely to vary, depending upon the specific genes and alleles involved, as well as on the growth conditions being used to measure fitness. In summary, we designed and demonstrated the utility of a combined SNP/CGH array for high-resolution, rapid, and accurate detection of large-effect genome changes, including both LOH and CNV events. This array, together with its analysis pipeline, is a useful and cost-effective tool for characterizing laboratory as well as clinical strains. Furthermore, this study highlights that whole-genome analysis of engineered mutants should be performed prior to using such mutants in critical experiments. This will facilitate the identification of strains with the desired levels of ploidy and heterozygosity. In addition, the hapmap alleles provided here will greatly facilitate the phasing of SNPs in commonly used laboratory strains. This is essential for optimal appreciation of allele specificity found within next-generation sequencing data. Clearly, once high-throughput sequencing and data analysis becomes affordable and accessible to all researchers, it will obviate the need for array analysis. However, until that time, this technology and the data pipelines for its analysis are important and useful tools for the Candida albicans research community.

N. furzeri comprises several wild-derived strains with striking differences in longevity ranging from 3 to 9 months, which makes it a powerful vertebrate model for aging research. The short life cycle of N. furzeri should also facilitate studies on adult traits that are specific to vertebrates. Although progress has been made to generate a genetic linkage map and to start sequencing the genome of N. furzeri, tools to genetically manipulate this species of fish have not yet been developed. Here, we report the first establishment of transgenesis in N. furzeri. We use the Tol2 transposase system to generate transgenic N. furzeri that express green fluorescent protein driven by the Xenopus cytoskeletal actin promoter or the zebrafish heat-shock protein 70 promoter. We successfully generate stable transgenic lines of N. furzeri with germline transmission of integrated transgene. The development of transgenesis in N. furzeri provides a powerful tool to investigate the mechanisms underlying aging and longevity in a short-lived vertebrate model. Transgenesis in this fish will also facilitate the study of other phenotypes, including adult tissue regeneration and cognitive behavior.The African killifish Nothobranchius furzeri (N. furzeri) has an exceptionally short lifespan (3\xe2\x80\x939 months, depending on the strain), and it is a uniquely promising model system for genetic studies of aging and age-dependent diseases in vertebrates (Di Cicco et al. 2010; Genade et al. 2005; Hartmann et al. 2009). These fish normally live in ephemeral water pools in southeastern Africa, where water is present only during the brief rainy season (Genade et al. 2005). In the laboratory, the lifespan of N. furzeri is 5 to 10 times shorter than the lifespan of mice and zebrafish, respectively. Interestingly, there are several wild-derived N. furzeri strains that differ strikingly in their captive lifespan by 2- to 3-fold (Terzibasi et al. 2008), potentially allowing the identification of novel genes regulating lifespan in vertebrates by linkage mapping and comparative genomics. N. furzeri is also responsive to environmental stimuli that affect aging in other species, including dietary restriction (Terzibasi et al. 2009), a resveratrol-rich diet (Valenzano et al. 2006b), and temperature (Valenzano et al. 2006a). These characteristics make N. furzeri an ideal model for research on vertebrate aging and longevity. Additional features of N. furzeri make it an attractive model, even outside the aging field. N. furzeri can achieve sexual maturation in 25\xe2\x80\x9330 days, providing a unique system to study the developmental processes involved in maturation to adulthood. Under controlled laboratory conditions, N. furzeri has the shortest life cycle among vertebrate species that can be bred in captivity (about 40 days), which should facilitate the study of adult traits, including tissue regeneration, cognitive behavior, and susceptibility to disease. Finally, like other species of the genus Nothobranchius, N. furzeri undergoes embryonic diapause, with embryos that can survive in dry mud for up to a year (Levels et al. 1986; Markofsky and Matias 1977; Matias 1984), providing a potential model for developmental diapause in vertebrates. Several genetic and genomic tools have already been developed in N. furzeri. The first genetic linkage map based on microsatellites was recently generated in this species of fish (Valenzano et al. 2009). Furthermore, N. furzeri\xe2\x80\x99s genome has been partially sequenced by shotgun Sanger sequencing (Reichwald et al. 2009). Next-generation sequencing of the genome of short-lived and long-lived strains of N. furzeri is underway. However, no method of transgene expression has been developed to date in this species. Transgenesis in a vertebrate model with a short lifespan and life cycle would be a powerful tool to screen for genes that govern adult phenotypes. Transgenesis in fish has greatly benefited from transposase systems, such as Tol1, Tol2, and Sleeping Beauty, which were all successfully used in zebrafish transgenesis (Davidson et al. 2003; Grabher and Wittbrodt 2007; Kawakami et al. 2000, 2004; Koga et al. 2008). The Tol2 transposon was also developed as a system to efficiently generate transgenic animals in other model systems, including stickleback, the frog Xenopus tropicalis, and chicken (Chan et al. 2010; Hamlet et al. 2006; Kawakami 2007). Tol2 is an active DNA transposable element capable of catalyzing transposition upon recognition of a target sequence. The Tol2 transposition system used for transgenesis consists of two elements: an RNA encoding the Tol2 transposase and a plasmid containing a nonautonomous Tol2 transposon (i.e. not encoding the transposase) surrounding the gene of interest (Kawakami 2004, 2007; Kawakami et al. 2000). The transposase recognizes the target Tol2 sequence in the plasmid, excises the gene of interest, and integrates it into the host\xe2\x80\x99s genome (Kawakami et al. 2000; Ni et al. 2008), thus allowing efficient and stable transgenesis. Here, we generate transgenic N. furzeri fish expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the ubiquitous Xenopus cytoskeletal actin promoter or the zebrafish heat-shock protein 70 promoter using the Tol2 transposase system. We also show that the transgene is stably integrated into the genome and can be transmitted through the germline to the F1 and F2 generations. The development of transgenesis in N. furzeri will be crucial for testing the role of specific genes in the shortest-lived available vertebrate model system.'","b'The African killifish Nothobranchius furzeri is the shortest-lived vertebrate that can be bred in captivity. N. furzeri comprises several wild-derived strains with striking differences in longevity ranging from 3 to 9 months, which makes it a powerful vertebrate model for aging research. The short life cycle of N. furzeri should also facilitate studies on adult traits that are specific to vertebrates. Although progress has been made to generate a genetic linkage map and to start sequencing the genome of N. furzeri, tools to genetically manipulate this species of fish have not yet been developed. Here, we report the first establishment of transgenesis in N. furzeri. We use the Tol2 transposase system to generate transgenic N. furzeri that express green fluorescent protein driven by the Xenopus cytoskeletal actin promoter or the zebrafish heat-shock protein 70 promoter. We successfully generate stable transgenic lines of N. furzeri with germline transmission of integrated transgene. The development of transgenesis in N. furzeri provides a powerful tool to investigate the mechanisms underlying aging and longevity in a short-lived vertebrate model. Transgenesis in this fish will also facilitate the study of other phenotypes, including adult tissue regeneration and cognitive behavior. The African killifish Nothobranchius furzeri (N. furzeri) has an exceptionally short lifespan (3\xe2\x80\x939 months, depending on the strain), and it is a uniquely promising model system for genetic studies of aging and age-dependent diseases in vertebrates (Di Cicco et al. 2010; Genade et al. 2005; Hartmann et al. 2009). These fish normally live in ephemeral water pools in southeastern Africa, where water is present only during the brief rainy season (Genade et al. 2005). In the laboratory, the lifespan of N. furzeri is 5 to 10 times shorter than the lifespan of mice and zebrafish, respectively. Interestingly, there are several wild-derived N. furzeri strains that differ strikingly in their captive lifespan by 2- to 3-fold (Terzibasi et al. 2008), potentially allowing the identification of novel genes regulating lifespan in vertebrates by linkage mapping and comparative genomics. N. furzeri is also responsive to environmental stimuli that affect aging in other species, including dietary restriction (Terzibasi et al. 2009), a resveratrol-rich diet (Valenzano et al. 2006b), and temperature (Valenzano et al. 2006a). These characteristics make N. furzeri an ideal model for research on vertebrate aging and longevity. Additional features of N. furzeri make it an attractive model, even outside the aging field. N. furzeri can achieve sexual maturation in 25\xe2\x80\x9330 days, providing a unique system to study the developmental processes involved in maturation to adulthood. Under controlled laboratory conditions, N. furzeri has the shortest life cycle among vertebrate species that can be bred in captivity (about 40 days), which should facilitate the study of adult traits, including tissue regeneration, cognitive behavior, and susceptibility to disease. Finally, like other species of the genus Nothobranchius, N. furzeri undergoes embryonic diapause, with embryos that can survive in dry mud for up to a year (Levels et al. 1986; Markofsky and Matias 1977; Matias 1984), providing a potential model for developmental diapause in vertebrates. Several genetic and genomic tools have already been developed in N. furzeri. The first genetic linkage map based on microsatellites was recently generated in this species of fish (Valenzano et al. 2009). Furthermore, N. furzeri\xe2\x80\x99s genome has been partially sequenced by shotgun Sanger sequencing (Reichwald et al. 2009). Next-generation sequencing of the genome of short-lived and long-lived strains of N. furzeri is underway. However, no method of transgene expression has been developed to date in this species. Transgenesis in a vertebrate model with a short lifespan and life cycle would be a powerful tool to screen for genes that govern adult phenotypes. Transgenesis in fish has greatly benefited from transposase systems, such as Tol1, Tol2, and Sleeping Beauty, which were all successfully used in zebrafish transgenesis (Davidson et al. 2003; Grabher and Wittbrodt 2007; Kawakami et al. 2000, 2004; Koga et al. 2008). The Tol2 transposon was also developed as a system to efficiently generate transgenic animals in other model systems, including stickleback, the frog Xenopus tropicalis, and chicken (Chan et al. 2010; Hamlet et al. 2006; Kawakami 2007). Tol2 is an active DNA transposable element capable of catalyzing transposition upon recognition of a target sequence. The Tol2 transposition system used for transgenesis consists of two elements: an RNA encoding the Tol2 transposase and a plasmid containing a nonautonomous Tol2 transposon (i.e. not encoding the transposase) surrounding the gene of interest (Kawakami 2004, 2007; Kawakami et al. 2000). The transposase recognizes the target Tol2 sequence in the plasmid, excises the gene of interest, and integrates it into the host\xe2\x80\x99s genome (Kawakami et al. 2000; Ni et al. 2008), thus allowing efficient and stable transgenesis. Here, we generate transgenic N. furzeri fish expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the ubiquitous Xenopus cytoskeletal actin promoter or the zebrafish heat-shock protein 70 promoter using the Tol2 transposase system. We also show that the transgene is stably integrated into the genome and can be transmitted through the germline to the F1 and F2 generations. The development of transgenesis in N. furzeri will be crucial for testing the role of specific genes in the shortest-lived available vertebrate model system. The pBHR construct expressing GFP under the control of the zebrafish heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) promoter was obtained from David Kingsley (Chan et al. 2010) and was renamed pHsp70-gfp Tol2 in the remainder of the study. The pCska-gfp Tol2 construct was generated by subcloning the Xenopus borealis cytoskeletal actin promoter from the pCska-gfp-SceI construct (Thermes et al. 2002) into the pHsp70-gfp Tol2 (pBHR) construct (Chan et al. 2010) between the ApaI and SalI sites, thereby replacing the Hsp70 promoter cassette (Figure 1). The pHsp70-gfp Tol2 and pCska-gfp Tol2 constructs also contain the mCherry reporter gene driven by the zebrafish cardiac myocyte light chain (Cmlc2) promoter. Transgenic constructs. Transgenic constructs containing two Tol2 recognition elements (1 and 2) flanking a cassette comprising a promoter driving the gfp reporter gene. Two promoters were used in this study: Xenopus borealis cytoskeletal actin (Cska) and zebrafish heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). This cassette also contains the zebrafish cardiac myocyte light chain (Cmlc2) promoter driving the mCherry gene, although we have not analyzed expression of mCherry. The Tol2 transposase recognizes the Tol2 elements, excises the cassette, and integrates it into the host\xe2\x80\x99s genome. The medaka Tol2 transposase mRNA was transcribed from the pCS-TP plasmid (Kawakami et al. 2004) using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), according to the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s protocol. N. furzeri strains [GRZ and MZM-0403 (Terzibasi et al. 2008)] were housed at 25\xc2\xb0 in a central filtration recirculating system with a 12 hr light/dark cycle as previously described (Genade et al. 2005; Valenzano et al. 2009) and fed twice a day with freeze-dried bloodworms (Hikari, Japan). N. furzeri embryos can undergo diapause, a developmental arrested stage that can last up to a year (Inglima et al. 1981; Podrabsky and Hand 1999). Prolonged exposure of the fertilized embryos to low oxygen or to the presence of adult fish induces diapause (Inglima et al. 1981), thereby substantially lengthening the life cycle. To produce one- to two-cell stage embryos for microinjection and to avoid diapause initiation, one 4- to 5-week-old fertile adult male (i.e. one that has already generated fertilized eggs) was placed with three fertile females of the same age in the same 9.5 liter tank. Male and female fish were separated by a plastic mesh for 24 hr. The night prior to injection, the mesh was removed and the fish were allowed to naturally spawn overnight over a fine sand substrate until 2 hr after the light was turned on in the fish room. Eggs were sieved from the sand with a strainer and kept at 4\xc2\xb0 in 1X Yamamoto embryo solution (17 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 0.02 mM NaHCO3, pH 7.3) (Westerfield 2000) with 0.1 \xce\xbcl/ml of Methylene Blue (Kordon, 2.3% stock solution) to limit parasitic infection. Injections occurred within 1 hr of embryo collection. With this protocol, 18% of the embryos are at the one-cell stage, 28% are at the two-cell stage, and 54% have more than two cells (n = 303 embryos). Embryos were injected at the one- or two-cell stage to minimize chimeric integration of the transgene. To hold the embryos for injection, a 1.5% agarose plate was cast with an ad hoc built plastic mold that produced six 1 mm-wide trenches (Figure 2, A and B). One- or two-cell stage embryos were injected using borosilicate microcapillaries (Harvard Apparatus GC100F-10, Holliston, MA). Capillaries were pulled with a micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument P-87, Novato, CA) using the following parameters: pressure = 450, heat = ramp value \xe2\x88\x92 15\xc2\xb0; pull = 50; velocity = 80; time = 200. The needles designed for N. furzeri injection have a shorter and less flexible tip than zebrafish injection needles to allow easier penetration through a thicker chorion (Figure 2C). The capillary was then filled with 1.5 \xce\xbcl of a water solution containing 15 ng/\xce\xbcl of plasmid DNA (purified by Plasmid Maxi kit, Qiagen), 15 ng/\xce\xbcl of Tol2 transposase RNA, and 1% phenol red (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) to track the injected solution. The embryos were injected with 5 pl of this solution, which corresponds to a tenth of the embryo\xe2\x80\x99s volume at the one- or two-cell stage. The solution was pressure-injected at 30 psi with 75 ms pulses. Injections were performed under a Nikon C-PS stereoscope and Zeiss KL 1500 LCD (Stuttgart, Germany) optic fibers. The injection apparatus (Applied Scientific Instrumentation, Eugene, OR) consists of an MHC model magnetic stand, an MMPI model pressure injector, a foot switch to pulse the injected solution into the embryos, an MM3 model micromanipulator, and an M-PIP model micropipette holder (Applied Scientific Instrumentation), assisted by a backpressure unit (Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT) to gauge the pulsed release of pressurized nitrogen. Microinjection plate and needle for transgenesis. (A) Microinjection plate cast using an ad hoc built plastic mold. Embryos selected for injection are aligned along the trenches and pierced with borosilicate needles. Up to 40 embryos could fit each trench. (B) Plastic mold design and measures. (C) Comparison between the microinjection needle for zebrafish (top) and N. furzeri (bottom). N. furzeri needles are sturdier than zebrafish needles, allowing better chorion piercing. Injected and control noninjected embryos were immersed in 1\xc3\x97 Yamamoto embryo solution with 0.1 \xce\xbcl/ml of Methylene Blue and incubated at 26\xc2\xb0 until they developed eyes (6\xe2\x80\x938 days). Upon development of the eyes, embryos were inspected for GFP fluorescence (see below) and transferred to Petri dishes with autoclaved, humidified, nonchemically treated peat moss substrate (Uni-Gro Premium Organic Peat Moss, San Bernardino, CA). Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and incubated at room temperature until completion of fish development (additional 5\xe2\x80\x9310 days). To detect GFP fluorescence in injected fish and their offspring, a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) MZ-16 FA fluorescence stereomicroscope was used. Images were acquired using the following parameters for GFP: 1.1 sec of exposure; 2.1\xc3\x97 of gain; 0.9 of saturation; 0.53 of gamma; and for bright field: 97 ms of exposure; 2.1\xc3\x97 of gain; 0.9 of saturation; 0.53 of gamma. We used 2.1 sec of exposure to detect GFP in pHsp70-gfp Tol2 embryos. Images were acquired with a Leica DFC 500 camera and processed with Leica application Suite V3. Germline transmission of the transgene was tested by PCR on genomic DNA extracted from caudal fin clips following a standard zebrafish genomic DNA extraction protocol (Westerfield 2000). PCR reactions were performed in 25 \xce\xbcl of reaction volume with 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (ABI AmpliTaq, Foster City, CA), 1\xc3\x97 PCR buffer (ABI AmpliTaq), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 5 ng of genomic DNA, 0.8 \xce\xbcM dNTPs (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.4 \xce\xbcM of primers (gfp forward primer, 5\xe2\x80\xb2 CAC ATG AAG CAG CAC GAC TT 3\xe2\x80\xb2; gfp reverse primer, 5\xe2\x80\xb2 TGC TCA GGT AGT GGT TGT CG 3\xe2\x80\xb2; N. furzeri igf1r forward primer, 5\xe2\x80\xb2 CCA TCC TAG CGA CTA TCT TAA TTG T 3\xe2\x80\xb2; N. furzeri igf1r reverse primer, 5\xe2\x80\xb2 TCC TTA ACA ACG CCT TTC G 3\xe2\x80\xb2). The following program was used: 95\xc2\xb0 for 3 min, 5 cycles of 30 sec at 95\xc2\xb0, 30 sec at 57\xc2\xb0, 45 sec at 72\xc2\xb0, 27 cycles of 30 sec at 95\xc2\xb0, 30 sec at 56\xc2\xb0, 45 sec at 72\xc2\xb0, and 4 min at 72\xc2\xb0. PCR products (379 bp for gfp and 550 bp for igf1r) were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel. For Southern blot analysis, 5 \xce\xbcg of caudal fin was digested with BamHI and EcoRI for 16 hr. Digested DNA was resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel, depurinated in 0.2 M HCl, denatured in Denaturing Buffer (0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl), and transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) by capillary transfer in SSC 20\xc3\x97 buffer (Invitrogen). The membrane was hybridized overnight at 66\xc2\xb0 with a 32P-labeled probe in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The membrane was washed twice for 20 min in 2\xc3\x97 SSC buffer, 0.1% SDS, and then twice in 0.2\xc3\x97 SSC buffer, 0.1% SDS before exposure (Amersham Hyperfilm MP, GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The probe was generated by PCR amplification of a 379 bp region within the gfp cDNA from the pCska-gfp Tol2 plasmid (1 ng). The PCR conditions were the same as those described above. The PCR product was resolved on a 1% agarose gel, and the gfp DNA fragment was purified using a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The probe was labeled using the RadPrime DNA Labeling kit (Invitrogen) and 30 \xce\xbcCi of \xce\xb132P dGTP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). The labeled probe was purified on a G50 microspin column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), denatured for 5 min at 95\xc2\xb0, and added to the membrane for hybridization. The African killifish N. furzeri is the shortest-lived, fastest maturing vertebrate that can be reproduced in captivity (Table 1). It is a uniquely promising new vertebrate model system to study aging and age-dependent traits. A critical step in developing N. furzeri as a model system is the ability to generate transgenic fish. N. furzeri embryos are protected by a thick chorion that allows them to survive prolonged drought and develop in the absence of water. To pierce through the thick chorion, we designed specific injection needles that are shorter and less flexible than the standard needles used to inject zebrafish eggs, and we clamped the eggs within agarose trenches (Figure 2). To increase the chance of germline transmission of the transgene, we injected N. furzeri embryos at the one- or two-cell stage. On the basis of successful transgenesis methods developed in zebrafish and stickleback (Chan et al. 2010; Kawakami et al. 2000), we used the Tol2 transposase system. We generated a pCska-gfp Tol2 construct encoding enhanced GFP driven by the Xenopus cytoskeletal actin promoter, a promoter that has been shown to be active in Xenopus and zebrafish and allows ubiquitous expression (Figure 1) (Lakin et al. 1993; Thermes et al. 2002). The pCska-gfp Tol2 construct was injected into one- or two-cell stage embryos of the MZM-0403 strain of N. furzeri in the presence or absence of Tol2 transposase mRNA. The expression of GFP in live embryos was determined by fluorescence stereomicroscopy at 12 days postinjection. The presence of the Tol2 mRNA increases the percentage of GFP-positive fish from 0.8% (1 out of 127) to 25% (15 out of 61). We also injected the pHsp70-gfp Tol2 construct (Chan et al. 2010) to drive GFP expression from the zebrafish Hsp70 promoter (Figure 1). With the pHsp70-gfp Tol2 construct, 36% of the embryos were positive for GFP (33 out of 92) in the presence of Tol2 mRNA. These results indicate that the presence of the Tol2 transposase allows expression of the transgene in about one third of the embryos that survived injection (at this stage, our percentage of survival after injection is 70%). To determine the pattern of GFP expression in fish injected with the pCskA-gfp Tol2 construct and to test how long GFP expression lasted, we monitored GFP expression in live, injected 12-day-old embryos, 5-day-old fry, and 1- to 3-month-old adult fish by fluorescence stereomicroscopy. Embryos and fry that were injected with the pCskA-gfp Tol2 construct showed strong GFP expression (Figure 3). The expression of GFP was patchy in fry, probably due to a certain degree of mosaicism (Figure 3). Adult fish expressed GFP relatively ubiquitously, with high expression in the eyes (Figure 4). These results indicate that expression of the transgene persists through adulthood, suggesting that the transgene has integrated into N. furzeri\xe2\x80\x99s genome. Expression of GFP in pCska-gfp Tol2 transgenic N. furzeri. GFP expression in live noninjected (top row), injected P0 fish (second row), and the F1 (third row), and F2 (bottom row) progeny of GFP-positive N. furzeri. Pictures were taken 12 days postfertilization for embryos, and 5 days posthatching for fry. Bright field and GFP images are shown for embryos. Scale bar: 1 mm. GFP, green fluorescent protein. Expression of GFP in adult N. furzeri injected with pCska-gfp Tol2. GFP expression in noninjected P0 adult fish and in P0, F1, and F2 adult fish injected with the pCska-gfp Tol2 construct. The P0 and F1 fish are 3-month-old adults. The F2 fish is a 1-month-old adult. The GFP images for individual fish were digitally assembled from individual snapshots. Scale bar: 5 mm. GFP, green fluorescent protein. We also monitored GFP expression in fish injected with the pHsp70-gfp Tol2 transgenic construct. Fish injected with this construct expressed GFP in embryo, fry, and adult (Figure 5). GFP expression was detected even in the absence of heat shock, likely due to the basal activity of the hsp70 promoter. Thus, the Tol2 transposase system allowed us to generate P0 N. furzeri fish that express GFP from two different promoters. Expression of GFP in N. furzeri injected with pHsp70-gfp Tol2. GFP expression in 12-day-old embryos, 5-day-old fry, and 3-month-old adult N. furzeri fish injected with the pHsp70-gfp Tol2 construct. GFP expression was observed even without heat-shocking the individuals. Bright field and GPF images are shown for embryos. Scale bar: 1 mm for embryos; 5 mm for fry and adult fish. GFP, green fluorescent protein. One of the most important aspects of transgenesis is the ability to generate lines of transgenic fish by achieving germline transmission of the transgene. To determine whether the parental transgenic fish could transmit the transgene to their progeny, we monitored GFP expression in F1 offspring of five GFP-positive male P0 fish injected with pCska-gfp Tol2 and positive for GFP expression, each crossed with 3 wild-type adult females. Of the 5 tested males, 2 produced transgenic offspring, and 130 out of 452 F1 fish (29%) were GFP-positive by fluorescence stereomicroscopy (Figures 3 and 4). These results indicate that the transgene can be successfully transmitted through the germline. The fact that less than 50% of the F1 offspring of P0 GFP-positive fish are GFP-positive could be due to mosaicism of the integration or to silencing of the transgene. Intercrossing GFP-positive F1 fish resulted in GFP-positive F2 transgenic offspring (Figures 3 and 4). Thus, the Tol2 transposase system allows germline transmission of the transgene. To test whether the transgene is chromosomally transmitted through the germline, we analyzed genomic DNA from GFP-positive P0 fish, GFP-positive F1 and F2 fish, and noninjected fish using PCR with primers specific to gfp. We found that genomic DNA of GFP-positive P0, F1, and F2 fish indeed contained the gfp DNA (Figure 6A). These results suggest that the transgene is integrated into the genome of N. furzeri and chromosomally transmitted through the germline. Integration of the transgene into N. furzeri\xe2\x80\x99s genome (A) PCR amplification of genomic DNA from transgenic fish using primers for gfp (upper panel) and igf1r (lower panel). The arrow indicates the amplified gfp band.

F1 and F2 fish with the same number (1 and 2) belong to the same family and, therefore, share the same band size (indicated by the arrows) for gfp. GFP, green fluorescent protein. To test in an independent manner the integration of the transgene into N. furzeri\xe2\x80\x99s genome, we analyzed the genomic DNA of two F1 and F2 GFP-positive individuals from the same P0 parent by Southern blot with a gfp probe. We found that F1 and F2 fish genomic DNA contains bands that are recognized by the gfp probe (Figure 6B). There were two distinct banding patterns, suggesting at least two integration sites of the transgene (Figure 6B). Analysis of two other F2 fish from the same parent by Southern blot revealed two additional banding patterns (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that the transgene is integrated in the genome of N. furzeri and that it can be chromosomally transmitted through the germline. The presence of several banding patterns in progeny from one P0 parent indicates that Tol2 transgenesis in N. furzeri resulted in several integration sites in the P0 injected fish. The successful development of transgenesis in an exceptionally short-lived vertebrate will be a crucial step in rapidly screening for genes that regulate lifespan and adult traits in vertebrates. In this study, we successfully developed transgenesis in the African short-lived killifish N. furzeri using the Tol2 transposase system. We generated transgenic lines of N. furzeri expressing GFP under the control of a Xenopus ubiquitous cytoskeletal actin promoter, with integration of the transgene into the genome and successful chromosomal transmission of the transgene trough the germline. Along with the I-SceI meganuclease system and the Sleeping Beauty transposase system (Grabher and Wittbrodt 2007), Tol2 is the most effective transgenesis tool used in fish (Kawakami 2007; Ni et al. 2008). The Tol2 transposase system has been widely used in zebrafish to create stable lines of transgenic fish (Kawakami 2004; Suster et al. 2009). This system has also been used with success in stickleback to generate transgenic P0 individuals (Chan et al. 2010). Transgenic lines have only been developed in laboratory fish species, such as zebrafish and medaka (Lu et al. 1992; Stuart et al. 1988), or in commercially relevant species such as salmon, trout, and tilapia (Guyomard et al. 1989; Martinez et al. 1996; Yaskowiak et al. 2006). Our study adds N. furzeri to the fish species that can be used as genetically tractable models to study specific traits. The percentage of injected N. furzeri embryos that are GFP-positive as visualized by fluorescence microscopy is relatively high (one quarter to one third of the injected N. furzeri embryos, depending on the construct injected). The percentage of embryos that have integrated the transgene may even be higher. Construct integration in transcriptionally inactive regions could prevent transgene expression. Active silencing of the transcript or targeted GFP protein degradation could also lower the overall number of transgenic fish that visibly express GFP. Differences in GFP expression rates between the two constructs (pCska-gfp Tol2 and pHsp70-gfp Tol2) may be due to the promoters used, which likely promote different pattern and intensity of expression, thereby affecting the threshold for detecting GFP fluorescence. GFP expression driven by the cytoskeletal actin (Cska) promoter or the heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) promoter is relatively ubiquitous in N. furzeri in the P0 generation. Expression of GFP from the hsp70 promoter was observed even in the absence of heat shock, possibly because this promoter allows basal level of expression. Alternatively, fish may be experiencing some levels of stress that trigger a heat-shock\xe2\x80\x93like response. As both transgenes also contain the mCherry reporter gene under the control of the cardiac myocyte light chain (Cmlc2) promoter, we anticipate that transgenic fish should also express mCherry in their heart, although we have not examined the pattern of expression of mCherry. The pervasive expression of GFP in P0 individuals could be due to the early integration of the transgene during development and/or to multiple integration sites of the transgene in the genome. Embryonic development is slower in N. furzeri than in zebrafish, which may facilitate early integration of the transgene and germline transmission. The slow embryonic development of N. furzeri might increase the chances of early embryo integration and, therefore, robust germline transmission compared with other model systems. Indeed, the frequency of GFP-positive F1 offspring from a cross between GFP-positive P0 parents and wild-type fish is about 30% in N. furzeri. A perfect germline transmission with one site of integration would give rise to 50% GFP-positive F1 fish. Given that there is more than one integration site in P0 parents (Figure 6B), the fact that we obtained 30% GFP-positive F1 fish indicates that there is a certain degree of mosaicism of the germline but that germline transmission is relatively efficient. As a comparison, the frequency of transgenic F1 offspring has been reported to range from 3 to 100% in zebrafish (Kawakami et al. 2004; Urasaki et al. 2006). Thus, N. furzeri germline transmission of the transgene is a relatively frequent event and is well within the range of that of zebrafish, which should highly facilitate the generation of transgenic lines. The development of transgenesis in N. furzeri, together with the recent development of genetic and genomic resources for this species (Reichwald et al. 2009; Valenzano et al. 2009), provides the scientific community with a powerful new model system to study vertebrate aging. For example, transgenesis in N. furzeri will help to rapidly test the effects of candidate genes in modulating vertebrate longevity, and it opens the possibility of genetic screens for genes affecting aging in vertebrates. The use of transgenesis in N. furzeri will also help study several other vertebrate-specific phenotypes. For example, it could facilitate identification of the mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration and adult stem-cell function in relation to age. Moreover, N. furzeri transgenesis will be helpful to analyze the ontogenesis of conspicuous sexual traits, such as fin pigmentation patterns and courtship behaviors in males. Finally, transgenesis will be a key tool in identifying genetic factors regulating developmental diapause, a characteristic phenotype of oviparous fish of the order Cyprinodontiformes, which includes the genus Nothobranchius (Inglima et al. 1981; Levels et al. 1986; Markofsky and Matias 1977; Matias 1984; Podrabsky et al. 2001; Podrabsky and Somero 2007). Transgenesis is a crucial step in the development of N. furzeri as a genetically tractable short-lived vertebrate system.

3,"['Jürgen Wendland', 'Andrea Walther']","December 8, 2011.",Genome Evolution in the Eremothecium Clade of the Saccharomyces Complex Revealed by Comparative Genomics,"b'We used comparative genomics to elucidate the genome evolution within the pre\xe2\x80\x93whole-genome duplication genus Eremothecium. To this end, we sequenced and assembled the complete genome of Eremothecium cymbalariae, a filamentous ascomycete representing the Eremothecium type strain. Genome annotation indicated 4712 gene models and 143 tRNAs. We compared the E. cymbalariae genome with that of its relative, the riboflavin overproducer Ashbya (Eremothecium) gossypii, and the reconstructed yeast ancestor. Decisive changes in the Eremothecium lineage leading to the evolution of the A. gossypii genome include the reduction from eight to seven chromosomes, the downsizing of the genome by removal of 10% or 900 kb of DNA, mostly in intergenic regions, the loss of a TY3-Gypsy\xe2\x80\x93type transposable element, the re-arrangement of mating-type loci, and a massive increase of its GC content. Key species-specific events are the loss of MNN1-family of mannosyltransferases required to add the terminal fourth and fifth \xce\xb1-1,3-linked mannose residue to O-linked glycans and genes of the Ehrlich pathway in E. cymbalariae and the loss of ZMM-family of meiosis-specific proteins and acquisition of riboflavin overproduction in A. gossypii. This reveals that within the Saccharomyces complex genome, evolution is not only based on genome duplication with subsequent gene deletions and chromosomal rearrangements but also on fungi associated with specific environments (e.g. involving fungal-insect interactions as in Eremothecium), which have encountered challenges that may be reflected both in genome streamlining and their biosynthetic potential.Studying yeast genomes provides crucial insight into the evolution of these genomes on the molecular level. One large class known as hemiascomycetes contains the budding yeasts with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which was the first eukaryotic species whose genome was sequenced (Goffeau 1996). This endeavor has been followed by sequencing efforts using next-generation sequencing methodology, which provided a wealth of information, particularly for species in the Saccharomyces complex (Dujon et al., 2004; Cuomo and Birren 2010). Compilation of large amounts of sequence data can be used to generate a compendium of genes shared by a common ancestor prior to the breakup of lineages. Ideally, such an ancestral genome can be established for any well-established node in a phylogenetic tree. One such effort using 11 yeast species provided a reconstructed genome of an ancestor of the yeast lineage just prior to the whole-genome duplication (Gordon et al., 2009). With reference to such an ancestor, one can infer events that must have occurred in the respective lineages that led to the current species\xe2\x80\x99 genomes. This may provide significant insight in understanding the biology of these species in terms of adaptive evolution and the acquisition of species-specific traits. Given the relative ease in molecular genetic manipulation of most fungi in the Saccharomyces complex, this wealth of novel information may direct our roads of research to study the functional relevance of alterations detected by comparative genomics (Rusche and Rine 2010). The genus Eremothecium has been assigned to clade 12 of the Saccharomyces complex (Kurtzman and Robnett 2003). With Ashbya gossypii, this genus contains an industrially important species for the production of riboflavin (vitamin B2). The molecular biology involved in riboflavin production has been studied for many years in A. gossypii. This led to the identification of pathways required for providing GTP as a central precursor for riboflavin biogenesis (F\xc3\xb6rster et al., 1999; Jimenez et al., 2005; Mateos et al., 2006). In addition, interest in Ashbya was spurred by the unusual filamentous growth mode within the Saccharomyces complex (Wendland and Philippsen 2001). Current hypotheses favor the notion that an Eremothecium ancestor has gained the potential to generate true hyphae instead of employing pseudohyphal growth (Schmitz and Philippsen 2011). Therefore, studying the Eremothecium genus in more detail may provide us with molecular insight on which steps may have been involved to establish filamentous growth in this genus. E. cymbalariae, Eremothecium ashbyi, and A. gossypii are filamentous fungi that share a rare growth mode that includes dichotomous tip branching. Eremothecium ashbyi and A. gossypii are both flavinogenic species in terms of their ability to overproduce and secrete riboflavin, whereas E. cymbalariae is not an overproducer (Sengupta and Chandra 2011). Furthermore, the 8.7 Mb A. gossypii genome provided compelling evidence for whole-genome duplication in the S. cerevisiae lineage. This could be established based on the 2:1 mapping of S. cerevisiae loci to blocks of A. gossypii genes (Dietrich et al., 2004). Similar 2:1 assignments have subsequently been reported for other unduplicated yeast genomes as well (Dujon et al. 2004; Kellis et al., 2004). Using evolutionary genomics, we sought to close the gap between whole-genome duplication in one branch of the Saccharomyces lineage giving rise to a modern 12 Mb genome of S. cerevisiae and A. gossypii with one of the smallest genomes of a free living eukaryote in another. To this end, we determined the complete genome sequence of E. cymbalariae and annotated the predicted gene models. In a comparative approach, we elucidated the relationship of E. cymbalariae with the reconstructed yeast ancestor established by the Wolfe group and the A. gossypii genome (Dietrich et al., 2004; Gordon et al., 2009).'","b'We used comparative genomics to elucidate the genome evolution within the pre\xe2\x80\x93whole-genome duplication genus Eremothecium.

In a comparative approach, we elucidated the relationship of E. cymbalariae with the reconstructed yeast ancestor established by the Wolfe group and the A. gossypii genome (Dietrich et al., 2004; Gordon et al., 2009). Eremothecium cymbalariae strain DBVPG #7215 was sequenced. E. cymbalariae is the type strain of the genus Eremothecium and was identified by Borzi in 1888 (Borzi 1888). Cells were grown using complete media (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% dextrose). E. cymbalariae genomic DNA was prepared according to Guthrie and Fink (1991). Instead of enzymatic digestion of the cell wall, grinding in liquid nitrogen was chosen. The DNA was prepared for next-generation sequencing at LGC Genomics (Berlin, Germany). Sequencing generated 1,000,000 reads on a 454 Roche GS FLX Titanium Sequencer. With an average of 400 bases per read, a total of \xe2\x88\xbc400 Mb of high-quality sequence data corresponding to a 40\xc3\x97 coverage of the E. cymbalariae genome was produced. Primary assembly of the genome data resulted in 209 contigs, the largest of which was >500 kb. The average contig size was 45 kb. Next, a fosmid library with a standard insert size of 30 kb was generated based on the pCC2FOS vector (Epicenter Biotechnologies, Madison, WI). From this library, paired-end reads of 750 fosmids were generated. Mapping these reads to the original contigs resulted in the generation of 35 supercontigs or scaffolds. Gaps within these scaffolds were closed by primer walking on the fosmid clones. Remaining gaps between supercontigs were closed by generating and sequencing PCR products. Gap closure was completed in parallel with genome annotation to make use of syntenic relationships between the E. cymbalariae genome and the genome of A. gossypii or S. cerevisiae, or by inferring reciprocal translocations. This procedure yielded eight contigs corresponding to the eight chromosomes of E. cymbalariae. The eight chromosomes of the E. cymbalariae genome were annotated and submitted to the EMBL/GenBank Data Libraries with accession numbers CP002497\xe2\x80\x93CP002504. The mitochondrial genome has not been retrieved. Available fragments of the mitochondrial genome did not assemble the full mitochondrial genome at his stage. There is one region on CHR4 in the E. cymbalariae genome that carries the rDNA repeats (supporting information, Figure S3). The E. cymbalariae genome was compared with the A. gossypii and S. cerevisiae genomes available from AGD (Ashbya Genome Database, http://agd.vital-it.ch/index.html) and SGD (Saccharomyces Genome Database, http://www.yeastgenome.org) using local BLAST tools (available at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Using top-ranked hits, this produced a draft annotation of the E. cymbalariae genome. Fine annotation of the E. cymbalariae genome used syntenic relationships to A. gossypii and S. cerevisiae, as well as conservation of gene order with the reconstructed ancestral yeast genome. E. cymbalariae ORFs that did not occur in either of the genomes used for comparison were searched against the nonredundant dataset of NCBI. There are, however, 44 hypothetical ORFs for which no homolog could be identified. The identification of introns was mainly based on their conservation within homologous genes. The current annotation was reinvestigated intensively to provide an as correct as possible initial characterization of the E. cymbalariae genome. Identification of SPO16 as Ecym_2083a was based on synteny. However, this gene contains an intron, and the weak similarity of EcymSpo16 with its A. gossypii homolog made us miss this gene during the extensive annotation period; it was found only by specifically searching for this ZMM-family protein in E. cymbalariae. This clarifies how inevitable changes and the annotation of newly identified genes within the current nomenclature will be dealt with. EcymSPO16/Ecym_2083a can be found on CHR2 between the genes Ecym_2083 and Ecym_2084. E. cymbalariae was isolated and first described in 1888 by Borzi as a novel and very interesting fungus because of its systematic position (Borzi 1888). The genus name refers to the characteristic sporangia formed scarcely and in a solitary fashion at the tip of aerial hyphae. Eremothecium species today are grouped into clade 12 of the Saccharomyces complex according to Kurtzman and Robnett (2003) (Figure 1A). Both E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii are filamentous fungi that branch dichotomously at hyphal tips and thus can easily be distinguished from the dimorphic representatives in this genus, Holleya sinecauda and E. coryli (Schade et al., 2003; Gastmann et al., 2007). However, E. cymbalariae generates a fluffy aerial mycelium unique in this genus and in contrast to synnemata formed by A. gossypii. Additionally, E. cymbalariae mycelia are white, indicating a lack of riboflavin overproduction obvious from the yellow-colored A. gossypii mycelium (Figure 1B). E. cymbalariae forms only scarce sporangia, whereas A. gossypii produces abundant sporangia and spores. E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii spores differ in size and shape (Figure 1C). Whereas E. cymbalariae spores are on average 13 \xc2\xb5m long and can be readily separated from each other, A. gossypii spores are more than twice as long and clump together via terminal filaments (Figure 1C). This has hampered efforts to set up mutagenic screens with A. gossypii because of the inability to isolate single spores. Interestingly, spore morphology of A. gossypii resembles that of the dimorphic relative E. coryli (Gastmann et al., 2007). Comparison of Eremothecium cymbalariae with Ashbya gossypii. (A) Phylogenetic tree of selected species from the Saccharomyces complex based on 18S rDNA. The dot indicates the whole-genome duplication (WGD). Clade assignments are according to Kurtzman and Robnett (2003). (B) Fluffy aerial mycelial growth of E. cymbalariae compared with compact mycelial growth of the riboflavin overproducer A. gossypii (wrinkles indicate areas of strong hyphal adhesion). (C) Morphology of spores of A. gossypii (top) and E. cymbalariae (bottom). (D) Distribution of amino acid identities of all E. cymbalariae protein coding genes compared with the A. gossypii protein set. (E) Venn diagram indicating the distribution of homologous vs. non-homologous genes in both genomes. Genes occurring either in A. gossypii or E. cymbalariae may share homologs in S. cerevisiae or other yeasts as indicated. We sequenced the E. cymbalariae genome with up to 40\xc3\x97 coverage, and on the basis of the 9.7 Mb complete genome sequence, we annotated 4712 genes, which is very similar to the 4718 genes of A. gossypii and the 4824 genes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Dietrich et al., 2004, Wood et al., 2002). Details of the sequencing of the E. cymbalariae genome (accession numbers CP002497\xe2\x80\x93CP002504) and supporting information are available in Materials and Methods and Table S1. The conservation of protein sequences between syntenic homologs of E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii varies considerably, ranging from 20 to 100%. Highly conserved genes include, for example, ribosomal proteins (Figure 1D). On average, there is a 60% identity between E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii proteins. This was surprising, as it indicates quite some evolutionary distance. This divergence is in a range of the S. cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis species pair. For comparison, in Saccharomyces sensu stricto species, the level of protein identity is >85% (Cliften et al., 2001). Especially the set of Eremothecium proteins that share only a low level of sequence identity may be informative of rapidly evolving proteins or processes that may warrant further study. On the other hand, 97% of all protein-encoding genes of E. cymbalariae share a homolog in A. gossypii. This leaves about 150 genes in each of the genomes not shared between E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii (Figure 1E). In the initial annotation of the Ashbya genome, \xe2\x88\xbc250 genes were found that do not have a homolog in S. cerevisiae. Comparing this set with the E. cymbalariae gene set indicates that most of these so-called NOHBYs (no homology in baker\xe2\x80\x99s yeast) actually share a homolog in both Eremothecium species. We mapped the completed genome of E. cymbalariae to eight contigs corresponding to eight chromosomes, in contrast to only seven chromosomes in A. gossypii. Using syntenic gene arrangements between E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii, we were able to identify seven E. cymbalariae centromeres, which were designated CEN1 to CEN7, and the corresponding chromosomes, CHR1 to CHR7, respectively. This differs from the annotation in A. gossypii, which numbered the chromosomes according to size, with CHR1 being the smallest. E. cymbalariae CEN8 was identified based on synteny to S. cerevisiae centromere loci on CHRX and CHRXII (Figure 2). The arrangement of the E. cymbalariae CEN8 locus indicates that in A. gossypii both chromosomal arms of the ancestral CHR8 were translocated to two positions on other A. gossypii chromsomes, i.e. the telomeres of A. gossypii chromosomes I and III, with concomitant loss of CEN8 but without any loss of genes. This mechanism of reduction in chromosome numbers is contrasted by all other cases in the Saccharomyces complex, in which telomere-to-telomere fusion of two chromosomes with subsequent loss of one of the centromeres was suggested to be predominant (Gordon et al., 2011). Deviations from the number of eight chromosomes of the yeast ancestor have been found in pre\xe2\x80\x93whole-genome duplication yeasts, e.g. Kluyveromyces lactis (six chromosomes) and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (seven chromosomes). In post-WGD species, there are also deviations from 16 chromosomes, such as in Candida glabrata and Naumovia castellii (Dujon et al., 2004; Gordon et al., 2009, 2011; Souciet et al. 2009). This indicates that chromosome reduction was not the speciation event that distinguished the Eremothecium lineage from the other pre-WGD clades of the Saccharomyces complex, as eight ancestral chromosomes can still be found in E. cymbalariae, although a reduction to seven chromosomes in the genome of the A. gossypii ancestor could have separated this lineage from E. cymbalariae. Chromosome assignment for all E. cymbalariae chromosomes based on synteny. Chromosomes 1 to 7 were assigned based on conserved centromere regions between E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii. A. gossypii systematic nomenclature is used. Arrows indicate transcriptional orientation of genes. Arrows for centromeres indicate orientation of Centromeric DNA Elements (CDEI-CDEII-CDEIII). E. cymbalariae centromeric region of CHR4 contains two genes that are homologous to S. cerevisiae genes but are absent in A. gossypii. CEN8 was identified based on synteny to S. cerevisiae genes at centromere loci CHRX and CHRXII. CEN8 has been eliminated in A. gossypii, and the chromosomal arms have been translocated to CHR1 and CHR3, respectively. Point-like centromeres appeared already in the common ancestor of pre- and post-WGD species. Thus, centromeric DNA elements, CDEI, CDEII, and CDEIII are found to be highly conserved in the Saccharomyces complex (Gordon et al., 2011). There is strong conservation between E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii centromeres, as could be expected of two closely related species. In particular, the CDEII region is \xe2\x88\xbc160 bp and thus twice as large as in S. cerevisiae (Figure S1). We identified 9 out of 16 telomeres of the E. cymbalariae genome. Thus, the E. cymbalariae genome currently lacks sequences at 7 chromosomal ends. With the available sequence information, we could determine the telomere repeat of E. cymbalariae as a 24 bp repeat sequence. It is characterized by tandem duplications of the sequence (CACACCGCTGAGAGACCCGTACAC)n. This repeat sequence differs from the telomere repeat of A. gossypii by a single base (Figure 3A). The only nontelomere copy of these repeats is in the putative EcymTLC1 gene, which represents the RNA template component of telomerase. We identified this feature based on synteny to the ancestral TLC1 locus and also via comparison with S. cerevisiae and A. gossypii (Figure 3B). Identification of telomere repeats in E. cymbalariae. (A) Based on the identification of 9 out of 16 telomeres, the E. cymbalariae telomere repeat structure could be inferred. The 24 bp repeat of E. cymbalariae differs at a single position from the telomere repeat of A. gossypii. (B) In S. cerevisiae, the RNA component of telomerase is encoded by TLC1. This feature is located between YBR035C and YBR036C on CHRII. The E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii TLC1 genes are found at syntenic positions. E. cymbalariae TLC1 is located on CHR6 and additionally shares a gene with the deduced ancestor that is not found in A. gossypii or S. cerevisiae. Even though our assembled sequence does not reach into telomere repeats, in seven cases a comparison with the reconstructed ancestor indicates that the terminal genes in this reconstructed ancestral genome were identified also in E. cymbalariae. Thus, even though the reconstruction of the ancestral genome is preliminary due to the more frequent recombination events at telomere loci, we believe that based on our high sequence coverage we may not have missed a large number of genes. E. cymbalariae, like A. gossypii, does not harbor repetitive sequence elements such as S. cerevisiae Y\xe2\x80\xb2 elements at subtelomere regions. In other fungal model systems, such as Magnaporthe oryzae and Ustilago maydis, telomere-linked helicase gene families have been described, which are encoded by genes bearing similarity to the helicase genes of Y\xe2\x80\xb2 elements (Farman 2007). In S. cerevisiae, these subtelomeric regions are hotspots of variation (Louis and Vershinin 2005). S. cerevisiae has accumulated several gene families at telomere regions. Particularly, genes of the SUC (invertase), MAL (maltose utilization), MEL (melibiose utilization), and FLO (flocculation) families, which are important for the fermentative life style of yeast, are clustered at telomeres (Teunissen and Steensma 1995). Dispersal of these genes among different S. cerevisiae telomeres has been facilitated by rearrangements at chromosome ends. In the A. gossypii genome, several duplicated genes can be found at telomere loci [e.g. JEN1 on the right arm of chromosome I (TEL1R) and the left arm of chromosome II (TEL2L), OPT2 on TEL3L and TEL4L], and tandem duplications of telomere-associated genes can be found (e.g. a OAF1 triplication near TEL4R or the distribution of mating-type loci at TEL4R and TEL5R) (Table S3B and see below). This provides evidence for sequence amplification by chromosomal rearrangements in A. gossypii, which we did not observe in E. cymbalariae. We currently lack understanding of a sexual cycle in A. gossypii. A. gossypii produces spores that carry a single haploid nucleus. This feature is particularly useful in isolating homokaryotic mutants. Spores can germinate into a mycelium that can produce spores itself without requiring a mating partner. Thus A. gossypii may be homothallic (Wendland and Walther 2005). The A. gossypii strain that was sequenced was found to harbor three identical mating-type cassettes containing MATa information. In S. cerevisiae, mating type is determined by the expression of MATa or MAT\xce\xb1 mating-type genes residing at the MAT locus (Figure 4). The active mating-type locus is on CHRIII of S. cerevisiae. At the telomeres of CHRIII, silent mating-type cassettes HML\xce\xb1 and HMRa are located. These loci can serve as templates for mating-type switching induced by HO-mediated DSB formation at the MAT locus (Haber 1998). In the A. gossypii and E. cymbalariae genome [as in other preduplication genomes, with the potential exception of K. lactis (Fabre et al., 2005)], there is no homolog of the Ho-endonuclease. We found that E. cymbalariae harbors a conserved array of mating-type loci on CHR1 as found in S. cerevisiae CHRIII and in K. lactis (Figure 4). E. cymbalariae MATa encodes two genes, MATa1 and MATa2, whereas MAT\xce\xb1 encodes MAT\xce\xb11 and MAT\xce\xb12. The genes flanking the MAT loci are conserved between E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii. We recently analyzed several components of the mating pheromone signal transduction cascade in A. gossypii and showed that deletion of, for example, AgSTE2 and AgSTE3 does not inhibit sporulation. Deletion of the downstream transcription factor AgSTE12, on the other hand, resulted in increased sporulation. We also noted differences in genes encoding the A. gossypii \xce\xb1-factor pheromone. In S. cerevisiae and E. cymbalariae, there are two genes each encoding pre-proproteins containing several repeats of the mature respective \xce\xb1-factors. In A. gossypii, one of the homologous MF\xce\xb1 genes does not contain a mature \xce\xb1-factor peptide, whereas the second gene harbors only a single peptide (Wendland et al., 2011). Thus, there are striking differences between E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii concerning the organization of mating-type loci and in the genes involved in pheromone signaling (see also below). This actually makes E. cymbalariae an interesting model to investigate sexual reproduction in the filamentous Eremothecium species (e.g. concerning mating-type switching, pheromone signaling, and meiosis). Comparative organization of mating-type loci and conserved flanking genes in Saccharomycetes. MATa loci are boxed in gray, MAT\xce\xb1 loci in yellow. E. cymbalariae shares the chromosomal arrangement of a MAT locus and two cassettes (HML\xce\xb1 and HMRa) with S. cerevisiae and K. lactis. Genes flanking the mating-type loci are conserved between E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii. Both species have lost three genes (S. cerevisiae homologs of YJL206c, YJL207c, and SLA2) found at the K. lactis MAT locus. MATa on A. gossypii CHR6 is in a region of block synteny with the E. cymbalariae MAT\xce\xb1 on CHR1. Both telomeres of A. gossypii CHR6 are known and do not harbor additional mating-type cassettes. A unique feature of the A. gossypii genome within the Saccharomyces complex is its high GC content of 52% (Dietrich et al., 2004). In contrast, we found that the GC content of E. cymbalariae with only 40% is similar to that of S. cerevisiae (38.3%) and other hemiascomycetous yeasts. Generally, the GC content around centromere regions (and at some telomeres) is lower than average in both E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii (Figure S2). A decrease in GC around centromere loci was noted also for other species. This may facilitate the identification of centromeres in species that do not have conserved point-like centromere structure (Gordon et al., 2011). It was also noted that directional mutational pressure could result in evolutionary changes of GC content (Sueoka 1988). Recently it was suggested that gene conversion (i.e. the repair of double-strand breaks, DSB) is GC-biased in many eukaryotes including mammals (Duret and Galtier 2009; Galtier, 2003; Marais 2003). Interestingly, in the yeast Lachancea kluyveri, the 1 Mb left arm of chromosome C shows a significantly higher GC content (52.9%) compared with the rest of the genome (40.4%), which may have been caused by an ancient hybridization event or by progressive GC content increase similar to a GC-biased repair. It was also noted that this arm is delayed in replication compared with the rest of the genome (Payen et al., 2009) We analyzed GC profile in E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii using a chromosome scale sliding window approach (GC profile available at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/GC-Profile/; Gao and Zhang, 2006). For all chromosomes of both species, we could establish a GC-poor trough at centromere loci (one example for each species is shown in Figure S3). These regions of reduced GC content include at least 15 kb around the centromeres. Other areas with reduced GC content can be found at telomeres. Interestingly, in A. gossypii we found another GC coldspot on CHR4 between 827451 and 847198. This region contains 10 genes in A. gossypii that are in a syntenic block conserved between the reconstructed ancestor, E. cymbalariae, and A. gossypii. The functions of homologs of these genes have been analyzed in S. cerevisiae: six of these genes are essential; two are involved in cell cycle progression and sporulation; one in endocytosis; and for one, the function is unknown (Table S2). The homologous E. cymbalariae region also has a decreased GC content of 38.3% compared with 40.4% for the whole CHR8. This may suggest that GC coldspots mark regions of chromosomes harboring important genetic elements that may be adversely affected by GC-biased recombination. Conversely, this suggests that GC hotspots may pinpoint regions of frequent recombination, which may have altered genes in those loci in a species-specific manner. More refined functional analyses of such regions, therefore, seem warranted. The genome of E. cymbalariae is 9.7 Mb and thus \xe2\x88\xbc900 kb larger than that of A. gossypii (excluding rDNA repeats; see Figure S3 and Table 1). This size difference is not based on a difference in gene number, as both Eremothecium species have about 4720 genes each. Gene density in E. cymbalariae is similar to that in S. cerevisiae with 2 kb/gene. The A. gossypii genome is more compact and gene density is <1.9 kb/gene. The size reduction of about 10% in the A. gossypii genome is due largely (>80%) to the streamlining of inter-ORF regions and far less to the extent of shortening ORFs. We found one copy of a TY3-Gypsy transposon in E. cymbalariae, which does not occur in A. gossypii. There are remnants of a potential TY3 transposon on Ashbya CHRI and CHRIII and AGL264w may resemble a bacterial transposase (Dietrich et al., 2004). Sites of transposon excision (LTRs or sigma elements) are found throughout the E. cymbalariae genome, suggesting that this transposon has been active (Table S1). Almost all E. cymbalariae genes that share homologs in A. gossypii or the reconstructed yeast ancestor are arranged in syntenic blocks. Orphan genes in both species are often associated with tRNAs or may be remnants of recombination or transposition events. We adopted a systematic nomenclature for the E. cymbalariae genome that assigns each gene the species identifier \xe2\x80\x9cEcym,\xe2\x80\x9d which is separated by an underscore from a four-digit number indicating the chromosomal location and assigning an ORF number. ORFs are numbered consecutively starting from the left telomere. Thus, Ecym_1001 designates the first ORF on chromosome 1 next to the left telomere, and similarly, Ecym_1541 will indicate the 541st ORF (last ORF) on CHR1 counted from the left telomere. In this way, we annotated the complete genome. We took into account neither the position of the centromere on a chromosome nor the transcriptional orientation of an ORF. The identification of introns in E. cymbalariae was mainly based on their conservation within homologous genes. The intron splice rules for E. cymbalariae (5\xe2\x80\xb2-GT\xe2\x80\xa6TACTAAC\xe2\x80\xa6AG-3\xe2\x80\xb2) are conserved with those of A. gossypii and S. cerevisiae (Dietrich et al., 2004, Spingola et al., 1999). This led to the identification and annotation of 232 usually small putative introns. The average intron size is 173 bp. Most of the introns are located near the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of ORFs, as was also found in A. gossypii and S. cerevisiae. This small number of introns is in line with those observed in other fungi of the Saccharomyces complex. There are only a small number of genes in which putative introns differ between E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii. These occasions, therefore, indicate intron loss in the species without introns. With more and more genomes and transcriptomes available, a comprehensive map of ancestral introns can be compiled in the future. To identify tRNA genes, tRNAscan was used (available at http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/ tRNAscan-SE/; Schattner et al., 2005). This resulted in the annotation of 143 tRNA genes. This number is comparable to the 275 tRNAs in the S. cerevisiae genome when taking the WGD into account. A. gossypii, on the other hand, has 192 annotated tRNAs. This suggests an increase in tRNA genes in A. gossypii. Only four sets of tandemly duplicated tRNAs are present in the A. gossypii genome. Comparisons of blocks of syntenic gene arrangement between A. gossypii and S. cerevisiae have indicated that endpoints of synteny clusters are often marked by tRNAs (Dietrich et al., 2004). This suggests that recombination via tRNAs as the only major source of repetitive elements in the A. gossypii genome resulted in the amplification of tRNA genes in Ashbya. Similarly, genome evolution can be driven by transposon-mediated recombination (Garfinkel 2005; Mieczkowski et al., 2006). In E. cymbalariae, the primary insertion site of its TY3 transposon is next to tRNA genes, as was described for S. cerevisiae (Chalker and Sandmeyer 1992). This makes it difficult to distinguish between TY-mediated and tRNA-mediated genome evolution in E. cymbalariae. In A. gossypii, 21 loci contain tandem duplications of two to four genes (Dietrich et al., 2004). This limited amount of duplication does not allow for large-scale subfunctionalization. Yet, for the tandem duplication of the RHO1 gene, it could be shown that changing a single position in the switch I region allows for a different regulation of these Rho proteins (K\xc3\xb6hli et al., 2008). In comparison, we found only eight of these tandem duplications to be conserved in E. cymbalariae (Table S3A). Several tandem duplicated A. gossypii genes are located at telomeres and are either not present or not duplicated in E. cymbalariae. This suggests species-specific changes and variability at telomeric positions in A. gossypii, which we have not found in E. cymbalariae. We investigated the synteny relationships between the E. cymbalariae genome to both the yeast ancestor and A. gossypii (Figure 5). The E. cymbalariae genome can be mapped to the ancestor with 252 blocks of synteny and to A. gossypii with 229 blocks, with an average block length of 36.8 kb and 40.8 kb, respectively (Table 2). In contrast, the A. gossypii genome was previously mapped to 271 blocks with the yeast ancestor (Gordon et al., 2009). Half of the E. cymbalariae genome size is represented in 40 blocks in the yeast ancestor and in only 38 blocks in A. gossypii. The largest blocks of synteny map to E. cymbalariae CHR2: 397 kb shared with the yeast ancestor and 340 kb with A. gossypii. There is also a large block of synteny flanking the conserved position of the rDNA repeats on E. cymbalariae CHR4, encompassing 251 kb in the yeast ancestor and 236 kb in A. gossypii (in addition to the rDNA repeats). Conservation of blocks is greater between Eremothecium species at centromeric loci. Yet, the large number of synteny blocks indicates an unexpectedly divergent genome evolution in both Eremothecium species. Once the genomes of other Eremothecium species become available, especially from the branch containing the dimorphic representatives, it may be possible to reconstruct an ancestral genome for the Eremothecium clade. For example, CHR6 of the reconstructed yeast ancestor is distribu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ed to only seven blocks in the E. cymbalariae genome, two each on CHR2, CHR3, and CHR6, and one telomeric locus on CHR7. This allows the recapitulation of the evolution of this ancestral chromosome in E. cymbalariae by inferring only four inversions and translocations (three reciprocal and one telomeric) each. Genomic block synteny between the E. cymbalariae genome and A. gossypii and the reconstructed yeast ancestor. The colored blocks indicate regions of the reconstructed ancestral yeast genome (upper row) or the A. gossypii genome (bottom row). Colors correspond to the eight CHRs of the yeast ancestor and to the seven CHRs of A. gossypii, respectively. Scale indicates lengths of the E. cymbalariae chromosomes (bp); the dot corresponds to the centromere region of each chromosome; and the star indicates the rDNA locus. The rDNA locus in A. gossypii is \xe2\x88\xbc400 kb (Wendland et al., 1999). The additional DNA at the rDNA locus will make CHR4 the largest chromosome in E. cymbalariae. Comparison of the E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii gene sets revealed that each species harbors around 150 genes that are absent in the other. Further analysis of these subsets of genes indicated that 86 A. gossypii genes absent in E. cymbalariae have homologs in S. cerevisiae and that 104 E. cymbalariae genes absent in A. gossypii share homologs in either S. cerevisiae or other related yeasts (Figure 1D, Table S4, and Table S5). The remaining genes are species-specific genes that were annotated based on their ORF lengths above cutoff. In E. cymbalariae, these genes contain ORFs from 300 to 450 bp in length. Lack of certain genes in an Eremothecium genome thus can be used to deduce species-specific evolutionary steps. These findings may then spur further functional analyses in either A. gossypii or E. cymbalariae to identify corresponding phenotypes in mutants in which such a gene has been deleted. Three major differences involving the lack of pathways of genes between E. cymbalariae and A. gossypii were found. First, E. cymbalariae harbors a set of eight genes, termed ZMM proteins (ZIP1\xe2\x80\x934, MER3, MSH4, MSH5, and SPO16), which in S. cerevisiae were shown to facilitate meiotic crossovers (Lynn et al., 2007). A. gossypii has lost most of these genes and has retained only a ZIP1 homolog. This loss of ZMM family members in A. gossypii is puzzling. Combined with our recent analysis on the pheromone signaling cascade, this observation lets us question the existence of a sexual cycle (particularly one requiring mating and meiosis) in A. gossypii (Wendland et al., 2011). On the other hand, with E. cymbalariae we now have an Eremothecium model in which we can analyze processes of mating-type switching, the role of MATa/\xce\xb1 for cell-type\xe2\x80\x93specific gene expression, the role of pheromone signaling, and meiosis and sporulation. Second, the E. cymbalariae genome does not encode a member of the MNN1 gene family of \xce\xb1-1,3-mannosyltransferases. This family of five genes is present in both S. cerevisiae and A. gossypii and is required for adding the fourth and fifth mannose residue to a linear chain of O-glycosylated proteins (Romero et al., 1999; Lussier et al., 1999). Cell-cell adhesion via flocculins in S. cerevisiae requires binding of mannose residues (Goossens and Willaert, 2010; Bauer et al., 2010; Verstrepen and Klis 2006). Remarkably, the mycelium of E. cymbalariae and particularly the aerial hyphae show a penetrant lack of cell-cell adhesion, in contrast to the strong adhesion of A. gossypii hyphae. Therefore, E. cymbalariae may be a promising fungal model system to study adhesion, particularly with respect to the role of individual flocculation genes in protein-protein\xe2\x80\x93mediated cell adhesion. Third, in the E. cymbalariae genome we found a lack of genes belonging to the Ehrlich pathway of fusel acids/fusel alcohol production from amino acids. Key genes of this pathway include the transcriptional activator Aro80 and two downstream target genes ARO9 and ARO10 driving the first two steps of transamination and decarboxylation of amino acids to produce fusel aldehydes. Conversion of these aldehydes into either fusel acids or fusel alcohols is mediated by ALD and ADH gene families encoding aldehyde dehydrogenases or alcohol dehydrogenases, respectively (Hazelwood et al., 2008). The ARO9, ARO10, and ARO80 genes are not encoded in the E. cymbalariae genome. In addition, the PDC5 gene, which encodes an alternative decarboxylase, the aldo-keto reductase YPR1, and PDR12, which encodes an ABC transporter involved in the export of fusel acids, are absent in E. cymbalariae. A. gossypii encodes all of these genes, with the exception of ARO9. Fusel alcohol production has an impact on morphogenesis in S. cerevisiae as, for example, isoamyl alcohol, phenylethanol, and tryptophol can induce pseudohyphal growth and stimulate flocculation (Kern et al., 2004; Chen and Fink,2006,). Deletion of ARO8, ARO9, or ARO80 renders S. cerevisiae cells defective in haploid invasive growth and diploid pseudohyphal formation. These compounds, therefore, can act as quorum-sensing molecules. Similar systems are utilized in other yeast species. In Candida albicans, for example, farnesol leads to the inhibition of filamentation at high cell densities (Hornby et al., 2001). Analysis of the flavor profiles of A. gossypii and E. cymbalariae are currently underway. A. gossypii produces far more aromatic compounds than E. cymbalariae, evident from a very fruity flavor. A. gossypii may produce these compounds to attract insects as part of its dispersal strategy. E. cymbalariae is rather unimpressive in terms of flavor production. Interestingly, lack of Ehrlich pathway genes can also be observed in Kluyveromyces waltii, which lacks, for example, the ARO80 transcription factor according to the Yeast Gene Order Browser information (Byrne and Wolfe 2005). Our study demonstrates the power of comparative genomics to elucidate the evolutionary history of closely related species. The genome of E. cymbalariae harbors several features in common with the reconstructed yeast ancestor that have been lost in A. gossypii. In particular, we found the presence of eight chromosomes, similar gene densities, and an overall low GC content. Furthermore, in E. cymbalariae as in other yeasts, a mating-type locus and a cassette organization including silent cassettes at both telomeres can be found on one dedicated chromosome. In addition, we found a TY3 transposon and ZMM family genes required for meiotic crossovers in E. cymbalariae, which are absent from A. gossypii. With these characteristics, E. cymbalariae marks a missing link in the evolution from a yeast ancestor to A. gossypii. Several Eremothecium-specific traits were discovered in addition to the filamentous growth mode, including the telomeric repeats and conserved flanks at mating-type loci. We speculate that the E. cymbalariae\xe2\x80\x93specific loss of \xce\xb1-1,3-mannosyltransferases and of key Ehrlich pathway genes may contribute to the lack of cell-cell adhesion observed in this fungal species. On the other hand, specific evolutionary steps in A. gossypii, which have yet to be uncovered, have turned this species into an oversporulator in comparison with E. cymbalariae and into an overproducer of riboflavin. Both features are linked, as riboflavin production is increased at the end of the growth phase concomitantly with sporulation (Stahmann et al., 2001). Comparative genomics is a very powerful tool to reveal specific features of closely related species not only in, for example, the Saccharomyces complex but also in other systems as demonstrated for the Ustilago maydis/Sporisorium reilianum species pair (Schirawski et al., 2010). We thank the Philippsen and Dietrich groups for providing AGD at http://agd.vital-it.ch/index.html and the Duke CGT Ashbya website at http://ashbya.genome.duke.edu/blast.html, which was extensively used for annotation of the E. cymbalariae genome.

Araya', 'Stanley Fields']","December 8, 2011.",Genome-Wide Analysis of Nascent Transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"b'The assessment of transcriptional regulation requires a genome-wide survey of active RNA polymerases. Thus, we combined the nuclear run-on assay, which labels and captures nascent transcripts, with high-throughput DNA sequencing to examine transcriptional activity in exponentially growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sequence read data from these nuclear run-on libraries revealed that transcriptional regulation in yeast occurs not only at the level of RNA polymerase recruitment to promoters but also at postrecruitment steps. Nascent synthesis signals are strongly enriched at TSS throughout the yeast genome, particularly at histone loci. Nascent transcripts reveal antisense transcription for more than 300 genes, with the read data providing support for the activity of distinct promoters driving transcription in opposite directions rather than bidirectional transcription from single promoters. By monitoring total RNA in parallel, we found that transcriptional activity accounts for 80% of the variance in transcript abundance. We computed RNA stabilities from nascent and steady-state transcripts for each gene and found that the most stable and unstable transcripts encode proteins whose functional roles are consistent with these stabilities. We also surveyed transcriptional activity after heat shock and found that most, but not all, heat shock-inducible genes increase their abundance by increasing their RNA synthesis. In summary, this study provides a genome-wide view of RNA polymerase activity in yeast, identifies regulatory steps in the synthesis of transcripts, and analyzes transcript stabilities.Changes in mRNA steady-state levels reflect the combined effect of changes in RNA synthesis and degradation. Thus, measurement of only steady-state transcript levels provides an incomplete view of transcriptional regulation. Proper control of transcription is achieved by regulation at several steps: (1) preinitiation complex assembly; (2) promoter escape (or early elongation); (3) productive elongation; and (4) transcription termination (Fuda et al. 2009). Although the spatial distribution of RNA polymerase II can be used to assess transcriptional regulation, polymerase occupancy alone, as detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation, cannot discriminate between polymerases that are simply bound to promoters and those that are transcriptionally engaged. For example, yeast RNA polymerase II associates with many transcriptionally inactive promoters (Radonjic et al. 2005). The nuclear run-on (NRO) assay traditionally has been used to assess the transcription of individual genes (Brown et al. 1984; Gariglio et al. 1981) and remains the most reliable method of directly measuring transcriptional activity. This method consists of (1) isolation of cell nuclei; (2) isotopic labeling of nascent RNA; and (3) hybridization of labeled RNA to a slot blot, which is then exposed to film.

In summary, we present a high-resolution view of yeast transcription that discriminates among different modes of transcriptional regulation. S. cerevisiae strain BY4742 was used (Brachmann et al. 1998). BY4742 was grown in yeast extract-peptone dextrose medium (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) at 30\xc2\xb0 to exponential growth phase (OD600 = 0.5\xe2\x88\x920.6). NRO assays were performed as described (Garcia-Martinez et al. 2004) by the use of approximately 107 cells. In vitro transcription was performed with 12 \xc2\xb5L of biotin-16-UTP (10 mM; Roche) instead of 13 \xc2\xb5L of [\xce\xb1-33P]UTP. Total RNA was extracted with hot phenol, treated with Turbo DNase I that was passed through CentriSpin columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ). An aliquot of total RNA was used for total RNA library construction (see Materials and Methods, Total RNA library construction). Biotinylated RNA was precipitated from total RNA with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Binding was performed in 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid and 1 M NaCl for 20 min at 42\xc2\xb0 and 2 hr at room temperature with rotation as described (Patrone et al. 2000). Beads were first washed three times with 800 \xc2\xb5L of binding buffer and then washed twice with 800 \xc2\xb5L 2x saline sodium citrate (SSC)/15% formamide buffer for 15 min, followed by a 5-min wash in 800 \xc2\xb5L 2x SSC. The beads were then washed twice more with 2x SSC with 15% formamide followed by a wash with 2x SSC and a final wash with TE buffer. RNA was eluted from beads by adding 50 \xc2\xb5L of 10 \xce\xbcM ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid /95% formamide and incubation at 65\xc2\xb0 for 5 min. Eluted RNA was precipitated, fragmented (Ambion Fragmentation kit; Ambion, Austin, TX), and used for strand-specific Illumina sequencing library preparation as described (Parkhomchuk et al. 2009). In brief, this protocol relies on marking the second strand with dUTP during synthesis followed by its degradation after adaptor ligation and size selection. A comparative analysis of strand-specific RNA sequencing methods (Levin et al. 2010) identified this method as leading by performance across tested criteria. DNA libraries were submitted for 36-bp single-end sequencing.

Total RNA was treated with Turbo DNase I, fragmented (Ambion Fragmentation kit) and used for Illumina sequencing library preparation as described (Parkhomchuk et al. 2009). In brief, approximately 50 ng of total RNA was used for first-strand synthesis with random hexamers. After subsequent removal of dNTPs with NucAway Spin Columns (Ambion), second-strand synthesis was performed in the presence of dUTP. Double-stranded cDNA was purified with the PureLink PCR purification kit (Invitrogen) and subjected to end repair, A-tailing, and adaptor ligation steps. DNA libraries were fractionated on a nondenaturing 1x TBE, 6% acrylamide gel (Invitrogen), and fragments between 250 and 350 bp were excised from the gel and eluted by incubation in TE at room temperature with vigorous shaking for 30 min. Uridine-containing, second-strand synthesis products were digested with Uracil-N-Glycosylase (Applied Biosystems). Libraries were amplified via 16 PCR cycles. PCR products were cleaned (Invitrogen PureLink, Agencourt AMPure XP; Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA) and submitted for 36-bp single-end sequencing. Two different regions of Arabidopsis thaliana ELF3 gene were transcribed in vitro either in the presence of UTP or B16UTP. B16UTP- and UTP-labeled transcripts from two regions were mixed at approximately 109 copies and added to 50 \xce\xbcg of yeast total RNA as spike-in controls. The selection experiments were performed in triplicates to obtain average Cp values. Fold of enrichment (f) of B16UTP-RNA over nonspecifically bound UTP-RNA on streptavidin beads was calculated on the basis of the differences in their Cp values and adjusted by the differences in Cp values observed in their corresponding inputs: We aligned quality control-filtered reads from the NRO and total RNA libraries to the UCSC sacCer2 reference genome by using Maq (http://maq.sourceforge.net) with default parameters and filtered to retain high confidence alignments (mapping quality \xe2\x89\xa5 30). The quality-filtered alignments were used to compile a strand-specific measure of abundance for transcribed bases in the genome, normalized by the total number of bases acquired per experiment. Alignments from biological replicates were merged by use of the mapmerge function in Maq and processed equally. All reads were 36 bp long. To define bases in the genome that can be unequivocally covered by reads, we identified all unique 36 base sequences from both strands of the reference assembly. We defined mappable bases as all positions covered by these sequences. The normalized per-base read depth from NRO and total RNA libraries was mapped to a collection of previously annotated features that do not overlap in the same strand, including genes with known transcription start and end sites, as well as genes with unknown transcription starts and ends, and noncoding RNAs (Nagalakshmi et al. 2008). For each feature, transcriptional activity was measured as the average normalized read depth in mappable, nonintronic bases (\xe2\x80\x9cread density\xe2\x80\x9d). Similarly, we derived a background RNA sequencing rate for each data set as the average minimum read depth in a collection of intergenic regions. The significance of the read density for each feature was calculated against the Poisson distribution of read depth per base expected from the background. A P-value significance cutoff of 0.01 was applied. The cumulative read depth along each transcript was calculated to examine the rate of transcription along transcript models. For each position i from the TSS, the cumulative read depth Ci represents the sum of bases sequenced from the TSS to i. The cumulative read depth at each position (Ci) was normalized by the total read bases in the transcript model to obtain the fraction (Fci) of the total read depth in the model acquired up to each position i. Transcript model sizes were homogenized to allow comparisons between models of different length. Sizes were adjusted by maintaining the per-base values from the first and last 100 bp of the model and adjusting the intervening values to a 1000-bp segment. Thus, the fractional cumulative NRO read depths along the uniformly sized models represent the amount of transcriptional activity that has occurred as a function of position in the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 to 3\xe2\x80\xb2 direction of the transcript model. For each gene, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) from uniformly sized models by using normalized (Fci) and non-normalized (Ci) cumulative read depth data and 10,000 simulated AUCs (non-normalized). Simulations were performed by randomly placing the observed number of transcript reads within the model and summing the contributions in cumulative read depth of each alignment to the size-adjusted transcript model. The significance of the observed AUC for each transcript model was assessed against the distribution of simulated AUCs under the null hypothesis that transcription occurs evenly throughout the model. Genes were ranked by their normalized AUC values (i.e. based on Fci curves). Gene ontology analysis for subsets of gene lists was performed with the GO TermFinder (http://yeastgenome.org/) with a P-value significance cutoff of 0.01 and a 5% FDR threshold. Analysis of GO term enrichment near the top and bottom of genes ranked by their ratios of transcription activity and transcript abundance (supporting information, Table S3 and Table S4) were performed with GOrilla (Eden et al. 2009). Raw Illumina reads are available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo as series GSE33136. We established a genome-wide NRO assay for yeast consisting of the following steps: (1) permeabilization of yeast cells with sarcosyl to deplete endogenous nucleotides and stall transcription complexes on chromosomes; (2) reactivation of transcription to extend and label newly synthesized RNA transcripts with biotin-modified UTP; (3) isolation of biotin-modified RNA on streptavidin beads; (4) elution of enriched RNA from beads; and (5) construction of strand-specific high-throughput sequencing libraries (Figure 1A). To assess the extent of nonspecific binding of RNA to streptavidin beads and to optimize conditions for the NRO steps, we performed parallel NRO reactions with biotin-UTP and, as a control, with UTP. Triplicates of both reactions were processed in parallel through the steps of binding, washing, and eluting from streptavidin beads. To measure the enrichment of biotinylated RNA, we performed quantitative PCR on the eluted RNA as well as on the input RNA. The signals from biotin-UTP-containing RNA and UTP-containing RNA were first normalized to their corresponding signal from input (see the Materials and Methods) and then used to calculate the fold enrichment of biotinylated transcripts over nonbiotinylated ones for three highly expressed yeast genes (RDN18, ACT1, and RPL28). The NRO assay conditions were optimized to reduce total RNA background to 4%\xe2\x80\x9311% (Table S1). In addition, we performed NRO reactions spiking in controls consisting of two regions of the Arabidopsis thaliana ELF3 RNA that had been transcribed in vitro either in the presence of UTP or biotin-UTP (Table S2). Together these quantitative PCR experiments demonstrated that total RNA represents between 2.6% and 11% of the NRO libraries and that therefore nascent RNA constitutes between approximately 89% and 97% of the NRO samples. By using a standard curve from known amounts of in vitro synthesized, biotin-labeled RNA, we estimate that the starting amount of biotinylated nascent transcripts in RNA extracts before affinity selection comprises approximately 0.05%. Thus, we calculate that after selection nascent RNA has been enriched by a factor of at least 89/0.05, or approximately 1,800-fold, relative to its starting level. A strategy for the genome-wide analysis of nascent transcription. (A) Schematic of the NRO assay. Transcription complexes are stalled on genomic DNA by depleting endogenous nucleotide triphosphates via permeabilization of yeast cells with sarcosyl. Reactivation of transcription is achieved by providing biotin-UTP and other nucleotides and switching transcription reactions from ice to 30\xc2\xb0 for 5 min, followed by extraction of total RNA that contains both steady-state and nascent biotinylated transcripts. A fraction of the total RNA is used for total RNA library preparation. Newly synthesized biotinylated RNAs are isolated from total RNA via streptavidin pull-downs to prepare the NRO sample. Both NRO and total RNA strand-specific Illumina sequencing libraries are constructed and submitted for 36 bp single-end sequencing. (B, C) After mapping reads to the reference genome and quality-filtering alignments, the read density is computed from NRO and total RNA data in 4,285 genes with fully distinguishable transcript models (i.e. that do not overlap on the same strand). These measurements of transcript synthesis and transcript abundance for each gene are found to be robust between NRO (B) and total RNA (C) replicates. To examine RNA polymerase II activity and monitor transcript abundance throughout the genome, we constructed both NRO and total RNA libraries. Total RNA libraries were prepared from aliquots of the biotin-UTP-treated NRO sample by excluding the steps of nascent RNA selection on streptavidin beads (Figure 1A). Strand-specific Illumina sequencing libraries were built from RNA isolated from three independent cultures of log phase yeast (Parkhomchuk et al. 2009). We acquired 63 million and 83 million 36 base-pair reads from the NRO and total RNA libraries, respectively. After aligning reads to the genome, we filtered out low-quality alignments and rRNA sequences; because we carried out the protocols without an rRNA depletion step, rRNA sequences accounted for more than 90% of the total reads. After filtering, approximately 2.5 million uniquely mapped NRO reads and approximately 1 million total RNA reads were left (Table S3). This combined approach allowed us to measure the amount of nascent transcripts as well as steady-state transcripts in parallel. To analyze sequencing results for both NRO and total RNA samples, we defined read depth as the number of sequencing reads acquired per base, normalized by the total bases sequenced for that sample. We summed the read depth values for each mappable, non-intronic base within a transcript model and divided this sum by the total number of these bases within that transcript to calculate read density. Both read depth and read density are presented in units of read depth per million bases acquired to obtain higher scale values. We focused our analysis on a set of 4,285 genes with known TSSs and termination sites (Nagalakshmi et al. 2008) and that do not overlap on the same strand. The reproducibility of the transcriptional activity and steady-state levels as determined from read densities in replicates of NRO and total RNA libraries was robust (Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s r2 > 0.97 and r2 > 0.99, respectively; Figure 1, B and C). Therefore, we merged reads from biological replicates to obtain a single NRO data set and a single total RNA data set for subsequent analyses. Of the 4,285 nonoverlapping transcript models, 2,717 and 2,802 genes were transcriptionally active in the NRO and total RNA libraries, respectively, as measured against the background from intergenic regions (P < 0.01; see the Materials and Methods). Our measurements of nascent transcription showed moderate correlation with previous genome-wide estimates of transcriptional activity derived from hybridization of radiolabeled nascent transcripts to nylon macroarrays (Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s \xcf\x81 = 0.53; Figure S1A). This correlation is comparable with that between previous measures of transcriptional activity obtained via the use of NRO approaches (Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s \xcf\x81 = 0.61; Figure S1B) (Garcia-Martinez et al. 2004; Pelechano et al. 2009). Excluding the rDNA cluster, we detected no large regions (>3 kb) in the yeast genome with extensive synthesis of nascent RNA (Z > 3.1; Figure S2). Because the NRO assay reflects the activity of RNA polymerases on transcribed genes, we compared the transcription data from the NRO sample to the genome-wide distribution of RNA polymerase II in yeast (Lefrancois et al. 2009), and found a low but significant correlation (Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s r2 = 0.41, P < 2.2 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9216; Figure S3A). The modest correlation between polymerase occupancy and transcriptional activity has been previously reported (Rodriguez-Gil et al. 2010) and might result from differences in the dynamic range of the protocols (as suggested by Rodriguez-Gil et al. 2010) or the inability of the NRO assay to precisely assign the positions of transcribing polymerases, because fragmentation of RNA was performed after its affinity selection. As expected, total RNA also correlated with polymerase occupancy, but to a lesser extent (Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s r2 = 0.37, P < 2.2 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9216; Figure S3B). This analysis corroborates that RNA polymerase occupancy is a better predictor of transcriptional activity than of transcript abundance. Although pre-mRNA splicing occurs co-transcriptionally in yeast, we observed greater intronic read depths in the NRO libraries than in the total RNA libraries (Figure S4A), and this increase was not caused by increased transcript levels. Moreover, splicing was much less abundant in the NRO libraries than in the total RNA libraries (Figure S4B), further arguing that the NRO libraries are enriched for nascent transcripts. Analysis of RNA polymerase II occupancy data from high-density tiling microarrays demonstrated that only highly expressed yeast genes (~16% of all genes) have an even distribution of RNA polymerase II throughout their coding region, and that a comparable fraction (~18%) have an enrichment of the polymerase near their 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends (Venters and Pugh 2009). This result and recent analysis of polymerase-associated RNAs suggests that transcription in yeast, as in metazoans, can be subject to rate-limiting regulatory steps in addition to polymerase recruitment and activation (Churchman and Weissman 2011). To analyze RNA polymerase II activity within genes, we examined read depth along a set of 2,530 transcript models of genes that were transcriptionally active in both the NRO and total RNA libraries. In contrast to the total RNA sample, the NRO sample showed an enrichment of reads near the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends of transcript models, with a read depth peak occurring approximately 50 bp downstream of the TSS (Figure 2A), as has been observed in human and Drosophila cells (Core et al. 2008; Rasmussen and Lis 1993). Sarkosyl treatment in the NRO assay allows RNA polymerases that are either transcribing or paused to incorporate nucleotides upon transcription reactivation (Rougvie and Lis 1990) but prevents further rounds of initiation (Hawley and Roeder 1985). Thus, the peak in read depth near TSSs (Figure 2A) likely indicates an accumulation of paused RNA polymerases at 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends. Because we carried out the enrichment of nascent RNA before its chemical fragmentation, all nascent transcripts detected in the NRO assay should have originated at their TSSs. This feature of the protocol results in nested sets of transcripts initiating at their 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end, with progressively fewer transcripts in each set containing bases further toward the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end, even for cases with relatively equal distribution of RNA polymerases along the gene. Indeed, we observe a gradual decrease in read depth beginning approximately 100 bp downstream from the TSS (Figure 2A; dashed line). The slope projects a read depth peak toward the TSS of 0.20 resulting from the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end being present in all the nascent transcripts. That the promoter proximal peak rises sharply near the TSS to a height more than 1.5-fold greater than the extrapolated value provides evidence for an enrichment of nascent transcripts, and hence RNA polymerase activity, near TSSs under NRO conditions. To assure that the observed promoter-proximal peak is a feature of yeast transcription, we performed additional analyses and ruled out the effect of nonspecific RNA binding (Figure S5), increased average read depth of shorter transcripts (Figure S6A), and sequencing biases (Figure S6B) as possible contributors to the increased read depth near 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends of yeast transcripts. Distribution of RNA polymerase activity relative to TSSs and termination sites. (A) The average sense read depth in the NRO (red) and total RNA (blue) libraries along 2,530 genes that are transcriptionally active in both libraries is plotted as a function of distance from TSSs. NRO libraries display a read depth peak within 100 bp 3\xe2\x80\xb2 from the TSS (highlighted in gray) with a peak maximum at approximately 50 bp downstream of their TSSs. Dashed line extends the slope of sequencing reads obtained along the transcript length (between 100-500 bp) toward the TSS to extrapolate read depth signal at the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends of transcripts. (B) Distribution of RNA polymerase activity relative to poly(A) sites in the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-end and 3\xe2\x80\xb2-end sequenced NRO libraries. The average sense read depth in the NRO (red) and total RNA (blue) libraries in transcriptionally active genes is plotted as a function of distance from poly(A) cleavage sites. A higher read depth near transcript termination sites is found for the total RNA libraries as compared to the NRO libraries. Inset: An additional strand-specific NRO library was sequenced from the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end to compare sense strand read depth information to that from 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end libraries. Sense read depth from 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end (light red) and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end (dark red) nascent RNA libraries is plotted as a function of distance from poly(A) sites for convergently transcribed genes (N = 2000). Near transcript termination sites, total RNA libraries show greater read depths than NRO libraries (Figure 2B), which is consistent with the fact that most nascent RNAs are not full length (Carrillo Oesterreich et al. 2010). Because our protocol acquires sense strand information from the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-most 36 bases of fragments, we were not able to detect a peak of nascent transcription near poly(A) sites, as was previously shown for human and yeast gene transcription (Carrillo Oesterreich et al. 2010; Core et al. 2008). To address this issue, we prepared a new NRO library from which we specifically sequenced the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end bases of transcripts and found a small peak of transcription consistent with poly(A) cleavage (Figure 2B; inset). In principle, the capacity to measure transcriptional activity for each base in the genome should allow us to distinguish rate-limiting steps in transcription other than transcription initiation. However, because read depth in high-throughput sequencing of RNA libraries is noisy (Ingolia et al. 2009), this goal is difficult. We sought to address this challenge by analyzing how reads accumulate along transcript models. Genes with a relatively homogenous distribution of active polymerases should display a linear increase in the cumulative fraction of reads along a transcript, whereas genes with polymerases predominantly near their 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends or near their 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends generate deflections from this line (Figure 3A). For a gene in which most reads are acquired near the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the transcript, the cumulative fraction curve climbs sharply to its maximum value and flattens. Thus, the AUC for the cumulative fraction of reads in genes with polymerase activity concentrated at the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end is larger than for those that are not paused or that accumulate reads at the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end. Identification of paused transcripts from nascent RNA libraries. (A) Graph depicts the expected accumulation of reads as a function of distance from TSS for transcripts enriched with polymerase at their 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end (green line) or 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end (blue line) or transcripts with homogenous RNA polymerase II activity (dashed line). (B) AUC ranking of genes. For each transcript model, the fraction of the total read depth acquired per position along the direction of transcription was computed. This fractional, cumulative read depth within transcript models was adjusted to a uniform model by redistributing values to reflect the read depth in the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-most 100 bp, 3\xe2\x80\xb2-most 100 bp, and the intervening sequence (marked with vertical dashed lines). Genes were ranked by the AUC of fractional, cumulative read depth in the uniform models. The fraction of the total read depth acquired for each transcript model is shown as a function of distance along the uniform model, where red represents 100%. Genes in the top 5% are highlighted within the black box and contain the histone loci. (C) IGV genome browser views (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv) of NRO read depth in the four divergently transcribed histone loci. With the exception of HTA2, core histones exhibit strong promoter-proximal pausing in NRO libraries. Normalized read depth is shown in the plus and minus strands as positive and negative values, respectively. Read depth range is indicated between brackets. Transcript models are schematized with green arrows indicating coding sequences. Mappable bases are marked green in the track underneath IGV views. To calculate the AUC for each gene, we first calculated the cumulative fraction of reads acquired at each position. We adjusted all transcript models to a uniform length, corresponding to the number of reads obtained for the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-most 100 bp, the 3\xe2\x80\xb2-most 100 bp, and the intervening sequence. We ranked genes by AUC to identify those with distinct distributions of RNA polymerase II activity along the length of their transcripts, which might correlate with distinct modes of transcriptional regulation (Figure 3B). AUC ranking of transcripts revealed that the top 5% of genes are enriched for nucleosome components (P = 7.15 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x925), chromatin assembly and disassembly genes (P = 0.001), helicases (P = 0.007), and ATPases (P = 0.008). Histone genes drive this enrichment because seven of the eight core histone genes demonstrated strong evidence of accumulation of polymerases at their 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends, which could reflect promoter-proximal pausing (Figure 3C). Given that transcription of histone genes is tightly limited in the cell cycle to early S phase, these data suggest that polymerase pausing could play a role in assuring rapid induction of histone synthesis just before the DNA synthesis (Hereford et al. 1981), consistent with the previous observation of paused RNA polymerase II on the Drosophila histone H3 gene (Li et al. 1996). Similarly, a Poisson-based test, as used in Core et al. 2008, characterized up to 20% of yeast transcripts as paused, suggesting that their expression may be subject to postinitiation transcriptional control (Figure S7). However, previous chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of yeast did not provide evidence for widespread polymerase pausing (Venters and Pugh 2009). The evidence of polymerase pausing from the NRO results may partially reflect the protocol used because fragmentation of RNA after affinity selection can make it difficult to precisely assign the position of polymerase. The AUC ranking allowed further identification of potential rate-limiting steps in transcription. This analysis identified not only genes that acquired the majority of their reads near their TSSs but also genes with low and middle AUC values. Genes with the lowest AUC values exhibited an accumulation of reads near their 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends, which may reflect regulation at the level of transcription termination (Figure S8). The middle range of the AUC-ranked list includes transcripts in which the cumulative fraction of reads increased linearly. In addition, the intermediate range includes transcripts with increased read densities in both the promoter-proximal region and near the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the transcript (Figure S8). Such transcripts could be targets of regulation at both promoter escape and transcriptional termination. Finally, transcripts in which nascent transcription is concentrated in the middle of the transcript are also found in this range. Although some of the patterns of read depth could be attributable to stochastic variations in fragment ligation, amplification or sequencing, the observation of transcriptional regulation occurring subsequent to initiation, pausing and release from pausing is consistent with recently observed patterns of RNA polymerase II activity derived from polymerase-associated RNAs (Churchman and Weissman 2011). Because recent genomic analyses have shown substantial antisense transcription in yeast (Nagalakshmi et al. 2008; Neil et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2009; Yassour et al. 2010), we asked whether we could detect the presence of antisense transcripts in the NRO and total RNA libraries. We found evidence of antisense transcription in 310 genes in the NRO libraries and in 135 genes in the total RNA libraries (Figure S9). The increased prevalence of antisense transcripts in the NRO sample likely relates to their instability and their consequent loss from the pool of total RNA. We asked whether bidirectional transcription from single promoters, as has been recently reported in yeast (Neil et al. 2009;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Xu et al. 2009), underlies the increased antisense transcription. We classified each promoter with respect to its upstream adjacent gene as either nondivergent (Figure 4A), in which the upstream gene is encoded on the same strand; or divergent (Figure 4B), in which the upstream gene is encoded on the opposite strand. We examined sense and antisense read depth in the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 flanking regions of the reference promoters (Figure 4, A and B, in blue) for the two configurations. For nondivergent promoters, very few antisense reads accumulated in the 200-bp 5\xe2\x80\xb2 to the TSSs of the reference promoters (Figure 4A), indicating that these promoters drive little antisense transcription. Similarly, for divergent promoters, very few antisense reads accumulated in the 100-bp 5\xe2\x80\xb2 to the TSSs (Figure 4B). The increasing antisense read depth beyond 100 bp reflects the activity of distinct promoters for the upstream genes, consistent with separate preinitiation complexes at divergently transcribed genes leading to a detectable signal (Venters and Pugh 2009). Bidirectional transcription from TSSs is not predominant in yeast. Sense (solid line) and antisense (dotted line) read depths are shown near the TSSs of reference genes (blue) with nondivergent (A) and divergent (B) promoters. Schematics indicate the orientations of transcripts upstream of reference genes with solid lines annotating sense and dotted lines antisense transcription. NRO and total RNA read depths are shown in red and blue, respectively. Read depth is classified as antisense and sense with respect to the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 reference gene in blue. In both types of promoters, NRO libraries display predominant sense transcription and a read depth peak approximately 50 bp downstream of their TSSs but do not show significant transcription in the antisense orientation. Having measured both transcriptional activity and steady-state levels of RNA, we sought to use the genome-wide data to explore the relationship between RNA synthesis, abundance, and stability. For this analysis, we chose to estimate transcriptional activity and steady-state RNA by calculating the read density excluding data within 200 bp of the TSS; in this way, we avoided analyzing transcripts that may have prematurely terminated. We compared the NRO-derived transcriptional activity with total RNA-derived steady-state levels and found a significant correlation (Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s r2 = 0.80), suggesting that this measure of transcriptional activity accounts for approximately 80% of the variance in transcript abundance (Figure 5). Contribution of transcript synthesis to transcript abundance and inference of transcript stability. Read density in the NRO and total RNA libraries is plotted for a set of 2,414 genes with significant transcription from 201 bp downstream of TSS. Transcript synthesis and transcript abundance, measured as read density within this region of transcripts in NRO and total RNA libraries, respectively, are strongly correlated. To estimate nascent transcript stability, we calculated the ratio of the transcript synthesis to transcript abundance for each gene. Genes in the top and bottom deciles of these ratios are circled in red and blue, respectively. To estimate the stability of nascent transcripts, we calculated the ratio of the transcriptional activity to the steady-state level for each gene. High ratios are consistent with short-lived transcripts, because much of their nascent RNA does not reach the steady-state pool. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that genes with the greatest ratios of transcriptional activity to steady state levels (Figure 5, in red) are enriched for transcripts involved in translational elongation (P = 7.0 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x926), drug transport (P = 5.1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x926), signal transduction (P = 1.0 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x924), and protein amino acid phosphorylation (P = 1.5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x924; Table S4). Short-lived transcripts are capable of rapid adjustments in abundance to assure quick responses to stimuli (Friedel et al. 2009; Grigull et al. 2004; Narsai et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2002). Conversely, genes with the lowest ratios of transcriptional activity to steady state levels (Figure 5, in blue) represent more stable nascent transcripts, and are enriched for structural constituents of the ribosome (P = 6.4 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x928) and genes involved in nucleosome assembly (P = 3.6 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x924; Table S5). Thus, our estimates of the stability of nascent transcripts agree with the expected stabilities of transcripts based on the functions of their encoded proteins, as observed previously (Friedel et al. 2009; Grigull et al. 2004; Narsai et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2002). The absolute half-lives of mRNAs have traditionally been measured over a time course after the inhibition of transcription by chemical or thermal inactivation of RNA polymerase II (Grigull et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2002). However, mRNA half-lives estimated by different groups by the use of similar types of experiments (Grigull et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2002) show little correlation (Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s r2 = 0.17; Figure S10A). We observed no correlation between the estimated stabilities of nascent transcripts in our study and previously measured mRNA decay rates (Grigull et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2002) (Figure S10, B and C). These discrepancies could at least in part be attributable to differences in the stability of nascent transcripts vs. that of mRNAs. In addition, the temperature shift to halt transcription might induce changes in RNA folding and thus affect estimates of mRNA half-lives. Finally, technical differences in the methodologies used may be contributing to these differences. For example, microarray measurements in of relative transcript abundance are subject to errors caused by differences in hybridization efficiencies. Similarly, sequencing biases introduce errors into our measurements of both transcriptional activity and steady-state levels of mRNAs and these errors may be compounded in the calculation of ratios. Several genome-wide studies have identified yeast genes that respond to temperature shock by elevating their transcript levels (Gasch et al. 2000; Hahn et al. 2004). We sought to examine the extent to which the effect of heat shock on transcript abundance occurs via the up-regulation of transcriptional activity. Thus, we built NRO libraries (\xe2\x80\x9cNRO [HS]\xe2\x80\x9d) and total RNA libraries (\xe2\x80\x9ctotal RNA [HS]\xe2\x80\x9d) from RNA isolated from six independent cultures of log phase yeast under heat shock conditions (20 min at 39\xc2\xb0; Table S6). To estimate the effect of heat shock on RNA abundance and transcription activity, we calculated the log-transformed ratios of read density values after and prior to heat shock for total RNA (total RNA [HS]/total RNA) and for nascent RNA (NRO [HS]/NRO). For total RNA, log-space ratios greater than zero represent transcripts with increased RNA abundance upon heat shock treatment, whereas those less than zero indicate decreased RNA abundance. For nascent RNA, log-space ratios greater than zero identify genes whose transcription was up-regulated upon heat shock, whereas those less than zero indicate those down-regulated (Figure 6). This analysis reveals that 304 (9%) yeast genes responded to heat stress by increasing RNA abundance by 2-fold or more (Table S7). Approximately 65% of those genes showed an increase in nascent RNA synthesis in response to heat shock, indicating that although transcript levels are predominantly regulated at the level of transcription, changes in mRNA stability play a role as well (Castells-Roca et al. 2011). We found that the majority (74%) of the genes induced at least 3-fold by heat shock in the study by Gasch et al. (2000) showed concordant increases in transcript abundance and in nascent RNA synthesis after heat shock, again highlighting the transcriptional activation that contributes to the increased RNA abundance for this class of genes. In addition, heat shock-inducible genes from the study by Gasch et al. 2000 showed a stronger correlation between changes in transcript abundance and changes in nascent transcript synthesis (Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s r2 = 0.55) compared with all yeast genes analyzed in this study (Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s r2 = 0.24). However, only 30 of the 304 genes with 2-fold or greater increased total RNA abundance after heat stress are known targets of Hsf1, a master transcriptional activator of the heat shock response, or contain Hsf1 or Msn2/4 recognition sites in their promoters (Table S7). Approximately 87% (26) of these 30 genes showed increased nascent transcript levels in response to heat shock. These findings suggest that additional factors may mediate stress-induced transcriptional activation. Transcript synthesis and abundance response to heat shock treatment. Ratios of read densities before and after heat shock are plotted for the NRO and total RNA libraries with all significantly expressed yeast genes shown in green and heat shock-responsive genes (\xe2\x89\xa53x increase in abundance upon heat shock treatment in Gasch et al. 2000 data set) shown in red. In this study, we provide a high-resolution view of genome-wide transcriptional regulation in S. cerevisiae. By coupling the NRO assay to high-throughput sequencing, we assayed the synthesis of nascent RNA in yeast under normal growth conditions and in response to heat stress. We measured RNA abundance and synthesis in parallel, which revealed that cellular RNA abundance in yeast under both growth conditions is predominantly controlled by the rate of RNA synthesis. In accord with previous degradation experiments, we observed distinct functional gene classes between stable and unstable transcripts (Friedel et al. 2009; Grigull et al. 2004; Narsai et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2002). These data allowed us to examine the spatial distribution of RNA synthesis along transcripts, which showed that nascent transcription in yeast is enriched near TSSs, as it is in humans. The data further suggest that postinitiation regulation in yeast may contribute to the control of gene expression (Churchman and Weissman 2011). Although recruitment of RNA polymerase to promoters appears to be rate-limiting for the large majority of yeast genes, transcription of up to 20% of yeast genes may be controlled at least in part at postinitiation steps. The mechanisms that determine polymerase pausing, arrest, or termination are not yet well understood. Many factors that modulate transcriptional pausing and the rate of elongation have been identified (Sims et al. 2004). Some of them are restricted to a subset of eukaryotes, with no homologs identified in yeast. However, in a recent study, Rodriguez-Gil et al. (2010) identified a subset of elongation-related factors (e.g. DSIF, Mediator, and the RNA polymerase II subunit Rpb9) that might influence the probability of RNA polymerase II pausing or arrest in yeast. In addition, the elongation factor TFIIS (yeast Dst1) stimulates intrinsic RNA polymerase RNA cleavage activity and thus promotes elongation of arrested RNA polymerase in vivo (Churchman and Weissman 2011). Signals in the DNA or RNA may affect RNA elongation; for example, both a hairpin structure in the nascent RNA and a run of uridines at the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of a transcript interfere with elongation and promote transcription termination (Bengal and Aloni 1989; Keene et al. 1999; Palangat et al. 1998). The authors of recent studies have identified numerous cryptic unstable transcripts in yeast (Neil et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2009). Most of these transcripts were suggested to be byproducts of bidirectional transcription that originated from the same promoter but from distinct pre-initiation complexes (Neil et al. 2009). We observed little bidirectional transcription in either the NRO or total RNA samples. However, detection of cryptic unstable transcripts relied on the use of a strain defective in the nuclear exosome machinery (Neil et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2009). Thus, it is possible that most of the antisense transcription was undetectable in the strain used in our study, which is competent for RNA turnover. For nondivergent promoters, with an average intergenic distance of approximately 342 bp (Dujon 1996), a weak antisense signal arises at approximately \xe2\x88\x92200 bp from the TSS, much upstream of the core promoter. Similarly, for divergent promoters, the antisense signal does not begin to accumulate until approximately \xe2\x88\x92150 bp from the TSS. The distances at which antisense transcription is originated suggest that it likely results from the activity of a separate transcription pre-initiation complex assembled at a different core promoter. An important biological question is how cells respond and cope with rapid changes in their environment, such as exposure to elevated temperatures (heat shock). Several genome-wide studies revealed that this response involves an increase in the abundance of transcripts from genes that are collectively termed \xe2\x80\x9cheat shock-inducible\xe2\x80\x9d (Gasch et al. 2000; Hahn et al. 2004). Earlier studies of the Drosophila hsp70 gene found that posttranscriptional regulation that affects RNA stability plays a role in the observed increase of hsp70 RNA levels in response to heat shock (Theodorakis and Morimoto 1987). Other studies of heat shock-inducible genes in Drosophila and humans found rapid transcriptional activation after heat shock, suggesting that this activation also contributes to increased RNA levels of heat shock-inducible genes (Mathur et al. 1994; O\xe2\x80\x99Brien and Lis 1993). However, in previous studies investigators have not assessed global changes in nascent transcription in response to heat shock. Here, we found that both transcriptional activation and RNA stabilization likely play a role in the increased abundance of RNAs after heat shock treatment. Most of the heat shock-inducible genes (~74%) showed both an increase in nascent transcription and an increase in RNA abundance. Only approximately 14% of these genes increased their RNA abundance without increasing nascent transcription, indicative of RNA stabilization as the mechanism. In summary, we used the NRO assay to provide a high-resolution view of transcriptional regulation in yeast. We applied this assay to examine the correlation between synthesis and abundance of transcripts, the distribution of polymerase activity along transcripts, and the genome-wide changes in yeast transcription in response to heat shock treatment. Further investigations may use similar approaches to characterize other modes of yeast transcriptional control under different growth conditions and in response to other environmental perturbations.

Eukaryotic ncRNAs are commonly micro- and small-interfering RNAs (18\xe2\x80\x9325 nt) involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing, whereas prokaryotic ncRNAs vary in size and are involved in various aspects of gene regulation. Given the prokaryotic origin of organelles, the presence of ncRNAs might be expected; however, the full spectrum of organellar ncRNAs has not been determined systematically. Here, strand-specific RNA-Seq analysis was used to identify 107 candidate ncRNAs from Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts, primarily encoded opposite protein-coding and tRNA genes. Forty-eight ncRNAs were shown to accumulate by RNA gel blot as discrete transcripts in wild-type (WT) plants and/or the pnp1-1 mutant, which lacks the chloroplast ribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (cpPNPase). Ninety-eight percent of the ncRNAs detected by RNA gel blot had different transcript patterns between WT and pnp1-1, suggesting cpPNPase has a significant role in chloroplast ncRNA biogenesis and accumulation. Analysis of materials deficient for other major chloroplast ribonucleases, RNase R, RNase E, and RNase J, showed differential effects on ncRNA accumulation and/or form, suggesting specificity in RNase-ncRNA interactions. 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end mapping demonstrates that some ncRNAs are transcribed from dedicated promoters, whereas others result from transcriptional read-through. Finally, correlations between accumulation of some ncRNAs and the symmetrically transcribed sense RNA are consistent with a role in RNA stability. Overall, our data suggest that this extensive population of ncRNAs has the potential to underpin a previously underappreciated regulatory mode in the chloroplast.Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes express a large number of noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) antisense to coding regions, ranging from \xe2\x88\xbc9% (Arabidopsis) to 29% (mouse) of identified genes (Jen et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2006). Although the term ncRNA refers to abundant transcripts, such as rRNAs and tRNAs, it has more recently incorporated regulatory RNAs, such as bacterial small RNAs (sRNA; <400 nt), eukaryotic micro- and small-interfering RNAs (miRNA and siRNA), antisense RNAs (asRNA) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA). The present study focuses on asRNAs, which can be divided into two groups based on the target interaction: cis-encoded asRNAs bind to and regulate the complementary sense RNA, and trans-encoded asRNAs act on one or more unlinked loci through short regions of complementarity. Base pairing of these asRNAs to their targets can elicit translational inactivation/activation, mRNA stabilization/destabilization, or differential transcription termination (Storz et al. 2005; Repoila and Darfeuille 2009). The occurrence of plant organellar ncRNAs has been established by limited analysis of specific cDNA populations. Studies have revealed mitochondrial ncRNAs from wild-type (WT) and mitochondrial polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase)\xe2\x80\x93deficient Arabidopsis (Holec et al. 2006; Lung et al. 2006) and short (<500 nt) ncRNAs from tobacco and Arabidopsis chloroplasts (Marker et al. 2002; Lung et al. 2006). Subsequent studies have attempted to elucidate the regulatory roles of chloroplast ncRNAs. In one case, an ndhB asRNA was hypothesized to stabilize or regulate maturation of the cognate sense transcript, whereas a psbT asRNA was proposed to regulate accumulation of PsbT protein through occlusion of the psbT ribosomal binding site (Georg et al. 2010; Zghidi-Abouzid et al. 2011). Our own work suggested a role for an asRNA complementary to the 5S rRNA, AS5, in regulating the processing and accumulation of 5S rRNA (Hotto et al. 2010; Sharwood et al. 2011). There are at least two indications that the organellar ncRNA population might be significantly more complex than elucidated to date. First, in cyanobacteria, which represent the chloroplast progenitor, numerous ncRNAs have been identified, some of which accumulate differentially in response to stress or developmental stage (Steglich et al. 2008; Georg et al. 2009). Second, transcription termination in chloroplasts has long been known to be inefficient (Stern and Gruissem 1987), suggesting that intergenic and antisense regions may be readily transcribed. Taken together, it is clear that ncRNAs accumulate in chloroplasts, and available evidence favors functional roles in gene expression, at least for some. To gain a more complete picture of this population, we have used strand-specific, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of total RNA. We present data extracted from this sequencing, demonstrating that accumulating ncRNAs are derived from much of the chloroplast genome.

The biogenesis and regulation of these RNAs are further examined through analysis of chloroplast ribonuclease mutants and 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end mapping. Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col-0) was used as the WT for this study. The three T-DNA mutants used contain insertions in the genes At3g03710 (pnp1-1; SALK_013306), At5g02250 (rnr1-3; SALK_090294), and At2g04270 (rne1-1; SALK_093546) and have been previously characterized (Alonso et al. 2003; Bollenbach et al. 2005; Mudd et al. 2008; Marchive et al. 2009). WT and pnp1-1 plants were germinated and grown on soil with a 16-h light/dark photoperiod (150 \xce\xbcmol m-2 s-1 intensity). The rnr1-3, rne1-1, and WT seeds were surface sterilized and germinated on MS-agar medium under 100 \xce\xbcmol m-2 s-1 light with a 16-h light/dark photoperiod. At 25 days postgermination, rne1-1 plants and the WT control were transferred to soil and grown under 150 \xce\xbcmol m-2 s-1 light. All plants were grown at 25\xc2\xb0. Leaf tissue was harvested after 40 days from rne1-1, rnr1-3, and WT and after 25 days for soil-grown pnp1-1 and WT, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \xe2\x88\x9280\xc2\xb0 for subsequent analysis. RNase J\xe2\x80\x93deficient material was produced using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) as previously described (Sharwood et al. 2011). Affected tissue and empty vector control samples were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \xe2\x88\x9280\xc2\xb0. Plants deficient for the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) were generated by germination on MS-agar medium containing 500 \xce\xbcg mL-1 spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) (Swiatecka-Hagenbruch et al. 2007). After stratification, plants were placed under an 8-h light/dark photoperiod for 14 days, then transferred to a 16-h light/dark photoperiod for an additional 7 days (150 \xce\xbcmol m-2 s-1 light intensity) prior to harvest. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) from two WT and two pnp1-1 samples. Ten micrograms total RNA were depleted of rRNAs using the plant RiboMinus-Kit (Invitrogen). Strand-specific RNA-Seq libraries were prepared following the \xe2\x80\x9cDirectional mRNA-Seq Library Prep Pre-Release\xe2\x80\x9d protocol by Illumina. Each sample was sequenced for 85 cycles on an Illumina GAIIx. Image analysis and base calling were performed with the standard Illumina pipeline (Firecrest v1.3.4 and Bustard v.1.3.4). The resulting reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR9) using Tophat (version 1.0.13)/Bowtie (version 0.12.3) with the following commands: -F 0 -g 2 -I 5000 (Langmead et al. 2009; Trapnell et al. 2010). Up to two locations were accepted for placement of sequenced reads to allow mapping to the large inverted repeat of the chloroplast genome. Sequence data can be downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive SRA046998. Mature leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA extracted using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) with minor modifications to the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. RNA was precipitated overnight with isopropanol at \xe2\x88\x9220\xc2\xb0, and the pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and dissolved in water. Primers were designed for cDNA synthesis, PCR, and RNA blot probe synthesis to amplify a \xe2\x89\xa4100 nt ncRNA section as determined from the RNA-Seq data using Primer3 (Rozen and Skaletsky 2000). For strand-specific cDNA synthesis, 1 \xce\xbcg of DNase-treated RNA (Promega) was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript III (Invitrogen) using 2 \xce\xbcM of the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ncRNA gene-specific primers (supporting information, Table S1). The PCR reaction contained 1X Master Mix, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 400 nM each 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 primer, 1.25 U GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega), and 100 ng of cDNA in a 25 \xce\xbcL reaction volume. Amplification was completed with the following protocol: initial denaturation at 94\xc2\xb0 for 3 min, then 30 cycles at 94\xc2\xb0 for 30 s, 60\xc2\xb0 for 30 s, and 72\xc2\xb0 for 30 s, and a final extension of 72\xc2\xb0 for 7 min. Amplicons were visualized after migration in 2% agarose gels. For RNA gel blot analysis, 5 \xce\xbcg of total RNA was separated in 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels, which were blotted overnight onto Hybond-N+ (GE Healthcare) in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer. Membranes were probed with single-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA probes as indicated in the figure legends. The ncRNA templates for probe synthesis were amplified with the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 primer and the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 primer containing a T7 promoter, and the sense strand templates for probe synthesis were amplified with the corresponding ncRNA 3\xe2\x80\xb2 primer and 5\xe2\x80\xb2 primer containing a T7 promoter. The only exception was the sense strand tRNA template, which was amplified with tRNA-specific primers given in Table S1. RNA probes were made from 100 ng of template using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) and 40 \xce\xbcCi \xce\xb1-32P-UTP, and purification through a Sephadex G-25 column. Membrane hybridization and washing were performed as previously described (Hotto et al. 2010). Where indicated in Figure 4, dsDNA probes synthesized from 100 ng of template were used, with hybridization according to Church and Gilbert (1984). 5\xe2\x80\xb2 RACE used the GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen) with minor modifications. DNase-treated (Ambion) total RNA (4 \xce\xbcg) was incubated with and without tobacco acid phosphatase (TAP), followed by ligation to the GeneRacer RNA Oligo with T4 RNA ligase (treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase was omitted). The ncRNA cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III using 3\xe2\x80\xb2 gene-specific primers (Table S1). The 5\xe2\x80\xb2 cDNA ends were amplified by PCR using 0.02 U \xce\xbcL-1 Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific), 0.9 \xce\xbcM GeneRacer 5\xe2\x80\xb2 primer, 0.3 \xce\xbcM 3\xe2\x80\xb2 gene-specific primer, 1X Phusion HF buffer, 300 nM each dNTP, and 8 ng of cDNA in a 50 \xce\xbcL reaction volume. The following cycling protocol was used: initial denaturation at 98\xc2\xb0 for 30 s, then 35 cycles at 98\xc2\xb0 for 10 s, 64\xc2\xb0 for 20 s, and 72\xc2\xb0 for 60 s, and a final extension at 72\xc2\xb0 for 5 min. Nested PCR was performed using 1 \xce\xbcl of the initial PCR as a template with 0.2 \xce\xbcM each 3\xe2\x80\xb2 nested primer and GeneRacer 5\xe2\x80\xb2 nested primer, 200 nM each dNTP, and either 1X Phusion HF buffer with 0.02 U \xce\xbcL-1 Phusion DNA polymerase or 1X GoTaq buffer with 1.25 U GoTaq DNA polymerase in a 50 \xce\xbcL reaction volume. The cycling protocol used for nested PCR with Phusion polymerase was the same as above, except the annealing temperature was 65\xc2\xb0. The cycling protocol for nested PCR with GoTaq polymerase was as follows: initial denaturation at 94\xc2\xb0 for 3 min, then 35 cycles at 94\xc2\xb0 for 30 s, 60\xc2\xb0 for 30 s, and 72\xc2\xb0 for 90 s, and a final extension at 72\xc2\xb0 for 5 min. 5\xe2\x80\xb2 RACE products were visualized in 1% agarose gels. Specific bands were gel extracted using the Wizard SV Gel Clean-up System (Promega) and either directly sequenced or cloned into pCR 4-TOPO and then sequenced. Sequences were aligned to the Arabidopsis chloroplast genome (accession number NC_000932). Total RNA isolated from mature leaves of Arabidopsis WT and the chloroplast PNPase (cpPNPase) null mutant pnp1-1 was sequenced to identify potential nc- and asRNAs. We examined pnp1-1 because PNPase has an active role in bacterial ncRNA regulation, and Arabidopsis mitochondrial ncRNAs overaccumulate in plants deficient for the mitochondrial isozyme (Holec et al. 2006; Viegas et al. 2007; Bollenbach et al. 2008). To achieve strand-specific sequencing of the chloroplast transcriptome, 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 oligonucleotides were sequentially added to total RNA after depletion of rRNA and metal hydrolysis, a method that retains transcripts longer than approximately 80 nt. The Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx platform was used to sequence this pool, resulting in a strand-specific RNA-Seq dataset. Sequences that aligned to the chloroplast genome were extracted, resulting in an average of 10,545,033 reads per sample and coverage of greater than 99% of both strands of the WT chloroplast genome, including unannotated regions. For this study, we focused on identification of putative asRNAs with at least partial complementarity to a known sense transcript and identification of ncRNAs that are complementary to intergenic regions within known gene clusters, thus excluding possible ncRNAs derived from cleavage of known functional transcripts. To limit identification of false positives, a minimum of 50\xc3\x97 coverage at any nucleotide in the WT and/or pnp1-1 was defined as a transcription peak corresponding to an ncRNA candidate. One challenge was identifying the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends of novel transcripts, particularly those of low abundance. Since RNA-Seq relies on ligation of oligonucleotides to the RNA ends, those ends engaged in secondary structures will be underrepresented, resulting in an uneven distribution of reads across contiguous transcripts and low coverage of ends (Wang et al. 2009; Roberts et al. 2011). For the purpose of this study, an end was assigned when the sequencing coverage fell below 10\xc3\x97. As an example of the application of these criteria, Figure 1A shows two candidate asRNAs, as-psbK and as-psbI, and Figure 1B shows four potential asRNAs, as-ndhD1\xe2\x80\x934. In these cases, the occurrence of an asRNA candidate was prompted when the depth of coverage exceeded 50\xc3\x97 at a single nucleotide, and it was assumed to continue in both directions until the coverage dropped below 10\xc3\x97. In Figure 1A, this resulted in the identification of two asRNAs in this region with a gap between them, as annotated in Table 1. Under such circumstances, however, two peaks might actually correspond to a single ncRNA with poor sequence coverage in the intervening region, as shown by the continuous dashed red line. The ndhD situation was more complex, given that the four individual asRNA peaks might represent as few as one, or as many as four, actual ncRNA species. This type of ambiguity arose rather frequently, with the extreme example being the 10 transcripts defined as antisense to ycf2.1. The same phenomenon was also seen when sense strand transcripts were examined (insets in Figure 1). Therefore, the fragmentation of transcripts appears to be a limitation to the RNA-Seq method, rather than a peculiarity of ncRNAs themselves. Identification of Arabidopsis chloroplast ncRNAs from RNA-Seq data. Graphs represent the depth of coverage of ncRNA vs. genome position from 6688\xe2\x80\x937872 bp (A) or 115447\xe2\x80\x93117318 bp (B). The insets contain both sense (black/gray) and antisense (red/pink) reads. Below each graph is the gene model for the area, including known genes (black arrows) and potential ncRNAs (dashed red arrows). Vertical dashed lines correspond to potential 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends of ncRNAs, based on the RNA-Seq peaks in WT. The solid horizontal lines delineate the thresholds of 10 and 50 reads, as discussed in the text. When the RNA-Seq datasets from both genotypes were analyzed using these criteria, 107 ncRNA candidates were identified (Table 1), ranging in size from 48 to 1,300 nt, with an average size of 217 nt. Of this pool, 12 candidates were defined strictly as ncRNAs because they were complementary to intergenic regions within operons, whereas the remaining 95 candidates were asRNAs as they were antisense to known coding regions. Of the 107 candidates, 29 exceeded the 50\xc3\x97 coverage only in pnp1-1, although most were also visible as peaks in the WT reads (e.g. as-psbI and as-ndhD1; Figure 1). Additionally, both sense and antisense transcript abundances were estimated by binning reads according to their start position against the TAIR9 genome annotation. Overall, asRNAs contained \xe2\x88\xbc4-fold more sequencing reads in pnp1-1 compared with the WT (Figure 1 and Table S2). This observation explains, at least in part, why some candidates were identified from the mutant. It also suggests that, as in Arabidopsis mitochondria (Holec et al. 2006), cpPNPase may globally modulate ncRNA abundance. The 95 asRNA candidates mentioned above can be classified by the function of the complementary strand. As shown in Figure 2, the distribution of sense strand gene function was broad, with the largest group being miscellaneous protein-coding genes. These include several ycf (hypothetical coding frame) genes, which are genes of unknown function that are conserved between species. However, all gene classes were well represented except rRNAs. In total, more than half of the annotated chloroplast genes had one or more predicted asRNA counterparts. Putative locations of sense-antisense RNA pairing can also be used to predict function, including 5\xe2\x80\xb2 (\xe2\x88\xbc31 asRNAs) and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end pairing (\xe2\x88\xbc39 asRNAs), and pairing within the coding region (\xe2\x88\xbc40 asRNAs; see Discussion). Overall, this suggests a variety of possible regulatory functions and targets. The proportion of ncRNAs antisense to sense strand coding region categories, as discussed in the text. PS, photosynthetic. To explore whether the ncRNAs identified using RNA-Seq were discrete species, expression was first tested by RT-PCR. PCR primers were designed to amplify a \xe2\x89\xa4100 nt transcript segment toward the middle of the expression peak defined by RNA-Seq. Of the 107 ncRNA candidates, 77 were tested, and of these, 69 were detected by RT-PCR in the WT (Table 1). For the 8 that were negative, the most likely explanation is low transcript abundance; however, we did not repeat the analysis using alternative primer sets or RNA from pnp1-1. Each of the 69 ncRNAs confirmed by RT-PCR was analyzed by RNA gel blot using WT and pnp1-1 samples. Of these, 48 ncRNAs gave visible signals for the WT, pnp1-1, or both; however, the number, size, or abundance of transcripts often differed between WT and pnp1-1 (Figure 3A and Figure S1). Transcript sizes ranged from \xe2\x88\xbc100 nt in WT and \xe2\x88\xbc200 nt in pnp1-1 to >3 kb in both. In all but five cases, the transcript size was underestimated by the RNA-Seq data for all transcripts observable by RNA blot in both WT and pnp1-1. In one case, RNA-Seq overestimated the transcript size (as-ycf2.1-5, detected in WT only; Figure S1); in two cases, there was a transcript of approximately the predicted size in WT (as-ycf9, as-trnR.1); and in two cases, the transcript was smaller than the predicted transcript in WT (as-trnfM, nc-trnL-ndhBint). Analysis of 10 genic areas for nc- and sense RNAs. (A) RNA gel blot detection of ncRNAs (top) and the corresponding sense strand (bottom). Five micrograms of total RNA from wild-type (W) and pnp1-1 (P) samples was separated in a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, blotted, and incubated with strand-specific probes. An ethidium bromide (EtBr)\xe2\x80\x93stained gel is shown with rRNA sizes (kb; left). The 28S rRNA ethidium bromide\xe2\x80\x93stained gel is shown below each blot to reflect loading. (B) Representative gene models for the nc- (red dashed arrows) and sense (filled black arrows) RNAs from (A). Solid black lines under the red arrows represent probes used for RNA blot analysis and amplicons for RT-PCR verification. Gene models are drawn to the scales shown at right. The representative examples in Figure 3A show that transcript abundance, as estimated by hybridization signal intensity, ranged from low (e.g. as-psbB) to high (e.g. as-psbK and as-ndhF-5\xe2\x80\xb2-2). Additionally, the transcript patterns varied from simple (e.g. as-psbK and as-ndhD-2) to more complex (e.g. as-ycf1.2-4), suggestive of varying biogenesis pathways. Additional examples are shown in Figure S1. For the 21 ncRNAs not detected by gel blot (Table 1), we presume that they are of even lower abundance than species such as as-psbB. The differences in ncRNA patterns between the WT and pnp1-1 were in some instances quite dramatic. For example, some ncRNAs were only detectable in the pnp1-1 sample (e.g. as-rps16i-1 and as-psbB), although they were originally verified by RT-PCR from WT. This suggests that their abundance is normally strongly limited by cpPNPase activity and that, in effect, pnp1-1 is an overexpressor of these species, a finding consistent with RNA-Seq data (Table S2). In other cases, such as nc-rbcL-accD and as-ycf1.2-4, there were additional, shorter transcripts in pnp1-1. These could be degradation intermediates that persist in the absence of cpPNPase activity. Many ncRNAs were slightly longer in pnp1-1 compared with the WT (e.g. as-trnQ and as-psbK). Because of the known functions of cpPNPase, the longer transcripts presumably include 3\xe2\x80\xb2 extensions. Taken together, these data point to cpPNPase as a key player for ncRNA processing and accumulation. Because ncRNA transcript abundance and form differed between WT and pnp1-1, we decided to examine the corresponding sense strand transcripts for possible correlations between sense-antisense pairs for the 10 examples shown in Figure 3. In 7 of these 10 cases, the genotypes varied in ncRNA abundance and/or transcript number. In other cases, pnp1-1 ncRNAs appeared to have 3\xe2\x80\xb2 extensions but similar accumulation. To facilitate the comparison, single-stranded probes for the sense and antisense strands were created from identical regions of the genome, except for tRNAs where the complete tRNA sequence was used regardless of the antisense probe location. The three tRNA probes revealed an estimated 2- to 3-fold increased tRNA abundance in pnp1-1 compared with the WT. This result is consistent with an earlier report implicating cpPNPase in the regulation of tRNAs (Walter et al. 2002). Interestingly, the abundance of the corresponding antisense tRNAs increased in pnp1-1 at least slightly (trnQ) or markedly (trnT.1 and trnS.3). In addition to tRNA regulation, cpPNPase has been implicated in the degradation of group II introns following splicing (Germain et al. 2011). We observed here that the rps16 intron overaccumulates in pnp1-1 as multiple larger transcripts and a single smaller transcript, in addition to the WT transcripts. The increase in rps16 intron abundance correlated with an increase in abundance of as-rps16i-1, which is barely detectable in the WT. An analogous positive correlation was observed for psbB. An opposite phenomenon was observed for nc-rbcL-accDint and the corresponding sense strand intergenic region. In this case, a smaller and less abundant ncRNA correlated with accumulation of the complementary region, which does not accumulate in the WT. Another inverse correlation was observed for the ndhF 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end. Although these correlations are intriguing, and a causal relationship would be consistent with known functions of ncRNAs in prokaryotes, the behaviors of complementary transcripts could also be independent effects of cpPNPase depletion. Additional experimentation will be required to make this determination. Chloroplast genes can be transcribed from their own promoter and/or cotranscribed with an upstream gene by either a nuclear-encoded phage-like RNA polymerase (NEP) or the bacterial-like PEP (Liere and Borner 2008). PEP-regulated genes often encode proteins involved in photosynthesis, whereas many NEP-regulated genes maintain gene expression functions. Additionally, PEP- and NEP-regulated genes are expressed differentially throughout plastid development (Liere and Maliga 2001). We elected to examine several ncRNAs from this viewpoint to begin to define ncRNA biogenesis pathways in the chloroplast. Transcription by PEP vs. NEP was determined by germinating plants on media with and without spectinomycin. Spectinomycin inhibits plastid translation and, therefore, PEP synthesis, creating chlorophyll-deficient plants with only NEP activity (Swiatecka-Hagenbruch et al. 2007). Confirmation of PEP inhibition can be seen from the ethidium bromide\xe2\x80\x93stained gel in which the plastid rRNAs are greatly reduced or absent (Figure 4A, left panel). Analysis of these samples by RNA gel blot revealed as-psbK and as-ndhD-2 to be PEP dependent, whereas as-accD is transcribed by NEP. For the two PEP-dependent ncRNAs, upstream genes on the same strand could give rise to the ncRNAs by read-through transcription. We found, however, that trnS.1 is PEP independent, unlike the downstream ncRNA. On the other hand, ycf5 and as-ndhD-2 were both PEP dependent, consistent with a cotranscription model. Promoter analysis of three ncRNAs. (A) RNA blots of ncRNAs from wild-type (WT) and pnp1-1 RNA from plants grown with (+) and without (\xe2\x88\x92) spectinomycin (spec). Probes are indicated below each panel, and an ethidium bromide (EtBr)\xe2\x80\x93stained gel is shown with rRNA sizes (nt; left). The trnS.1 and ycf5 sense RNAs were hybridized with a double-stranded DNA probe. (B) Confirmed ncRNA gene models showing the major 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends from processed (red arrows) and primary (dark red arrow) transcripts mapped using RACE +/\xe2\x88\x92 TAP treatment. A putative promoter (bent arrow) is shown for as-accD. To ascertain whether these ncRNAs have dedicated promoters, their 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends were mapped using 5\xe2\x80\xb2 RACE with or without prior treatment by tobacco acid phosphatase (TAP; Figure S2). Chloroplast primary transcripts are triphosphorylated and amenable to RNA ligase\xe2\x80\x93mediated oligonucleotide addition only after TAP treatment removes the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 diphosphate (Bensing et al. 1996). Conversely, processed transcripts do not require TAP treatment for oligonucleotide adaptation. RACE analysis revealed two 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends for as-psbK, as diagrammed in Figure 4B, that are not TAP dependent. The longer transcript has its 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end precisely at the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the upstream trnS.1 coding region (Figure S2, band a), which suggests that the asRNA 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end is derived from 3\xe2\x80\xb2 processing of a tRNA precursor. The second, shorter as-psbK transcript (Figure S2, band b), with its end between psbK and psbI, is likely a processing product of the larger species. Analysis of as-accD revealed three 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends, the longest of which was TAP dependent (Figure S2, band c), indicating that it is a primary transcript. The region upstream of as-accD is AT-rich and includes a putative type-1a YRTA NEP consensus motif (TATA) at -8, consistent with expression on spectinomycin media (Hajdukiewicz et al. 1997; Swiatecka-Hagenbruch et al. 2007). Given that there is no immediate upstream gene transcribed in the same direction, the presence of an ncRNA-specific promoter was not unexpected. Lastly, three as-ndhD-2 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends were mapped, none of which were TAP dependent (Figure S2, bands f\xe2\x80\x93h), consistent with the cotranscription model proposed above. The longest transcript extended just past the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the complementary ndhD gene, whereas the other two 5\xe2\x80\xb2 ends were internal to the ndhD coding region. In bacteria, the ribonucleases PNPase, RNase E, and RNase III have been shown to regulate ncRNA stability (Viegas et al. 2007; Andrade and Arraiano 2008; Stead et al. 2010). Therefore, we examined the roles of chloroplast ribonucleases in ncRNA accumulation and biogenesis (Figure 5). These were chloroplast PNPase, RNase R, a 3\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x86\x925\xe2\x80\xb2 hydrolytic exoribonuclease; RNase E, an endoribonuclease; and RNase J, whose known activities in bacteria include 5\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x80\xb2 exoribonuclease and endoribonuclease (Deikus et al. 2008). Published studies for chloroplasts have implicated RNase R in rRNA maturation (Bollenbach et al. 2005) and regulation of the asRNA AS5 (Sharwood et al. 2011), and RNase E in polycistronic RNA cleavage (Walter et al. 2010). Although null mutants for RNase R and RNase E are viable, RNase J deficiency is embryo-lethal, so we used tissue partly depleted for the enzyme by VIGS (Sharwood et al. 2011). Analysis of three ncRNAs (top panel) and the complementary transcripts (lower panel) in chloroplast ribonuclease-deficient samples. The 28S rRNA was ethidium bromide stained to reflect loading (bottom). Null mutants for PNPase (pnp1-1), RNase R (rnr1-3), and RNase E (rne1-1), and VIGS knockdown tissue for RNase J [RNJ(\xe2\x88\x92)] were used. Blots were analyzed as described in Figure 3. The as-psbK blot was reprobed to detect the sense transcript (the as-psbK species is marked \xe2\x80\x9cas\xe2\x80\x9d in both panels). An as-ndhF5\xe2\x80\xb2-2 precursor that accumulates in rne1-1 is marked by an asterisk. The left column of Figure 5 shows analysis of as-psbK and psbK. In the absence of RNase R, neither as-psbK nor psbK was detected, and in the absence of RNase E, both transcripts underaccumulated. Thus, there is a positive correlation between psbK and as-psbK accumulation. One possibility is that RNase R and RNase E are part of a maturation pathway for psbK and/or as-psbK, and in their absence, misprocessed transcripts may be readily degraded. The center column of Figure 5 shows nc-rbcL-accDint and the corresponding sense intergenic region. We found that nc-rbcL-accDint underaccumulates in pnp1-1, as shown in Figure 3, and in rne1-1. In both cases, underaccumulation of the ncRNA correlated with accumulation of the sense strand. As rbcL and accD are transcribed from individual PEP and NEP promoters, respectively, the intergenic region detected is likely an extension of an rbcL precursor rather than an unprocessed dicistron (Gruissem and Zurawski 1985; Hirata et al. 2004). PNPase and RNase E appear to have a role in rbcL maturation that leads to degradation of the intergenic region, as this transcript is not detectable in the WT. We also noted a larger form of nc-rbcL-accDint in rnr1-3 and RNJ(\xe2\x88\x92), implying that these ribonucleases are partially involved in the biogenesis of this ncRNA. Finally, we analyzed the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the ndhF gene (Figure 5, right column). The asRNA was present as a doublet in WT, which was slightly longer in pnp1-1, likely due to a 3\xe2\x80\xb2 extension. In rne1-1, a much longer form was detected (asterisk) and the lower doublet band was absent. This lower band was also absent from rnr1-3. In RNJ(\xe2\x88\x92), however, as-ndhF-5\xe2\x80\xb2-2 accumulated in the same forms as in the WT, although the abundance was increased. Together these results indicate that this asRNA undergoes posttranscriptional processing to the mature forms found in the WT. Aberrant as-ndhF-5\xe2\x80\xb2-2 processing coincided with altered ndhF sense transcript processing and abundance. In the WT, ndhF accumulated as a single transcript, whereas in pnp1-1, this transcript was apparent, along with three smaller transcripts. The sense transcript was reduced in both rnr1-3 and rne1-1, whereas it overaccumulated in RNJ(\xe2\x88\x92). It remains to be determined whether the correlations between the sense and antisense transcripts are due to direct interactions. However, the data presented reveal roles for many enzymes in determining the accumulation and form of chloroplast ncRNAs, which likely reflects a variety of biogenesis pathways. Knowledge of the extent and function of ncRNAs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes has grown considerably over the last 20 years, fueled by advances in sequencing technology and bioinformatics. However, information on the occurrence of ncRNAs in organelles, specifically the chloroplast, has been limited in scope and depth (Marker et al. 2002; Lung et al. 2006; Georg et al. 2010; Hotto et al. 2010; Mohorianu et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2011; Zghidi-Abouzid et al. 2011).

ployed high-throughput, strand-specific RNA sequencing (Lister et al. 2008) to identify the bulk of stably expressed Arabidopsis chloroplast ncRNAs >100 nt in length. These ncRNAs are transcribed by at least two RNA polymerase types, and their accumulation is affected by a variety of chloroplast ribonucleases. It is likely that some proportion of them plays a role in chloroplast gene expression through pathways that are largely undefined. Two recent studies using RNA-Seq identified small chloroplast RNAs in cabbage (Wang et al. 2011) and tomato fruit (Mohorianu et al. 2011), excluding transcripts >100 nt. Other studies have used cDNA library sequencing and computational approaches to identify chloroplast ncRNAs (Lung et al. 2006; Georg et al. 2010), and small numbers of polyadenylated ncRNAs are present in EST libraries. However, there are several limitations to these methods, including low sensitivity, deliberate length restrictions, and reliance on specific sequence characteristics. The RNA-Seq method used here has a large dynamic range, facilitating discovery of low abundance transcripts (Wang et al. 2009), and it identifies expressed transcripts rather than relying on predictions of conserved sequence or structural features (Pichon and Felden 2008). This is important for chloroplast ncRNA identification, as promoters often share little sequence homology and inefficient transcription termination can result in multiple 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends (Bollenbach et al. 2008; Liere and Borner 2008). At the same time, this RNA-Seq method is restricted by strong RNA secondary structures, which can reduce the efficiency at which some oligonucleotides ligate to the oligonucleotides 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends. This drawback is mitigated by fractionation of the total RNA pool prior to oligonucleotide adaptation. Also, our method largely excludes RNAs of <80 nt, a tradeoff that reduces the amount of tRNAs and small rRNAs that would otherwise be highly sequenced. The pool of <80 nt chloroplast ncRNAs, however, has been covered by other studies cited above. Given that RNA-Seq yielded over 10 million sequences that aligned to the chloroplast genome from each genotype, it was important to filter this dataset for our purposes. Location was primarily constrained to regions antisense to known coding sequences to enrich for possible cis-encoded ncRNAs, and a threshold of \xe2\x89\xa550\xc3\x97 coverage per transcript was used to trigger follow-up analysis. Indeed, when the coverage of a potential ncRNA reached 50\xe2\x80\x93100\xc3\x97, 50% were confirmed by gel blot, and nearly 90% by RT-PCR, whereas >80% could be confirmed by gel blot when >150\xc3\x97 coverage was obtained (Figure 6). Given these outcomes, a lower threshold (e.g. 25\xe2\x80\x9350\xc3\x97 coverage) may identify a certain number of additional low abundance ncRNAs (i.e. those detectable by RT-PCR but less readily detectable by gel blot). For instance, a formerly characterized chloroplast asRNA, AS5, did not meet the RNA-Seq criteria due to its low endogenous expression (Hotto et al. 2010; Sharwood et al. 2011). Additionally, some chloroplast ncRNAs may only be expressed under particular developmental or stress conditions that were not used in this study. Percentage of ncRNAs detected by either RT-PCR (black bars) or RNA gel blot (gray bars) compared with the depth of RNA-Seq coverage. Total number of ncRNAs in each category prior to verification is in parentheses. Although we have called this RNA population ncRNAs, it is inevitable that some will have small open reading frames (ORF), either fortuitous or functional. In two cases, conserved open reading frames were present. The ncRNA as-psbK includes a 49 amino acid ORF with 72% identity to ORF44, which is encoded in an analogous position and stably transcribed in barley chloroplasts (Sexton et al. 1990) although it has no known function. A second example is a 58 amino acid ORF found within as-ndhD, which has 75\xe2\x80\x9398% identity to putative proteins encoded by the ndhD antisense strand in numerous chloroplast genomes. Although this ORF also has no attributed function, the apparent evolutionary selection for ORFs on both strands is striking. At a coverage of at least 1\xc3\x97 per nt, RNA-Seq data from both the WT and pnp1-1 spanned >99% of both chloroplast genome strands. From this, 107 putative ncRNAs met filtering criteria, and their distribution and verification status are shown in Figure 7. Of these, only as-rps16-I was identified in a previous study (Lung et al. 2006). Full symmetric transcription of the chloroplast genome is consistent with its well-described inefficient transcription termination, and it implies a heavy reliance on posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. Unwanted transcripts are likely distinguished from functional ones by the collective effects of RNA structures, RNA-binding proteins, and their sensitivities to RNases. We speculate that nonfunctional or detrimental ncRNAs are rapidly degraded, because cis-encoded asRNAs are inherently inhibitory to gene expression, a view supported by three published examples for chloroplasts (Nishimura et al. 2004; Hegeman et al. 2005; Hotto et al. 2010). This implies the ncRNAs accumulating to detectable levels may well retain functional roles. Summary of ncRNA analysis. The chloroplast genome is depicted in linear form, with the inverted repeats shown as heavy lines. The zero position corresponds to the beginning of the large single-copy region. Each ncRNA tentatively identified by RNA-Seq is shown; the legend at bottom right indicates the verification status. Chloroplast ncRNAs include both primary and processed transcripts emanating from ncRNA-specific promoters (e.g. as-accD; Figure 4) and those generated by cotranscription with an upstream gene. For example, as-ndhD-2 appears to be cotranscribed with ycf5, and as-psbK with trnS.1 (Figure 4B). There is a discrepancy with as-psbK because it fails to accumulate when plants are grown on spectinomycin (Figure 4A), showing it requires PEP, whereas the upstream trnS.1 gene is transcribed by NEP (Figure 4; Gruissem et al. 1986; Wu et al. 1997). We suggest that as-psbK is transcribed from an unidentified PEP promoter upstream of trnS.1, whereas initiation at its NEP promoter leads to transcription termination without read-through into as-psbK. In support of this hypothesis, we note that the as-psbK probe identified a 3.7 kb transcript that may extend upstream of trnS.1 and is PEP dependent (Figures 3A and 4A). We assessed the effects on ncRNA biogenesis of deficiencies for the two known chloroplast 3\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x86\x925\xe2\x80\xb2 exoribonucleases, cpPNPase and RNase R, the endoribonuclease RNase E, and the putative endoribonuclease and 5\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x80\xb2 exoribonuclease RNase J. The results were diverse, suggesting that there are several pathways responsible for ncRNA processing and accumulation. PNPase was previously shown to regulate bacterial ncRNAs, and the eukaryotic exosome (similar in function to PNPase) assists in the maturation and degradation of nuclear ncRNAs (Houseley et al. 2006; Viegas et al. 2007). Because cpPNPase plays a broad role in RNA metabolism (Germain et al. 2011), it was not surprising that it also acts on ncRNAs. Our data suggest two functions, namely, modulation of ncRNA abundance and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end maturation. Loss of RNase R had a major effect on both sense and antisense psbK RNAs; both were nearly depleted in mutant tissue. Chloroplast RNase R has previously been implicated in RNA maturation and accumulation of the asRNA AS5, transcribed from the rDNA region (Sharwood et al. 2011). In fact, rnr1-3 accumulates only 6% of the WT level of 5S rRNA, giving precedent for reduced RNA accumulation in this mutant. In that case, however, the asRNA increases in abundance, which led to the hypothesis that the asRNA destabilizes the sense transcript. In the case of psbK, the transcripts are coordinately affected, raising the possibility that they protect one another. The proximal cause of instability of one or both in the absence of RNase R remains to be ascertained. RNase E deficiency appeared to have a destabilizing effect on as-psbK, psbK, and nc-rbcL-accDint, whereas the rbcL-accDint sense strand transcript increased in abundance. Some E. coli ncRNAs were destabilized in the absence of RNase E, which may be due to direct RNase E\xe2\x80\x93ncRNA interactions or may result from changes in other mRNAs or unidentified interactors (Stead et al. 2010). RNase E could have a similar role with respect to chloroplast ncRNAs. The appearance of a sense strand rbcL-accD intergenic region is consistent with the postulated role of chloroplast RNase E in polycistronic transcript cleavage (Walter et al. 2010). Whether this transcript somehow destabilizes its antisense counterpart remains to be determined. RNase J has been little studied in chloroplasts. RNase E and RNase J have been shown to be partially redundant in Arabidopsis 5S-trnR processing, and RNase J has been shown to replace some RNase E functions in B. subtilis (Britton et al. 2007; Sharwood et al. 2011). We found here that RNase J\xe2\x80\x93deficient material accumulated an nc-rbcL-accDint precursor and had minor quantitative alterations for other ncRNAs. Taken together, these results indicate that multiple ribonucleases are involved in chloroplast ncRNA maturation and degradation. The ncRNAs identified in this study had origins throughout the chloroplast genome (Figure 7). Because accumulating asRNAs are complementary to all types of coding regions, including tRNAs, photosynthetic genes, and gene expression machinery, their regulatory roles could be quite diverse, similar to large-scale mechanisms of gene regulation attributed to bacterial ncRNAs (Repoila and Darfeuille 2009). The focus of this study was on cis-encoded asRNAs, although we cannot exclude the possibility that one or more also acts in trans. Potential functions of cis-encoded asRNAs are suggested by the region of complementarity to the corresponding sense RNA, as well as by the target mRNA location within an operon. At least 31 chloroplast ncRNAs overlap the translation initiation region of a complementary mRNA. In bacteria, base pairing of ncRNAs to the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of target transcripts is common. The outcome can be activation or repression of translation by altering ribosome accessibility to the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and/or start codon (Regnier and Hajnsdorf 2009). However, chloroplast mRNAs frequently lack SD elements and instead require upstream cis-elements and gene-specific trans-factors (Peled-Zehavi and Danon 2007), which may be targets of ncRNAs. The in vitro translation system available for chloroplasts offers one avenue to test these hypotheses (Yukawa et al. 2007). At least 39 chloroplast ncRNAs are complementary to the sense strand mRNA 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end. Bacterial ncRNAs that bind to mRNA 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends often stabilize the mRNA by blocking 3\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x86\x925\xe2\x80\xb2 exoribonucleases. This is the case for E. coli GadY, which stabilizes the cis-encoded GadX mRNA (Opdyke et al. 2004). Chloroplast transcript 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends are often stabilized by a stem-loop\xe2\x80\x93forming inverted repeat, but not all mRNAs possess predicted 3\xe2\x80\xb2 stem loops, and these would be candidates for ncRNA-mediated stabilization. A possible example is as-psbT, which was hypothesized to stabilize the complementary psbT mRNA under oxidative stress conditions (Zghidi-Abouzid et al. 2011). Approximately 40 chloroplast asRNAs are complementary only to the coding region of mRNAs, and some of these putative mRNA targets are within operons. Bacterial ncRNAs that bind to their target within the coding region can alter transcript stability by creating or blocking a ribonuclease binding site (Pfeiffer et al. 2009). Additionally, bacterial ncRNAs can alter transcript accumulation within an operon, one example being RhyB, which downregulates the iscSUA genes within the iscRSUA operon to allow independent accumulation of iscR (Desnoyers et al. 2009). Similar scenarios could be envisioned for chloroplast ncRNAs, leading to differential accumulation of transcripts within a gene cluster. Overall, RNA-Seq analysis proved extremely useful for identifying chloroplast ncRNAs, as approximately 45% were further validated by experimental means. We suspect that this method will also be useful for characterization of other transcriptomes, particularly organellar ones that benefit from the deep coverage of the low-complexity genomes inherent in total RNA analysis.

6,"['Siobhan Moore', 'Lewis Lukens']","December 8, 2011.",An Evaluation of Arabidopsis thaliana Hybrid Traits and Their Genetic Control,"b'Heterosis is an important phenomenon in agriculture. However, heterosis often greatly varies among hybrids and among traits. To investigate heterosis across a large number of traits and numerous genotypes, we evaluated 12 life history traits on parents and hybrids derived from five Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes (Col, Ler-0, Cvi, Ws, and C24) by using a complete diallel analysis containing 20 hybrids. Parental contributions to heterosis were hybrid and trait specific with a few reciprocal differences. Most notably, C24 generated hybrids with flowering time, biomass, and reproductive traits that often exceeded high-parent values. However, reproductive traits of C24 and Col hybrids and flowering time traits of C24 and Ler hybrids had no heterosis. We investigated whether allelic variation at flowering time genes FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) could explain the genotype- and trait-specific contribution of C24 to hybrid traits. We evaluated both Col and Ler lines introgressed with various FRI and FLC alleles and hybrids between these lines and C24. Hybrids with functional FLC differed from hybrids with nonfunctional FLC for 21 of the 24 hybrid-trait combinations. In most crosses, heterosis was fully or partially explained by FRI and FLC. Our results describe the genetic diversity for heterosis within a sample of A. thaliana ecotypes and show that FRI and FLC are major factors that contribute to heterosis in a genotype and trait specific fashion.The occurrence of heterosis, or hybrid vigor, is a phenomenon in which the hybrid offspring between two parental lines has trait values that surpass the trait values of the parents (Crow 1948). The phenomenon of heterosis was noted as far back as 1876 by Charles Darwin (Shull 1908). Heterosis is often referred to in traits associated with vigor, such as size, yield, and reproductive success (Lippman and Zamir 2007), but the term is also used more broadly to describe any trait for which a hybrid exceeds parental levels (Xiao et al. 1995). Heterosis in both the narrow and broad senses is prevalent in numerous species and has been critical for agricultural productivity for many decades (Whaley 1944). Arabidopsis thaliana offers a tractable model system to investigate the genetic basis of heterosis. Although A. thaliana is autogamous, and heterosis is predicted to be low, heterosis has been found to be widespread among various A. thaliana hybrids. Heterosis has been reported for the rate of early biomass accumulation and for yield-related traits, including biomass yield, number of seeds, and 1000-seed weight (Barth et al. 2003; Meyer et al. 2004; Kusterer et al. 2007a; Kusterer et al. 2007b). In most studies within Arabidopsis investigators have focused on elucidating the genetic basis for heterosis by examining one or a small number of traits or by using a small number of crosses. However, heterosis is variable across traits and across genotypes (Barth et al. 2003; Meyer et al. 2004; Syed and Chen 2005; Springer and Stupar 2007; Stupar et al. 2008; Flint-Garcia et al. 2009). One hybrid trait may exhibit heterosis, whereas a second trait may have a lower level of heterosis, be unaffected, or be lower than parental trait values (Barth et al. 2003; Syed and Chen 2005; Springer and Stupar 2007; Stupar et al. 2008; Flint-Garcia et al. 2009). One genotype may exhibit extensive heterosis for a trait, whereas another genotype may have little to no heterosis for the same trait (Barth et al. 2003; Meyer et al. 2004; Stupar et al. 2008). Furthermore, reciprocal hybrids may differ in trait expression. A number of A. thaliana reciprocal hybrids, including Col-0 x C24 and Cvi x Ler, differed for biomass, seed size, and seed yield. These reciprocal differences have been attributed to nonmaternal genetic factors and to maternal nuclear or cytoplasmic effects (Alonso-Blanco et al. 1999; Barth et al. 2003). Heterosis within A. thaliana has been attributed to dominance, overdominance, pseudo-overdominance, and/or epistasis depending on the traits and the crosses examined. Heterosis for viability in a cross between the Niederzenz and Landsberg ecotypes of A. thaliana was attributed to overdominance, i.e. F2 progeny homozygous for one locus had 50% lower viability than heterozygotes (Mitchell-Olds 1995). Single-locus heterosis attributable to overdominance has been observed for stem length, total number of buds, flowers and fruit, and fresh and dry weight (R\xc3\xa9dei 1962). Kusterer et al. (2007a) and Kusterer et al. (2007b) examined C24 x Col-derived recombinant inbred lines crossed to both parents and the F1 and found that heterosis for biomass-related traits within 29 days of sowing was caused by dominance, overdominance or pseudo-overdominance, and epistasis. The authors of an analysis of early growth in C24 x Col near isogenic line hybrids found a significant role for epistasis (Melchinger et al. 2007). The flowering time genes FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) interact epistatically and have a large effect on flowering time. Genotypes with functional alleles at both the FRI and FLC loci flower much later than genotypes that carry only one functional allele when plants are not vernalized (Lee et al. 1994; Sanda and Amasino 1995). Late flowering in interspecific allotetraploids between A. thaliana and A. arenosa has also been attributed to functional alleles of FRI and FLC because a functional A. arenosa FRI allele trans-activated an A. thaliana FLC allele (Wang et al. 2006). FRI and FLC may affect other traits because mutations in flowering time genes can cause changes in leaf number, the number of axillary flowering shoots, final height, silique number, total number of seeds, floral organ development, as well as other traits (Tienderen et al. 1996; Koornneef et al. 1998; Alonso-Blanco et al. 1999). In this study, we first investigated how heterosis varies across 12 diverse traits measured in 20 hybrids derived from five parental genotypes. We used a complete diallel design to determine the contribution of each genotype on each trait by estimating general (additive) and specific (nonadditive) combining abilities as well as reciprocal effects. Second, we determined the degree to which genetic variation at FRI and FLC explains a number of hybrid traits across different genotypes. We suggest that genes or genotypes interpreted as having additive effects may interact nonadditively to generate hybrid trait variation.'","b'Heterosis is an important phenomenon in agriculture.

We evaluated both Col and Ler lines introgressed with various FRI and FLC alleles and hybrids between these lines and C24.

One hybrid trait may exhibit heterosis, whereas a second trait may have a lower level of heterosis, be unaffected, or be lower than parental trait values (Barth et al. 2003; Syed and Chen 2005; Springer and Stupar 2007; Stupar et al. 2008; Flint-Garcia et al. 2009). One genotype may exhibit extensive heterosis for a trait, whereas another genotype may have little to no heterosis for the same trait (Barth et al. 2003; Meyer et al. 2004; Stupar et al. 2008). Furthermore, reciprocal hybrids may differ in trait expression. A number of A. thaliana reciprocal hybrids, including Col-0 x C24 and Cvi x Ler, differed for biomass, seed size, and seed yield. These reciprocal differences have been attributed to nonmaternal genetic factors and to maternal nuclear or cytoplasmic effects (Alonso-Blanco et al. 1999; Barth et al. 2003). Heterosis within A. thaliana has been attributed to dominance, overdominance, pseudo-overdominance, and/or epistasis depending on the traits and the crosses examined. Heterosis for viability in a cross between the Niederzenz and Landsberg ecotypes of A. thaliana was attributed to overdominance, i.e. F2 progeny homozygous for one locus had 50% lower viability than heterozygotes (Mitchell-Olds 1995). Single-locus heterosis attributable to overdominance has been observed for stem length, total number of buds, flowers and fruit, and fresh and dry weight (R\xc3\xa9dei 1962). Kusterer et al. (2007a) and Kusterer et al. (2007b) examined C24 x Col-derived recombinant inbred lines crossed to both parents and the F1 and found that heterosis for biomass-related traits within 29 days of sowing was caused by dominance, overdominance or pseudo-overdominance, and epistasis. The authors of an analysis of early growth in C24 x Col near isogenic line hybrids found a significant role for epistasis (Melchinger et al. 2007). The flowering time genes FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) interact epistatically and have a large effect on flowering time. Genotypes with functional alleles at both the FRI and FLC loci flower much later than genotypes that carry only one functional allele when plants are not vernalized (Lee et al. 1994; Sanda and Amasino 1995). Late flowering in interspecific allotetraploids between A. thaliana and A. arenosa has also been attributed to functional alleles of FRI and FLC because a functional A. arenosa FRI allele trans-activated an A. thaliana FLC allele (Wang et al. 2006). FRI and FLC may affect other traits because mutations in flowering time genes can cause changes in leaf number, the number of axillary flowering shoots, final height, silique number, total number of seeds, floral organ development, as well as other traits (Tienderen et al. 1996; Koornneef et al. 1998; Alonso-Blanco et al. 1999). In this study, we first investigated how heterosis varies across 12 diverse traits measured in 20 hybrids derived from five parental genotypes. We used a complete diallel design to determine the contribution of each genotype on each trait by estimating general (additive) and specific (nonadditive) combining abilities as well as reciprocal effects. Second, we determined the degree to which genetic variation at FRI and FLC explains a number of hybrid traits across different genotypes. We suggest that genes or genotypes interpreted as having additive effects may interact nonadditively to generate hybrid trait variation. Plants were grown under long day conditions with 16 hr (07:00\xe2\x80\x9323:00) of ~150 \xc2\xb5mol m-2 s-1 light and 8 hr of dark at a constant temperature of 23\xc2\xb0. Eleven traits were measured, and one reproductive trait, total seed per plant, was estimated (Table 1). Days to bolting, days to flowering, and days to mature seed were the three flowering time traits. Rosette diameter at bolting, shoot biomass at death, and final height at death were the three biomass traits. Total number of siliques, average silique length, average number of seeds per silique, and total number of seeds per plant were the four reproductive traits. The total number of seeds for each plant was estimated by multiplying the total number of siliques by the average number of seeds per silique. We also measured height at flowering and lifespan. Death was defined as the day the last silique matured and the plant was no longer producing new branches. Additional details on growth conditions and trait measurements are given in the supporting information (File S1). Five A. thaliana parental lines, i.e. Columbia (Col), Wassilewskija (Ws), Landsberg erecta (Ler), Cape Verde Islands (Cvi), and C24, were mated by the use of a complete diallel mating design. The diallel consisted of 20 hybrids, including reciprocals, and the manually crossed five parental genotypes, for a total of 25 lines. The diallel plants were examined by the use of a split plot design consisting of four split-plots with 25 cells each that formed two whole plot replicates. The whole-plot factor, density, had two levels, high and low. Density stress was imposed upon plants as an environmental effect because heterosis may be more evident in conditions of stress (Tollenaar and Wu 1999). The high-density treatment consisted of the plant of interest located in the center of a 3.5-inch pot surrounded by four Ler parent plants (2 cm spacing) within the same cell. The low-density treatment consisted of only the genotype of interest centered in a pot. The split-plot factor, genotype, with 25 levels was randomly assigned to the 25 cells within each flat. Each pot was re-randomized within its flat every 6 days to ensure homogeneity within the flat and to eliminate edge effects. Rearranging ceased approximately 3 months after the start of the experiment. Cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences marker analysis of DNA extracted from each hybrid and inbred plant was used to confirm plant genotypes. Manual pollinations were used to produce all seed. Among the 100 plants, three were not of the expected genotype and were removed (two Ws x Cvi and one Col x Ws). To investigate the effects of FRI and FLC in nearly isogenic backgrounds, we used lines homozygous for the four combinations of functional and nonfunctional FRI and FLC alleles. Each FRI and FLC combination was obtained in the Col background and the Ler background. For simplicity, each line has been given a short notation to refer to its FRI and FLC alleles. A +/+ indicates a line with a functional FRI and a functional FLC allele, whereas +/\xe2\x88\x92 indicates a line with a functional FRI allele and a nonfunctional FLC allele. A \xe2\x88\x92/+ indicates a genotype with a nonfunctional FRI allele and a functional FLC allele, whereas \xe2\x88\x92/\xe2\x88\x92 indicates a genotype with nonfunctional alleles for both FRI and FLC. We investigated two Ler \xe2\x88\x92/+ genotypes. In one, the functional FLC was introgressed from Col. In the other, it was introgressed from Sf2. Additional details on the lines are given in supporting information. To investigate the effect of FLC in hybrid backgrounds, we generated (C24 x Col) +/+ and (C24 x Ler) +/+ F1 hybrids and (C24 x Col) +/\xe2\x88\x92 and (C24 x Ler) +/\xe2\x88\x92 F1 hybrids. Introgression lines and their hybrids with C24 were evaluated by the use of a randomized complete block design with six blocks. Each of the nine isogenic genotypes [Col \xe2\x88\x92/\xe2\x88\x92, \xe2\x88\x92/+, +/\xe2\x88\x92, and +/+, as well as Ler \xe2\x88\x92/\xe2\x88\x92, \xe2\x88\x92/+ (Sf2), \xe2\x88\x92/+ (Col), +/\xe2\x88\x92, and +/+], the four hybrid genotypes [(C24 x Col) +/+, (C24 x Col) +/\xe2\x88\x92, (C24 x Ler) +/+, and (C24 x Ler) +/\xe2\x88\x92], and the C24 +/\xe2\x88\x92 parental genotype were randomly placed within each block for a total of 84 plants (14 plants per block with six blocks). To partition phenotypic variation to density and genotypic effects, data from the five parent complete diallel design was analyzed with DIALLEL-SAS05 via the use of Griffing\xe2\x80\x99s method 1 (Griffing 1956; Zhang and Kang 1997; Zhang et al. 2005). Genotypes were treated as fixed effects. Variances attributed to interactions between density and genotype were also determined. Genotypic variance was partitioned into general combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA), and reciprocal effects, which were further partitioned to maternal and nonmaternal effects. We also used a split-plot analysis to analyze diallel data to estimate hybrid deviations from mid-, low-, and high-parent values and to perform contrasts between genotypes. Finally, we used the following equation to calculate heterosis of the diallel hybrids:where F1 is the mean trait value of a specific hybrid. For mid-parent heterosis (MPH), X is the mean trait value of the two parents of the hybrid; for high-parent heterosis (HPH), X is the mean trait value of the high parent. The introgression line and hybrid introgression line experiment was analyzed with a randomized complete block design model. Within the introgression line analysis, contrasts were performed among Col and Ler introgression lines to evaluate the effects of FRI and FLC on trait values within the inbred genotypes. For the hybrids between C24 and the introgression lines, we contrasted the hybrid with FLC to the hybrid without FLC to determine the effect of FLC when a functional FRI was present. A type I error rate of alpha = 0.01 was used to define statistical significance unless otherwise stated. Analyses were performed with SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA 2002-2003) general linear model procedure. Data used in all analyses are given in the supporting information (Table S2, Table S3, Table S4, Table S5, and Table S6). To determine the parental genotypic contributions to A. thaliana hybrid traits, we evaluated 12 traits by using a complete diallel design comprising five parental ecotypes (Col, Cvi, Ler, Ws, and C24) and 20 F1 hybrids. Genotype explained a highly significant (P < 0.0001) proportion of the variation for every trait except plant lifespan (Table 2). The genetic components of variation for rosette diameter and days to bolting, flowering and mature seed were especially high. The mean square estimates for genotype were over 60x the mean square errors for these traits (Table 2). The genotype mean square estimates for the remaining 7 traits ranged from 5 to 32 times the mean square error. For the 11 traits that had significant genotypic effects, the variance of GCA, that is, the difference between the average trait value of a specific parent\xe2\x80\x99s offspring and the average trait value of the population, was highly significant (P < 0.0001; Table 2). Of the five parental lines, C24 consistently had the largest effect on traits, having positive GCA estimates for 10 of 12 traits (Figure 1). This was also seen in heterosis measurements (e.g., Figure 2). Of the 75 hybrid-trait combinations with significant HPH, 62 were in hybrids that had C24 as a parent (Figure 2, A\xe2\x80\x93D, Figure 3, and Figure S1). For eight of the traits (days to bolting, flowering and mature seed; rosette diameter; shoot biomass; final height; total siliques; and total seeds), HPH was predominately restricted to hybrids where C24 was used as a parent (Figure 2, A\xe2\x80\x93C, Figure 3, and Figure S1). Interestingly, height at flowering was often shorter in the late flowering C24 hybrids than in the early flowering parental lines (Figure 2E).

The percent heterosis was calculated for each genotype and for each trait for all hybrids within the diallel experiment. The letter in the cell indicates which traits have HPH at P < 0.05 (A, days to bolting; B, days to flowering; C, days to mature seed; D, rosette diameter; E, shoot biomass; F, final height; G, total number of siliques; H, total number of seeds; I, silique length; J, number of seeds per silique; K, height at flowering; L, lifespan). The color gradient from light to dark represents a low to high number of traits with HPH for the genotype. The maternal genotype is on the vertical axis and the paternal genotype is on the horizontal axis. Although the C24 parent had a large, positive effect on many hybrids, this effect varied greatly. Largely because of the different effects of C24 on hybrids, the SCA, the estimated deviation of the trait value of an individual cross from the sum of the parental GCA effects, explained a highly significant proportion (P < 0.0001) of the genetic variance for all 11 traits (Table 2). For most flowering time traits (days to bolting, flowering, and mature seed) and biomass traits (rosette diameter, shoot biomass, final height), C24 hybrids with Ws had very high SCA estimates, C24 hybrids with Col and Cvi had high SCA estimates, and C24 hybrids with Ler had negative SCA estimates (Figure 1, A\xe2\x88\x92F). The effect of C24 on hybrids also varied for reproductive traits. Almost all of the reproductive traits in hybrids between C24 with Cvi, Ler, and Ws (3 hybrids \xc3\x97 2 reciprocals \xc3\x97 4 yield traits = 24 hybrid \xc3\x97 reproductive trait combinations) had significant (17) or marginally significant (3) HPH (Figure 3), a pattern mimicked in the SCA estimates (Figure 1, G\xe2\x88\x92J). In contrast, no reproductive trait exhibited HPH in the hybrids between C24 and Col. These hybrids had 228 fewer siliques, 11,000 fewer seeds, 1-mm shorter siliques, and over 2 fewer seeds per silique than predicted by parental GCA estimates (Figure 1, G\xe2\x88\x92J). A small number of hybrids without C24 as a parent, most notably hybrids with Ler, exhibited heterotic traits. For example, hybrids between Ler and Ws exceeded both parental lines in silique length, height at flowering, and number of seeds per silique (Figure 2, D\xe2\x80\x93E, Figure 3). The Ler x Ws hybrid was 43% taller than the tallest parent at flowering (Figure 2E). Ler is homozygous for the recessive erecta gene that reduces plant height at flowering and silique length. All eight Ler hybrids had significant MPH for silique length, and all but one Ler hybrid had significant MPH for height at flowering (Figure S1). Heterosis was rare in hybrids that had neither C24 nor Ler as a parent. Of the 72 parent-hybrid trait comparisons among Col, Cvi, and Ws, three had marginally significant HPH (Figure 3). Reciprocal effects explained less genotypic variance than did GCA and SCA, but they were marginally significant for four traits and significant for five others: number of days to bolting, days to flowering, days to mature seed, average silique length, and average seeds per silique (Table 2). The five significant reciprocal effects were partitioned into maternal and nonmaternal effects. These were significant or marginally significant for all five traits (Table 2). For example, C24 had a positive, maternal effect on flowering time, and Ws had a marginally significant (P < 0.05) negative, maternal effect on flowering time (Table S1). However, the difference between C24 x Ws and Ws x C24 flowering times (e.g., days to flowering was 43% later than the high parent vs. 15% later than the high parent, respectively) was greater than could be accounted for by maternal effects (Figure 2A, Table S1). We also examined the effects of both low- and high-density plantings on traits. Density had a significant effect on the total number of siliques (P = 0.003) and a marginally significant effect on total seeds, final height, and shoot biomass (Table 2). Genotype x density interactions were not significant (Table 2). C24 was a parent of most hybrids within the diallel that exhibited heterotic traits, and the effect of C24 varied across traits and hybrids. C24 has a functional FRI allele and a weak FLC allele (Sanda and Amasino 1995). Col, Cvi, and Ws all have nonfunctional FRI alleles and strong FLC alleles (Lee et al. 1993; Koornneef et al. 1994; Lee et al. 1994; Alonso-Blanco et al. 1998; Michaels and Amasino 1999; Johanson et al. 2000; Gazzani et al. 2003). Ler has a nonfunctional FRI allele and a weak FLC allele (Koornneef et al. 1994; Lee et al. 1994; Michaels and Amasino 2001). As described previously, FRI and FLC have been shown to interact epistatically within inbred genotypes to delay flowering. We used Ler and Col ecotypes introgressed with functional and nonfunctional FLC and FRI alleles to determine if allelic variation at FRI and FLC explained the flowering time traits and other traits of C24 hybrids. To determine if FLC contributed to C24 hybrid trait values, we compared C24 hybrids with a functional FLC to hybrids without a functional FLC [e.g. (C24 x Col) +/+ hybrids compared with (C24 x Col) +/\xe2\x88\x92 hybrids and (C24 x Ler) +/+ hybrids compared with (C24 x Ler) +/\xe2\x88\x92 hybrids]. To evaluate the degree to which FRI and FLC alleles could explain the C24 hybrid phenotypes, we compared hybrids with functional FRI and FLC (+/+) to the introgression lines with functional FRI and FLC (+/+), and we compared hybrids with functional FRI only (+/\xe2\x88\x92) to the inbred introgression lines with FRI only (+/\xe2\x88\x92). If +/+ and +/\xe2\x88\x92 introgression lines resembled +/+ and +/\xe2\x88\x92 hybrid lines, respectively, then FRI and FLC fully accounted for the hybrid phenotype. Functional alleles of FRI and FLC explained heterosis for flowering time traits in the hybrids between C24 and Col (Figure 4A, Figure S2, Figure S3). For example, Col +/+ flowered after 51 days and the (C24 x Col) +/+ hybrid flowered after 50 days. The Col +/\xe2\x88\x92 line flowered after 26 days and the (C24 x Col) +/\xe2\x88\x92 hybrid flowered after 29 days (Figure 4A). Within Ler and C24 hybrids, FRI and FLC contributed to hybrid flowering time traits but did not fully explain them. The Ler +/\xe2\x88\x92 line resembled the (C24 x Ler) +/\xe2\x88\x92 hybrid for all flowering time traits (for example, 31 days to flowering vs. 32 days). However, the Ler +/+ inbred line bolted, flowered, and matured later than the (C24 x Ler) +/+ hybrid (for example, 76 days to flowering vs. 50 days) (Figure 4A, Figure S3). The large effects of functional FRI and FLC on flowering time traits were the result of epistasis. For example, flowering was delayed by 114% (27 days) in Col +/+ relative to Col \xe2\x88\x92/\xe2\x88\x92 (Figure 4A), but FRI and FLC individually had no effect, as Col +/\xe2\x88\x92 and Col \xe2\x88\x92/+ did not differ from Col \xe2\x88\x92/\xe2\x88\x92 (Figure 4A). This finding is consistent with previous reports (Lee et al. 1994; Lee and Amasino 1995; Michaels and Amasino 1999). Although genotype was not a significant component of lifespan variance within the diallel, in the introgression experiment, both (C24 x Col) +/+ and (C24 x Ler) +/+ lived significantly longer than their parents (Figure 4B). The increased hybrid lifespan of C24 x Col (+/+) could be fully ascribed to an epistatic interaction between FRI and FLC (Figure 4B). The effects of FRI and FLC on isogenic line and C24 hybrid traits. The mean trait values of fourteen Col, Ler, C24 x Col and C24 x Ler lines with various FRI and FLC allele combinations are plotted. (A) Mean number of days to flowering. (B) Mean height at flowering. (C) Mean rosette diameter. (D) Mean final height. (E) Mean total number of siliques. (F) Mean lifespan. Functional or strong alleles are indicated by \xe2\x80\x9c+\xe2\x80\x9d, whereas nonfunctional or weak alleles are indicated by \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9d. The FRI allele is listed before the \xe2\x80\x9c/\xe2\x80\x9d and the FLC allele is listed after. The shade of the bars indicates the genotypic background: solid gray bars are Col inbred lines; black bars are Ler inbred lines; white bars are C24 lines; striped gray and white bars are hybrids between Col and C24; and striped black and white bars are hybrids between Ler and C24. Bars with different letters are significantly different at P < 0.05. Among the diallel genotypes, C24 hybrids often had a low height at flowering. Variation within FRI and FLC contribute to this trait in the hybrids because the (+/+) C24 hybrids with Ler were significantly shorter at flowering than the corresponding C24 x Ler (+/\xe2\x88\x92) hybrids, and the (+/+) C24 hybrids with Col were nominally shorter than the (+/\xe2\x88\x92) C24 hybrids with Col (Figure 4C). In addition, the (+/+) Col and Ler genotypes were significantly shorter than the (+/\xe2\x88\x92) introgression lines and resembled their respective (+/+) hybrids (Figure 4C). Like flowering time heterosis, biomass trait heterosis was affected by FRI and FLC. Within hybrids and introgression lines, the effects of FRI and FLC on rosette diameter were similar to their effects on flowering time traits, except C24 (+/\xe2\x88\x92) hybrids were larger than their respective (+/\xe2\x88\x92) inbreds (Figure 4D). For example, the Col +/+ line had a rosette diameter that was 203% larger than the Col \xe2\x88\x92/\xe2\x88\x92 line, and neither functional FRI nor FLC alone had a significant effect in the Col isogenic background (Figure 4D). In the Col genetic background, the effects of FRI and FLC on final plant height and stem biomass were similar to their effects on rosette diameter (Figure 4E, Figure S3). In contrast, in Ler, both FRI and FLC had positive effects on stem biomass but no significant effect on final height (Figure 4E, Figure S3). Finally, we found strong evidence that FRI and FLC negatively interact to reduce seed yields in the C24 and Col hybrids, largely explaining the poor performance of this hybrid in the diallel experiment. All (C24 x Col) +/\xe2\x88\x92 hybrids had significant HPH for reproductive traits (total siliques, total seeds, silique length, and seeds per silique), and no (C24 x Col) +/+ hybrid had HPH for these traits (Figure 4F, Figure S3). For example, the (C24 x Col) +/+ hybrid had 29% fewer siliques and 17% fewer seeds per silique than the (C24 x Col) +/\xe2\x88\x92 hybrid (Figure 4F, Figure S3). The poor hybrid seed production was likely the result of epistasis. The Col +/+ line averaged 55% fewer siliques, 76% fewer seeds, an 18% decrease in silique length, and a 34% decrease in the average number of seeds per silique compared to the Col \xe2\x88\x92/\xe2\x88\x92 line, whereas Col \xe2\x88\x92/\xe2\x88\x92, Col \xe2\x88\x92/+, and Col +/\xe2\x88\x92 did not significantly differ from each other for these traits (Figure 4F, Figure S3). A strong FLC in the C24 x Ler hybrid reduced the number of seeds per silique, but the total number of seed and silique length were not significantly different from the C24 x Ler hybrid without FLC (Figure S3). A strong FLC increased the total number of siliques in the (C24 x Ler) +/+ hybrid compared to the (C24 x Ler) +/\xe2\x88\x92 hybrid (Figure 4F). Within the Ler introgression lines, an epistatic interaction caused a significant reduction in reproductive traits because the Ler +/+ line had lower trait values than expected given the individual effects of FRI and FLC (Figure 4F, Figure S3). To investigate how environment and genotype contribute to heterosis for 12 A. thaliana life history traits, we grew 20 hybrids from five parental A. thaliana genotypes in two planting densities by using a complete diallel design. Genotype and its GCA and SCA partitions explained a highly significant proportion of the variation for all but one trait, lifespan. A very high proportion of the variation for flowering time traits and a high but lower proportion of reproductive trait variation were explained by GCA and SCA. Other genetic studies have reported that flowering time trait variation has a relatively strong genetic component and reproductive traits have a relatively weak genetic component. For example, genetic variances for flowering time traits were high relative to variances for reproductive traits in Brassica carinata (Teklewold and Becker 2005). Variation in reproductive traits likely does have a strong genetic component. However, yield is a highly environmentally sensitive, multigenic trait (Hittalmani et al. 2003, Goff 2011), and yield traits thus have relatively high variation among replicates of the same genotype. Indeed, in our study, the coefficients of variation for total seeds and total siliques were greater than the coefficients of variation for flowering time traits (data not shown). Far more than other ecotypes, C24 produced hybrids that exhibited heterotic traits. Most traits in hybrids between C24 and Cvi as well as between C24 and Ws exceeded parental levels (Figure 3). Hybrids between C24 and Col flowered late and had large biomasses, but the hybrids\xe2\x80\x99 reproductive traits did not exceed parental levels (Figure 3). Hybrids between C24 and Ler did not flower late, had moderate heterosis for biomass, and exceeded parental levels for reproductive traits (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The fact that heterosis for flowering time and yield co-occur in some hybrids but not others could explain reported differences in flowering time and yield correlations. For example, Aarssen and Clauss (1992) reported that late flowering plants with substantial vegetative growth generate large yields under favorable growth conditions. In contrast, Pigliucci and Schlichting (1995) reported that bolting time and plant size were negatively correlated to seed and fruit production. Reciprocal effects accounted for a small component of the genetic variance compared to GCA and SCA effects and were significant for three flowering time and two yield traits. For these traits, both maternal and nonmaternal effects were significant or marginally significant. Maternal and nonmaternal effects may have an impact on reciprocal hybrids that rival the effect of the nuclear genotype (Corey et al. 1976; Alonso-Blanco et al. 1999). For example, Corey et al. (1976) found that maternal effects accounted for more variance for five early growth traits in a diallel analysis than did the GCA and SCA effects. Maternal effects usually have a larger effect on seed traits and traits early in a plant\xe2\x80\x99s life than traits that express late in life (Kromer and Gross 1987). Although a number of reciprocal hybrids had substantially different yield and flowering time trait values, the traits we measured may explain why reciprocal effects played a relatively small role. High density caused significant reductions in total number of siliques (Table 2), and density x genotype interactions were not significant. Previous studies in Arabidopsis have shown that high planting densities reduce plant size, accelerate flowering time, reduce leaf size, and decrease fecundity because of competition and/or red-far red signals (Aarssen and Clauss 1992; Franklin and Whitelam 2005; Keuskamp and Pierik 2010). A. thaliana hybrids are also more tolerant than inbreds to some stresses such as temperature (Griffing and Langridge 1963). The absence of widespread density effects and possibly the absence of density x genotype interactions are likely the result of the mild density stress. Within hybrids between C24 and Col, we found that FLC and FRI fully accounted for flowering time trait heterosis and largely accounted for rosette diameter and shoot biomass heterosis. These findings are remarkable because they suggest that all genetic differences between C24 and Col outside of these two genes do not contribute to heterosis for these traits. Allelic variation in other genes may be rare because naturally occurring alleles in genes other than FRI and FLC may have pleiotropic detrimental effects, as suggested by both Koornneef et al. (1994) and Johanson et al. (2000). Alternatively, genes that do differ between Col and C24 could have subtle effects in long day, unvernalized growth conditions. For example, in two studies several small-effect QTL affecting flowering time were detected only after FLC was down-regulated through vernalization (Alonso-Blanco et al. 1998; Werner et al. 2005; Strange et al. 2011). FLC also contributed to the low yield of the C24 and Col hybrid and likely to its short height at flowering. The effect FLC on traits other than flowering time traits may be caused by FLC\xe2\x80\x99s direct role in the development of these traits, because of its effect on flowering time that in turn affects these traits, or both. The negative effect of FLC on height at flowering appears to be structurally related to flowering time. Koornneef et al. (1994) described a dominant late flowering mutant florens (F)\xe2\x80\x94one of the latest flowering Arabidopsis genotypes\xe2\x80\x94as having a poorly elongated main stem, and Pigliucci and Schlichting (1995) also found that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

late flowering plants consistently have a low height at flowering. We postulate that the role of FLC on reproductive development is attributable in part to its participation in this process. Loss-of-function mutations in FCA, which negatively regulates FLC, affect silique production in addition to the vegetative to floral transition (Tienderen et al. 1996; Macknight et al. 1997). FLC is expressed in multiple tissues during Arabidopsis development, including the root, aerial tissue, rosette leaves, and floral buds (Sheldon et al. 2000). In addition, FLC has a large number of promoter binding sites in genes that are involved in a number of developmental pathways, including reproductive development (Deng et al. 2011). A mutant flowering time gene in tomato, SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT), an ortholog of A. thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) (Krieger et al. 2010), causes heterosis of inflorescence number and flowers per inflorescence. FLC had a smaller effect on traits in C24 and Ler hybrids than in C24 and Col hybrids. There were no heterotic traits for which both Ler (+/+) mimicked (C24 x Ler) +/+ and Ler (+/\xe2\x88\x92) mimicked (C24 x Ler) +/\xe2\x88\x92. FLC likely had a relatively weak role in C24 x Ler heterosis because of the strong phenotypic effect of erecta, which was complemented in the hybrid. Indeed, hybrids of a tester line with angustifolia (an) and erecta (er) mutants resulted in heterosis for numerous traits, including length of the main stem, total number of siliques, and both fresh and dry weight (R\xc3\xa9dei 1962). For most traits, we found that FRI and FLC interact epistatically to positively or negatively influence phenotypic values. Manipulating such epistatic interactions may be a general mechanism to improve traits in breeding populations. The yield increase in tomatoes caused by heterozygosity at SFT is due to suppression of growth termination imposed by the SELF PRUNING (SP) gene (Krieger et al. 2010). The high performance of elite European rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera) is caused in part by beneficial epistatic interactions (Werner et al. 1989; Engqvist and Becker 1991), and Lamkey et al. (1995) proposed that elite maize genotypes have favorable epistatic interactions between linked genes. By extension, selection of lines with favorable GCA, or additive, trait estimates for further development may not be a productive method to enhance hybrid traits. In this study, C24 had significant, positive GCA estimates, but GCA alone poorly predicted hybrid traits because of epistasis between FRI and FLC. As the genetic basis for hybrid trait variation is studied in greater depth, we predict epistasis will have a major role in its explanation.

Large staphylococcal plasmids commonly carry antibiotic resistances and virulence loci, but relatively few have been completely sequenced. We determined the plasmid content of 280 staphylococci isolated in diverse geographical regions from the 1940s to the 2000s and found that 79% of strains carried at least one large plasmid >20 kb and that 75% of these large plasmids were 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb. Using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, we grouped 43% of all large plasmids into three major families, showing remarkably conserved intercontinental spread of multiresistant staphylococcal plasmids over seven decades. In total, we sequenced 93 complete and 57 partial staphylococcal plasmids ranging in size from 1.3 kb to 64.9 kb, tripling the number of complete sequences for staphylococcal plasmids >20 kb in the NCBI RefSeq database. These plasmids typically carried multiple antimicrobial and metal resistances and virulence genes, transposases and recombinases. Remarkably, plasmids within each of the three main families were >98% identical, apart from insertions and deletions, despite being isolated from strains decades apart and on different continents. This suggests enormous selective pressure has optimized the content of certain plasmids despite their large size and complex organization.Staphylococci are common commensals and opportunistic pathogens mainly found on the skin and in the nose of humans and also in domestic and companion animals (Epstein et al. 2009; Lindsay 2010; Middleton et al. 2005; Rubin et al. 2011; Rutland et al. 2009; Spohr et al. 2011; Sung et al. 2008; Van Duijkeren et al. 2011; Vanderhaeghen et al. 2011; Walther et al. 2009; Wassenberg et al. 2011). Staphylococcus aureus, carried by \xe2\x88\xbc30% of humans in developed countries (Lindsay and Holden 2004; Plata et al. 2009), is a leading cause of healthcare-associated (HA) infections and is increasingly responsible for life-threatening community-acquired (CA) infections in otherwise healthy persons (Diekema et al. 2001; Lindsay and Holden 2004, 2006; Navarro et al. 2008; Plata et al. 2009). S. aureus is the number one cause of bloodstream, skin, and lower respiratory infections (Diekema et al. 2001; Goetghebeur et al. 2007; Plata et al. 2009), and multiantibiotic resistances common to HA staphylococci are now increasingly present in the community strains (Lindsay and Holden 2006; McDougal et al. 2010; Navarro et al. 2008). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS; e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis) are also a major cause of HA bloodstream infections, and oxacillin resistance and methicillin resistance are found in over 70% of strains (Diekema et al. 2001). Analyses of S. aureus complete genomes revealed that most virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes are carried on mobile genetic elements (MGE) (Baba et al. 2002; Feng et al. 2008; Highlander et al. 2007; Holden et al. 2004; Omoe et al. 2003) such as pathogenicity islands, chromosomal cassettes, transposable elements, bacteriophages, and plasmids (Lindsay and Holden 2004, 2006; Lindsay 2010; Malachowa and Deleo 2010; Novick 2003). Thus, understanding the MGEs in staphylococci is critical to controlling dissemination of these virulence factors that markedly increase the hazard of these pathogens. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains has shown that outbreaks are caused by relatively few clonal complexes or by strains with closely related genotypes (Diekema et al. 2001; Enright et al. 2002; Feil et al. 2003; Feil and Enright 2004; Feng et al. 2008; Highlander et al. 2007; Lindsay and Holden 2004, 2006). The success of these clonal complexes as pathogens may partially be explained by their enhanced ability to receive MGEs by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Type I (Sung and Lindsay 2007; Waldron and Lindsay 2006) and type III\xe2\x80\x93like (Corvaglia et al. 2010) restriction modification systems in S. aureus provide natural barriers to HGT. Strains with defective restriction modification systems acquire MGEs at higher frequencies and have greater potential to become \xe2\x80\x9csuperbugs\xe2\x80\x9d by accumulating virulence factors and resistance genes (Corvaglia et al. 2010; Sung and Lindsay 2007; Waldron and Lindsay 2006). Staphylococcal plasmids carry resistances to antibiotics, metals, antiseptics, and disinfectants, as well as virulence genes, such as enterotoxins (Bayles and Iandolo 1989; Omoe et al. 2003) and exfoliative toxins (Jackson and Iandolo 1986; Yamaguchi et al. 2001). Plasmids in staphylococci may be horizontally transferred through conjugation, mobilization, and/or transduction (Apisiridej et al. 1997; Berg et al. 1998; Francia et al. 2004; Lindsay and Holden 2004; Malachowa and Deleo 2010; Smith and Thomas 2004; Udo and Grubb 2001; Varella Coelho et al. 2009). Staphylococci also carry virulence plasmids originating from Bacillus (Gill et al. 2005) and Enterococcus (Clewell et al. 1985; Noble et al. 1992; P\xc3\xa9richon and Courvalin 2009; Sung and Lindsay 2007; Weigel et al. 2003). Staphylococcal plasmids are taxonomically grouped by replication mechanism and conjugation ability: the small, usually <5 kb, rolling-circle replicating (RCR) plasmids; the larger theta-replicating plasmids, which are subdivided into the pSK41-like conjugative plasmids; and the nonconjugative antimicrobial and metal resistance plasmids (Berg et al. 1998; Firth et al. 2000; Firth and Skurray 2006; Khan 1997; Malachowa and Deleo 2010; Novick 1989). The small RCR plasmids often carry a single antibiotic resistance gene (Khan 1997) that is transferred by transducing phages, mobilized by conjugative plasmids, or can form unresolved cointegrates with conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, arising from replicative transposition by IS257 or homologous recombination between IS257 elements (Berg et al. 1998; Leelaporn et al. 1996; Smith and Thomas 2004; Varella Coelho et al. 2009). The theta-replicating nonconjugative plasmids can also be transferred by mobilization or transduction (Apisiridej et al. 1997; Francia et al. 2004; Lindsay and Holden 2006; Malachowa and Deleo 2010; Smillie et al. 2010). As of 2010, the NCBI RefSeq database had 102 complete staphylococcal plasmid sequences, but only 29 (28%) of them were >20 kb and only 15% were >30 kb and, thus, large enough to encode conjugation machinery. Of the latter group, only 6% had annotated conjugative transfer loci (McDougal et al. 2010). Conjugative plasmids spread readily among Staphylococcus strains and to and from other genera such as Enterococcus (Lindsay 2010; Malachowa and Deleo 2010; P\xc3\xa9richon and Courvalin 2009; Zhu et al. 2008), and they are implicated in spreading virulence loci and vancomycin resistance among clinical strains (P\xc3\xa9richon and Courvalin 2009; Zhu et al. 2008). Multiresistance plasmids between 20 and 30 kb are common in staphylococci from several continents (Baba et al. 2002; Bayles and Iandolo 1989; Highlander et al. 2007; Holden et al. 2004; Shalita et al. 1980; Toh et al. 2007; Zuccarelli et al. 1990). Although unlikely to be conjugative, these 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb multiresistance virulence plasmids can be transferred by mobilization or by the generalized transducing phages prevalent among S. aureus strains (Lindsay and Holden 2004, 2006; Lindsay 2010). We undertook the work reported here to identify the plasmid composition of naturally occurring isolates of staphylococci and found considerably more large plasmids than previously recorded. We used this opportunity to examine archived strains from the mid-twentieth century known to contain large plasmids. We screened 280 strains of staphylococci collected from 1946 to 2007 in diverse geographical regions to determine the number, size, and restriction type of plasmids they carried (aka the plasmid profile of each strain). We chose 100 strains containing distinct plasmids >20 kb for sequencing to increase the representation of large staphylococcal plasmid sequences available. The 93 complete new plasmid sequences included 59 plasmids >20 kb, tripling the number of large staphylococcal plasmid sequences in RefSeq. We also acquired 57 partial plasmid and phage sequences.'","b""Staphylococci are increasingly aggressive human pathogens suggesting that active evolution is spreading novel virulence and resistance phenotypes.

The small RCR plasmids often carry a single antibiotic resistance gene (Khan 1997) that is transferred by transducing phages, mobilized by conjugative plasmids, or can form unresolved cointegrates with conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, arising from replicative transposition by IS257 or homologous recombination between IS257 elements (Berg et al. 1998; Leelaporn et al. 1996; Smith and Thomas 2004; Varella Coelho et al. 2009). The theta-replicating nonconjugative plasmids can also be transferred by mobilization or transduction (Apisiridej et al. 1997; Francia et al. 2004; Lindsay and Holden 2006; Malachowa and Deleo 2010; Smillie et al. 2010). As of 2010, the NCBI RefSeq database had 102 complete staphylococcal plasmid sequences, but only 29 (28%) of them were >20 kb and only 15% were >30 kb and, thus, large enough to encode conjugation machinery. Of the latter group, only 6% had annotated conjugative transfer loci (McDougal et al. 2010). Conjugative plasmids spread readily among Staphylococcus strains and to and from other genera such as Enterococcus (Lindsay 2010; Malachowa and Deleo 2010; P\xc3\xa9richon and Courvalin 2009; Zhu et al. 2008), and they are implicated in spreading virulence loci and vancomycin resistance among clinical strains (P\xc3\xa9richon and Courvalin 2009; Zhu et al. 2008). Multiresistance plasmids between 20 and 30 kb are common in staphylococci from several continents (Baba et al. 2002; Bayles and Iandolo 1989; Highlander et al. 2007; Holden et al. 2004; Shalita et al. 1980; Toh et al. 2007; Zuccarelli et al. 1990). Although unlikely to be conjugative, these 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb multiresistance virulence plasmids can be transferred by mobilization or by the generalized transducing phages prevalent among S. aureus strains (Lindsay and Holden 2004, 2006; Lindsay 2010). We undertook the work reported here to identify the plasmid composition of naturally occurring isolates of staphylococci and found considerably more large plasmids than previously recorded. We used this opportunity to examine archived strains from the mid-twentieth century known to contain large plasmids. We screened 280 strains of staphylococci collected from 1946 to 2007 in diverse geographical regions to determine the number, size, and restriction type of plasmids they carried (aka the plasmid profile of each strain). We chose 100 strains containing distinct plasmids >20 kb for sequencing to increase the representation of large staphylococcal plasmid sequences available. The 93 complete new plasmid sequences included 59 plasmids >20 kb, tripling the number of large staphylococcal plasmid sequences in RefSeq. We also acquired 57 partial plasmid and phage sequences. We screened 280 strains of staphylococci from eight geographically and epidemiologically distinct collections (supporting information, Table S1), including 251 S. aureus, 14 S. epidermidis, 3 S. lentus, 2 S. pseudintermedius, 2 S. schleiferi, and 8 CNS of unspecified species. In addition, we sequenced plasmid DNA from strain CM05, a human clinical isolate from Columbia (Toh et al. 2007) and from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strain 5753c (McDougal et al. 2010). Strains were grown in BHI broth without shaking at 37\xc2\xb0 for 18\xe2\x80\x9324 hr. Total plasmid DNA was isolated from 1 to 5 ml of culture with the CosMC Prep Kit (Agencourt Biosciences Corp., Beverly, MA), as described (Williams et al. 2006). Cell pellets were suspended in 100 \xce\xbcl RE1 buffer containing 200 \xce\xbcg/ml lysostaphin and 6% PEG (MW 8000) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature before proceeding with the CosMC Prep Kit protocol. CosMC Kit preparations were done in duplicate, and pooled plasmid DNA was electrophoresed using 0.5% SeaKem Gold agarose (Cambrex BioScience, Walkersville, MD) 16 cm gels in 1X TAE (40 mM Tris-acetate, 2 mM Na2EDTA\xe2\x80\x932H2O) for 15\xe2\x80\x9318 hr at 30\xe2\x80\x9335 V and stained with Sybr Green I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmid band sizes were estimated by BacTracker supercoiled DNA ladder (Epicentre, Madison, WI). DNA preparations found initially to have high sheared DNA background were in subsequent preparations treated with lambda exonuclease and RecJf (New England Biolabs) (Balagurumoorthy et al. 2008) and/or Plasmid-safe DNase (Epicentre) prior to electrophoresis. Sixteen plasmids were further purified by electroelution (Williams et al. 2006) into 1X TAE followed by TE dialysis. Three plasmids were prepared by QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) or Qiagen Midi Kit (Enterococcus faecium 5753c), and one plasmid (pCM05) was prepared by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. Plasmid bands were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and plasmids were assigned a restriction type (RT) according to their AccI RFLP pattern; a unique RT number was given to each unique pattern. In-slice restriction digests were performed on gel slices containing individual plasmid bands excised with a razor blade. Gel slices were rocked at 4\xc2\xb0 for 30 min in 1 ml TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8), transferred to 100 \xce\xbcl 1X restriction buffer (New England Biolabs), rocked at 4\xc2\xb0 for 30 min to 1 hr, transferred to 100 \xce\xbcl fresh 1X restriction buffer with 15\xe2\x80\x9320 units enzyme, and then incubated at 37\xc2\xb0, 50\xe2\x80\x9375 rpm for 16\xe2\x80\x9324 hr. Digested gel slices were transferred to 1 ml 1X TBE and rocked at 4\xc2\xb0 for 30\xe2\x80\x9360 min, sealed with molten agarose into a well of a 16 cm 1.5% agarose gel (medium EEO) (Sigma, Inc., St. Louis, MO), and electrophoresed in 1X TBE for 15\xe2\x80\x9318 hr at 30\xe2\x80\x9335 V. Gels were stained with Sybr Green I (Invitrogen). RFLP patterns with several enzymes guided the choice of those for sequencing and subsequently tested the accuracy of the sequence assemblies. Plasmid DNA was sequenced according to standard high-throughput Sanger protocols at the J. Craig Venter Institute, and data was assembled using the Celera Assembler (Myers et al. 2000). Quality control inspections included coverage analysis, BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (Zhang et al. 2000) of contigs >2000 bases, and visual inspection of mate pairing and scaffolding using Hawkeye (Schatz et al. 2007). Chromosomal and/or other contamination were filtered based on perfect BLAST hits to S. aureus and S. epidermidis references. DNA samples for each strain were assigned a unique SAP (S. aureus plasmids) project number. To distinguish multiple plasmids in the same strain, each was assigned the strain SAP number plus A, B, C, or D, starting with complete (closed) plasmid sequences in descending size, followed by partial sequences (Table S2). Gene calling and annotations were done by P-RAST (http://cgat.mcs.anl.gov/plasmid-rast-dev/FIG/prast.cgi) and/or RAST (http://rast.nmpdr.org) (Aziz et al. 2008), which uses mobile element gene names from the ACLAME database (http://aclame.ulb.ac.be) (Leplae et al. 2004). Lasergene (DNAstar, Madison, WI) and Gene Construction Kit (Textco Biosoftware, West Lebanon, NH) were used to display sequences and predict restriction sites. Sequence alignments were done with Megalign (DNAstar) using ClustalW and/or with BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (Zhang et al. 2000), and plasmid genome alignments were done using Mauve (Darling et al. 2004). One hundred fifty complete and partial plasmid and phage sequences were submitted to GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (Table S2). Partial sequences are those with one or more gaps in the sequence, including plasmid and phage fragments (Table S2). Partial sequences with the same plasmid name are fragments of the same plasmid (Table S2). We screened 280 staphylococci, 247 of which had not previously been examined for plasmid content. Ninety percent of strains had plasmids, and 78.5% of these had one or more large plasmids >20 kb (Table S3). Of the 184 typable >20 kb plasmids in these newly screened strains, 75% were 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb (Table 1). Indeed, plasmids from 20 to 30 kb are extremely abundant among staphylococci, but they were only 13.7% of previously sequenced staphylococcal plasmids in RefSeq. Restriction types (RT) were assigned by RFLP analysis (see Materials and Methods), and three RTs (RT1, RT2, and RT3) encompassed 60.7% of typable 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb plasmids in strains not previously examined for plasmids (Table 2). These three RTs were also 42.5% of all large plasmids >20 kb typed and 49.0% of those from newly examined strains (Table 2). We assigned 106 distinct RTs, and 80% of those were unique to a single plasmid; thus, only those three RTs were widely common. The RT1 family has the smallest plasmids of the three common groups, estimated by gels at 18\xe2\x80\x9321 kb (Table 2), resembling previously sequenced pMW2 (Baba et al. 2002) and pSAS (Holden et al. 2004) of a U.S. MRSA strain and a U.K. MSSA strain, respectively. The RFLPs of 25\xe2\x80\x9327 kb RT2 family resembled many previously unsequenced or partially sequenced plasmids, including 54 plasmids in California MRSA hospital strains isolated in the 1980s (Zuccarelli et al. 1990); plasmid pIB485 carrying the sed enterotoxin gene (Bayles and Iandolo 1989); and 8 pIB485-like S. aureus plasmids carrying ser and sej enterotoxin genes (Omoe et al. 2003). The RT3 plasmids also ranged from 25 to 27 kb (Table 2), but the RT3 restriction pattern resembled that of previously sequenced plasmid pUSA300HOUMR (NC_010063) (Highlander et al. 2007). Six pMW2-like RT1, 5 pIB485-like RT2, and 3 pUSA300HOUMR-like RT3 plasmids from diverse epidemiological and geographical backgrounds were chosen for sequencing, along with 86 plasmids with less common or unique RTs. Prior to submission of the sequences from this project, only 29 of the 102 complete staphylococcal plasmid sequences in RefSeq were larger than 20 kb (28%) (Table 3). The 93 new complete staphylococcal plasmid sequences (Table 3 and Table S2) increased the number of large >30 kb plasmids from 15 to 42, the number of 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb plasmids from 14 to 46, and the number of small <20 kb plasmids from 73 to 107. Thus, 45% of staphylococcal complete plasmid sequences are now >20 kb, which more closely represents the plasmid content observed in the 247 newly examined staphylococcal strains (Table S3). For the partial plasmid sequences that were deposited, 16 are plasmids with one small gap (\xe2\x88\xbc20 bp), and the other 41 are large plasmid or phage contigs (1.4\xe2\x80\x9356.7 kb) (Table S2). As expected (Malachowa and Deleo 2010; Novick 2003), the plasmids carry multiple antibiotic resistance genes and virulence genes, such as enterotoxins and exfoliative toxins (Table S2), including three new enterotoxins. Plasmid maintenance and transmissibility genes and transposons were also identified (Table S2). A RepA_N-type replication initiation gene (Weaver et al. 2009) occurs in 90% (54) of the 60 completely sequenced staphylococcal plasmids >10 kb [excepting the phage GQ900400, p5753cA GQ900435 from E. faecium and potential integrative conjugative element (ICE) GQ900429, Table S2]. The remaining 6, corresponding to pMW2-like RT1 plasmids, have only remnants of a RepA_N-type gene but contain a member of the Rep_3 superfamily first identified in the S. epidermidis plasmid pSK639 (Apisiridej et al. 1997; Firth and Skurray 2006). As further evidence of replicon fusions, 11 of 54 plasmids carrying a RepA_N-type gene also have a pSK639-like rep gene or a remnant thereof (Table S2). All 60 plasmids >10 kb encode some partitioning function: 78% have a homolog of the pSK1 par locus (Simpson et al. 2003), 12% have a type Ib partitioning system, and 10% have a type II system (Table S2). Among plasmids large enough to encode conjugation loci (>12 kb) (Berg et al. 1998; Caryl and O'Neill 2009), only 6 of the 27 closed >30 kb plasmids have a clearly annotated conjugative transfer region, doubling the conjugation loci sequences available in RefSeq. An additional complete tra region was found in partial sequence SAP015B [GQ900500] (Table S2). Only 17 plasmids from this project (Table 4) have predicted mob loci (13 closed and 4 partial sequences), with only 3 from S. aureus (Table S2). An additional 31 plasmids (Table 4 and Table S2) encode a potential relaxase, tra or pre, which could function in mobilization (Francia et al. 2004; Garcillan-Barcia et al. 2009; Smith and Thomas 2004; Varella Coelho et al. 2009), for a total of 48 plasmids with putative mobilization genes. Palindromic sequences in the recognition (res) sites, used by resolvases to separate plasmid multimers and thereby promote segregational stability, are also hotspots for insertion of Tn552 and other transposons (Derbise et al. 1995; Lebard et al. 2008; Paulsen et al. 1994; Rowland and Dyke 1989, 1990). Such res sites are adjacent to plasmid resolvase sin genes in nonconjugative multiresistance plasmids and to res in the pSK41-like conjugative plasmids (Berg et al. 1998; Lebard et al. 2008; Rowland et al. 2002). Insertion of Tn552-, Tn4002-, or Tn5404-like transposons at these recombination hotspots produces a region of DNA flanked by inverted repeats (resL and resR) that can be inverted by the Bin recombinase (Derbise et al. 1995; Rowland and Dyke 1989, 1990; Rowland et al. 2002). This continual flipping process results in a region of sequence heterogeneity, complicating plasmid sequence assembly. The common occurrence of transposable elements such as Tn552 and IS257 and recombinases Bin, Sin, and Res (Table 5 and Table S2) likely explains several of the 57 partial and gapped plasmid sequences we obtained. Forty-four complete staphylococcal plasmid sequences and 32 partial sequences carry the sin gene (Table 5). The sin gene occurs in 47% (44 of 93, Table 5) of staphylococcal plasmids completely sequenced in this project. sin, almost exclusively found on plasmids (where it is sometimes annotated as bin3), is not associated with a transposable element (Paulsen et al. 1994; Rowland and Dyke 1989; Rowland et al. 2002). A resolvase/invertase site-specific recombinase family member, sin most resembles Gram-positive resolvases like Res from Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM\xce\xb21 (Paulsen et al. 1994; Swinfield et al. 1991), which reduce multimers to ensure plasmid inheritance. sin may play this role for staphylococcal plasmids (Paulsen et al. 1994; Rowland et al. 2002). As expected (Berg et al. 1998; Lebard et al. 2008; Rowland et al. 2002), sin occurred on plasmids lacking tra genes, and res was found on the pSK41-like plasmids encoding conjugation genes, with only one exception: res also occurred on the mobilizable plasmid SAP016A from a S. epidermidis strain (Table S2). The same 75 bp internal deletion is in sin in 5 of the pMW2-like plasmids, and 8 newly sequenced S. aureus plasmids (4 complete sequences and 4 partial sequences) have truncated sin genes. Of the 60 complete staphylococcal plasmids >10 kb (Table S2) likely to require a resolvase, 51 or 85% have sin or res. Only 16 RefSeq plasmid sequences carry sin and only 7 have res (Table 5); in total, 74 of 195 (37.9%) complete staphylococcal plasmid sequences have a sin or res recombinase gene, presumably to enable stable plasmid inheritance. Besides sin, the single most common gene in the staphylococcal plasmids is bin, mostly found with the \xce\xb2-lactamase genes blaZ, blaR1, and blaI of the replicative transposon Tn552 as the transposon\xe2\x80\x99s resolvase. Of the plasmids >20 kb in size that we sequenced, 68 (68.7%) carry at least one bin (Table 5 and Table S2). Tn552, including bin, is also found on staphylococcal chromosomes (Rowland and Dyke 1989; Rowland and Dyke 1990). Full or truncated Tn552 occurs on 53 complete staphylococcal plasmids (18 in RefSeq and 35 from this project, Table 5), isolated from strains found in Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Columbia from the 1940s to the 2000s (Table S2), demonstrating intercontinental plasmid-mediated spread of antibiotic resistances and their persistence over six decades. We found the full Tn552 located on 10 complete and 7 partial staphylococcal plasmids, and we found that 25 complete and 15 partial plasmids encode one of two truncated Tn552 variants (Table 5). Tn552 encodes two transposition genes, p271 and p480, the resolvase bin, and the \xce\xb2-lactamase genes blaI, blaR1, and blaZ, and it generates 6 bp direct repeats of target DNA flanking its \xe2\x88\xbc120 bp inverted repeats (Rowland and Dyke 1989, 1990). The full or truncated variants of Tn552 (Figure 1) occur in 38% (57 of 150) of the new complete and partial staphylococcal plasmid sequences but in only 18% of those in RefSeq (Table 5). Tn552 insertion adjacent to transposons, within other transposons, or near res sites can create DNA segments that can then be inverted or deleted by Bin (Rowland and Dyke 1989, 1990). The prototypical \xce\x94Tn552 in pI258 likely arose by Bin-mediated deletion (Rowland and Dyke 1990). In pI258, \xce\x94Tn552 lacks transposition genes but has bin and all three \xce\xb2-lactamase\xe2\x80\x93associated genes (Figure 1). Twenty-three complete and 12 partial newly sequenced staphylococcal plasmids, including pI258, have \xce\x94Tn552; only four examples of \xce\x94Tn552 are in RefSeq. We first observed here the converse truncated version of Tn552, Tn552\xce\x94, which has the transposase genes and bin but lacks the bla genes (Figure 1). Tn552\xce\x94 was only observed in 2 complete and 3 partial staphylococcal plasmids (Table 5). Dominant variants of Tn552 found on Staphylococcus plasmids. The full-length Tn552 is characterized by two transposase genes, p271 and p480, a bin recombinase, and three \xce\xb2-lactamase\xe2\x80\x93associated genes, blaI, blaR1, and blaZ. Tn552\xce\x94 is missing the bla genes, and \xce\x94Tn552 is missing the transposase genes. At 26% of 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb newly profiled plasmids, the pIB485-like RT2 plasmids are the most prevalent of the three major RTs identified by RFLP profiling (Table 2). No pIB485-like plasmid had been completely sequenced before this project, but 63 plasmids with a similar RFLP had been reported (see above) (Bayles and Iandolo 1989; Omoe et al. 2003; Zuccarelli et al. 1990), including the SED enterotoxin\xe2\x80\x93containing plasmid pIB485 (Bayles and Iandolo 1989). The five strains whose plasmids we sequenced were isolated between 1949 and 2001 (Table 6) in the United States (2), the United Kingdom (1), and Australia (2), and they have \xce\x94Tn552 (Figure 1) similar to that of pI258. Over 99% identical (Table 6), these five plasmids clearly demonstrate geographic spread and stability in terms of gene sequence and organization over five decades. A sixth otherwise identical plasmid, SAP060A, from a pre-1960 US isolate, lacks \xce\x94Tn552 (Figure 2A) but is otherwise 99.97% identical to SAP012A (Table 6), a pIB485-like plasmid isolated from a 1995 US MRSA strain. In the other five pIB485-like plasmids, a 10 bp direct repeat of plasmid DNA flanks the \xce\x94Tn552 segment (Figure 2B), suggesting it was inserted by transposition; this same 10 bp also occurs as an inverted repeat in the predicted sin res site (Rowland et al. 2002). Thus, SAP060A has two copies of the 10 bp sequence in an inverted repeat, and the 5 other pIB485-like plasmids have three copies of the 10 bp sequence, two in direct repeat flanking \xce\x94Tn552 and the third on the opposite strand (Figure 2B). pIB485-like enterotoxin plasmids with or without \xce\x94Tn552. (A) Diagram of pIB485-like plasmid SAP060A (open reading frames in gray), positions 2210\xe2\x80\x938928, showing the insert position of the 4278 bp \xce\x94Tn552 (hatched) in the sin res site (Rowland et al. 2002) in the other pIB485-like plasmids (Table 6). The \xce\x94Tn552 (hatched) insert has flanking 10 bp direct repeats (right-facing gray arrowheads) of res site DNA, likely resulting from transposition. An inverted repeat of that same 10 bp insertion site is also present upstream from sin, as part of the predicted res site (left-facing gray arrowhead). The black arrows show predicted open reading frames. (B) The sequence details of the \xce\x94Tn552 inserted in the sin res site. The sequence without the insertion is SAP060A positions 2454\xe2\x80\x932528. The other pIB485-like plasmid sequences contain \xce\x94Tn552, and the nucleotides shown are identical in all. The gray arrows show the 10 bp direct and inverted repeats. In addition to \xce\x94Tn552, all pIB485-like plasmids, including SAP060A, carry the cluster of Staphylococcus enterotoxin genes sed, sej, and ser previously reported in this plasmid family (Bayles and Iandolo 1989; Omoe et al. 2003) that have contributed to several outbreaks of S. aureus food-borne illness (Omoe et al. 2003; Ono et al. 2008; Plata et al. 2009). The SAP012A and SAP060A sequences have a frameshift in sed due to a missing T in a run of eight Ts. This may be an occurrence of a common sequencing error (Li and California 2006), as only those two sequences have the sed frameshift; the question can be resolved by testing for the presence of the relevant gene transcript or product. The pIB485-like plasmids also carry cadmium resistance genes cadX and cadD. Energy-dependent Cd(II) efflux was first described by Tynecka (Tynecka et al. 1981a, 1981b) with pII147 and later in several staphylococcal plasmids, including pI258 (Crupper et al. 1999; Massidda et al. 2006; Nies 1992; Nucifora et al. 1989). Like the pIB485-like plasmids, the pMW2-like RT1 plasmids are common (Table 2) with a wide geographical distribution, composing \xe2\x88\xbc20% (27 of 138) of the 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb plasmids and coming from US, UK, and Australian S. aureus strains between 1995 and 2004 (Table 7). Only three pMW2-like plasmids (pMW2, pSAS, and p21) were available in RefSeq when we sequenced the six described here. All pMW2-like plasmids are 99% identical (Table 7), differing mainly by a 75 bp deletion in sin only in pMW2, pSAS, SAP053A, SAP072A, and pWBG750 (Figure 3A). SAP072A, from the most recently isolated S. aureus strain (2004 UK), was from an animal isolate (Table 7); thus, these plasmids are not limited to human strains. SAP072A is 99.99% identical to pMW2, a plasmid from a 1998 US human CA-MRSA clinical isolate (Baba et al. 2002). pMW2-like plasmids with full-length Tn552. (A) Diagram of the pMW2 sequence positions 2407\xe2\x80\x9312018, including the complete Tn552 with flanking 10 bp direct repeats (gray arrowheads). All pMW2-like plasmids (Table 7) have a frameshift that truncates the p480 transposase and generates a second putative ORF. pMW2 and the four plasmids listed have a 75 bp deletion in sin; the four remaining pMW2-like plasmids have the full sin gene. (B) The pMW2 sequence that flanks Tn552, positions 4831\xe2\x80\x9311469. Tn552 (6553 bp, including the 10 bp DR) is inserted into the putative sin res site; res siteI and res siteII predicted for p21 (Rowland et al. 2002) are labeled (black arrows). This sequence is identical in all pMW2-like plasmids. The gray arrows show the 10 bp direct repeats. The pMW2-like RT1 plasmids are the smallest (20.7 kb) of the prevalent RT groups (Table 7). They carry putative bacteriocin and bacteriocin-immunity genes and several short ORFs annotated as pre, indicating possible mobilizability (Francia et al. 2004; Garcillan-Barcia et al. 2009; Smith and Thomas 2004; Varella Coelho et al. 2009). As with the pIB485-like plasmids, the pMW2-like plasmids carry cadmium resistance (cadD, cadX) and have a full Tn552 in the sin res site predicted for p21 (Rowland et al. 2002) (Figure 3, A and B). All pMW2-like plasmids contain a frameshift mutation in the Tn552 transposase p480, fragmenting it into two separate, overlapping predicted open reading frames (Figure 3A), both of which encode putative transposases, unlike the prototypical Tn552 of pI9789 where p480 is a single gene (Rowland and Dyke 1989, 1990). Like the \xce\x94Tn552 in the pIB485-like plasmids (Figure 2, A and B), the full Tn552 in the RT1 plasmids is flanked by 10 bp direct repeats of plasmid DNA (Figure 3B). Although no pMW2-like plasmids lacking Tn552 have been reported, such a plasmid (14.1 kb) would be much smaller than the >20 kb plasmids we focused on because the Tn552 insert is 6553 bp. The pUSA300HOUMR-like RT3 plasmids are the third common plasmid group identified by RFLP analysis and, like the pMW2-like plasmids, comprised \xe2\x88\xbc20% of the 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb plasmids we typed (Table 2). Unlike the geographically diverse pIB485-like and pMW2-like plasmids, they were found only in US S. aureus isolates (Table 8). However, like the pMW2-like plasmids, the pUSA300HOUMR-like RT3 plasmids occurred in both animal and human strains. The three plasmids identified as RT3 by RFLP analysis are 99.8\xe2\x80\x9399.9% identical at the sequence level (Table 8) to plasmid pUSA300HOUMR from a human clinical MRSA isolated in Houston, TX (Highlander et al. 2007). Four other pUSA300HOUMR-like plasmids were identified by sequencing to have >98% identity with pUSA300HOUMR, apart from insertions and deletions (Table 8). All pUSA300HOUMR-like plasmids carry a \xce\x94Tn552 (bin, blaI, blaR1, blaZ) (Figure 4) similar to pI258 and the pIB485-like RT2 plasmids, but it is not flanked by 10 bp repeats or located within the truncated sin res site. Lacking the Tn552 transposases, the pUSA300HOUMR-like plasmids have a transposase similar to that carried by IS257 and IS431mec, three copies of which are found in these plasmids. A deletion event like that described for pI258 (Rowland and Dyke 1990) may have removed the Tn552 transposases adjacent to bin. Multiresistant pUSA300HOUMR-like plasmids with a \xce\x94Tn552 that lacks flanking direct repeats. Diagram of the pUSA300HOUMR-like plasmid SAP050A, positions 25986 through the end of the sequence (27067) and positions 1 to 17050, showing insertions and deletions for the other pUSA300HOUMR-like plasmids (Table 8). The \xce\x94Tn552 genes are hatched; all other predicted genes are gray. SAP027A has a 923 bp region of high mismatch (to positions 25058\xe2\x80\x9325980) and a 2507 bp insertion just prior to the illustrated sequence that includes a predicted antiseptic resistance protein. SAP052A has a 5767 bp insertion after position 11570 that includes a predicted multidrug efflux protein. SAP051A does not encode bacitracin resistance genes (deleted positions 3654\xe2\x80\x937693). The SAP049A 2047 bp deletion is not shown (positions 19771\xe2\x80\x9321817) and includes three hypothetical genes upstream of cadX. Besides the \xce\xb2-lactamase and cadmium resistances carried by the pIB485-like and pMW2-like plasmids, the pUSA300HOUMR-like plasmids also encode macrolide and aminoglycoside resistances, and all but SAP015A carry bacitracin resistance (Figure 4). SAP027A has an insertion encoding antiseptic resistance, and SAP053A has an additional predicted multidrug efflux protein (F",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gure 4). The four non-RT3 pUSA300HOUMR-like plasmids identified by sequencing, because insertions and/or deletions gave them different RFLP profiles, show how easily these plasmids may gain even more resistance genes. Eight additional plasmids belonging to this family were recently sequenced from clinical S. aureus USA300 isolates from multiple locations in the United States (Kennedy et al. 2010). The prevalence of 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb plasmids, almost half of which belong to only three restriction types by RFLP analysis, in staphylococci isolated from sources very distant in time and space suggests that these nonconjugative plasmids are surprisingly widespread for non\xe2\x80\x93self-mobile plasmids. Plasmids in this size range can potentially be transferred by transducing phages (Lindsay and Holden 2006; Malachowa and Deleo 2010; Smillie et al. 2010); most phage genomes identified in staphylococci are >40 kb, and transduction is thought to be restricted by phage genome size (Smillie et al. 2010). More of these 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb plasmids may be mobilizable than is apparent with current genome data if they contain mob genes not yet identified as such. However, the scarcity of conjugative plasmids (only 12 in total) implies that mobilization is rare and that staphylococcal plasmid transfer occurs mainly by transduction (Lindsay and Holden 2004; Lindsay 2010). The now larger dataset makes the mechanism of intercellular movement of these strongly peripatetic 20\xe2\x80\x9330 kb plasmids ripe for examination. Serine recombinases important for many mobile elements are prevalent in staphylococci (Rowland et al. 2002), playing roles in stable plasmid inheritance and transposon movement. Sin recombinase may have a role in plasmid multimer resolution (Rowland et al. 2002) in 47% of staphylococcal plasmids completely sequenced in this project and in 31% of all complete sequences, including those in RefSeq. Other serine recombinases are associated with the movement of antibiotic resistances, such as transposition of vancomycin resistance genes on Tn1546 (Katayama et al. 2000) and the \xce\xb2-lactamase genes carried on Tn552 whose movement is associated with bin. In addition to being the Tn552 resolvase, bin is commonly found on large staphylococcal plasmids and may play a role in deletions and rearrangements (Murphy and Novick 1980; Rowland and Dyke 1989, 1990). The \xce\xb2-lactamase\xe2\x80\x93encoding transposon Tn552 in plasmids of staphylococci isolated between the 1940s and the 2000s from distant locations shows the persistence of antibiotic resistance genes over time and geography. All three major families we observed carried \xce\xb2-lactamase genes associated with partial or full Tn552 and with cadmium resistance genes. Virtually identical pIB485-like plasmids with (or without) a \xce\x94Tn552 and carrying three enterotoxin genes (Figure 2A) occurred in strains from distant locations isolated 50 years apart. Our work markedly expands and enriches the evidence that plasmids have retained and gained gene content as they spread across the globe among epidemiologically and geographically diverse S. aureus strains. Sequence alignments revealed four pUSA300HOUMR-like plasmids not identified as such by RFLP analysis, emphasizing the spread of this family among US S. aureus strains and showing they are even more abundant than detectable by plasmid profiling (Table 2). The pUSA300HOUMR-like plasmids all carry multiple antimicrobial resistances, and two of them, SAP027A and SAP052A, have insertions with additional resistance genes (Figure 4). These plasmids are a snapshot of how easily resistance genes are gained and spread among pathogenic staphylococci. The pUSA300HOUMR-like group of plasmids was found only in S. aureus strains isolated in the United States, unlike the other two major families, but it is likely that these plasmids will spread worldwide as have the pMW2-like and pIB485-like plasmids. The three major families identified show that these plasmids are persistent and widespread on a global scale. The sequenced pMW2-like (Table 7) and pIB485-like (Table 6) plasmids were from strains isolated on three continents, and the latter group's strains were isolated decades apart (Table 6). The pMW2-like and pUSA300HOUMR-like plasmids came from both human and animal isolates, reemphasizing (Lindsay 2010) that properly assessing the spread of S. aureus strains and their mobile elements requires study of both animal and human strains to determine whether human strains are infecting animals or whether strains are simply sharing mobile elements. In summary, we aimed to increase the number of large staphylococcal plasmid sequences to better assess the global and temporal diversity and spread of these mobile elements. We have tripled the number of large plasmid sequences available and identified three major plasmid families and the most common genes found on large plasmids, opening several key areas for future investigation. The phylogeny of the plasmids should be examined, but their varying sizes and the large number and variety of their transposable elements challenges classical cladistics approaches. These plasmids also carry several classes of genes providing clues to their ecology within the worldwide population of staphylococci. The abundance of arsenic, mercury, and cadmium resistances suggests that nonantibiotic environmental toxicants foster persistence of these multiresistant mobile elements. Arsenic is widely used in animal agriculture (Jackson and Bertsch 2001; Rutherford et al. 2003), approximately 30% of the US population is directly exposed to mercury via dental amalgam restorations (Richardson et al. 2011), and cadmium exposure can be occupational (Cespon-Romero and Yebra-Biurrun 2007; Wang et al. 2008) or from tobacco use (Butler Walker et al. 2006). There are several enterotoxins, exfoliative toxins, and pls (antiadhesion to nasal epithelial cells) (Savolainen et al. 2001), as well as predicted bacteriocins/lantibiotic genes and a very common predicted abiK gene (Table S2) that may have antibacterial or antiviral effects, any or all of which might be involved in the equilibrium between being a benign commensal or life-threatening pathogen. The mechanism of spread of these plasmids, including the potential for mobilization, especially of those shared among animal and human strains, is particularly important to elucidate.

The selection of BAC clones for construction of the physical map was carried out by screening gridded BAC libraries with DNA overgo probes derived from both genetically mapped DNA markers flanking the locus of interest and BAC-end sequences that align to Arabidopsis thaliana sequences within the previously identified syntenic region. The selected BAC clones consistently mapped to three different genomic regions of B. oleracea. Although 83 BAC clones were accurately mapped within a \xe2\x88\xbc4.6 cM region surrounding the downy mildew resistance locus Pp523, a subset of 33 BAC clones mapped to another region on chromosome C8 that was \xe2\x88\xbc60 cM away from the resistance gene, and a subset of 63 BAC clones mapped to chromosome C5. These results reflect the triplication of the Brassica genomes since their divergence from a common ancestor shared with A. thaliana, and they are consonant with recent analyses of the C genome of Brassica napus. The assembly of a minimal tiling path constituted by 13 (BoT01) BAC clones that span the Pp523 locus sets the stage for map-based cloning of this resistance gene.Downy mildew caused by the oomycete Hyaloperonospora brassicae (G\xc3\xa4um.) (G\xc3\xb6ker et al. 2003) affects Brassica oleracea L. plants from seedlings in nurseries to adult plants in the field, reducing yield and severely compromising the quality of the marketable product. For some specific genotypes and environmental conditions, such as the Romanesco-type cauliflower in Brittany, losses due to this disease can even be total (Monot et al. 2010). One of the most effective, low-cost, and ecologically benign methods for plant disease control is the use of genetically resistant plants. For downy mildew, several sources of genetic resistance have been identified at seedling and adult plant stages of B. oleracea (Natti and Atkin 1960; Natti el al. 1967; Dickson and Petzoldt 1993; Hoser-Krauze et al. 1995; Mahajan et al. 1995; Coelho et al. 1998; Jensen et al. 1999). However, resistance to downy mildew in these two plant developmental stages is apparently determined by different genetic systems: plants that exhibit resistance at the cotyledonary phase can be susceptible at the adult phase and vice versa (Monteiro et al. 2005). During the last few years, there were some advances in the genetic study of the inheritance of downy mildew resistance and in the isolation and cloning of resistance genes in Brassica species. One locus conferring downy mildew resistance at the cotyledon stage in broccoli (Brassica oleracea convar. italica) was genetically mapped by Giovannelli et al. (2002) and located in close linkage to the glucosinolate pathway gene BoGsl-elong on a dense map of B. oleracea (Gao et al. 2007). A second downy mildew resistance gene at seedling stage was recently mapped in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) (Yu et al. 2009). A dominant and monogenically inherited resistance locus expressed at the adult plant stage was identified in broccoli by Coelho et al. (1998) and named Pp523 (after a pathogen strain). This locus was later located on a new genetic map of RAPD and AFLP markers (Farinh\xc3\xb3 et al. 2004) within a linkage group assigned to the B. oleracea chromosome C8 (Carlier et al. 2011). Five DNA markers that defined a genomic region of 8.5 cM encompassing this resistance locus were then cloned, sequenced, and remapped as SCAR and CAPS markers. BLAST queries (www.ncbi.nihl.gov/blast) identified a genomic region syntenic to this B. oleracea genome segment at the extremity of the top arm of Arabidopsis thaliana L. chromosome 1 (Farinh\xc3\xb3 et al. 2007). Map-based, or positional, cloning, is a common strategy for isolation of genes responsible for phenotypic differences. This strategy was used for the isolation of most of the >100 reference R-Genes so far included in the Plant Resistance Genes database (http://prgdb.cbm.fvg.it; Sanseverino et al. 2010). Map-based cloning, with specific variations, was also the central procedure used for the isolation of the A. thaliana genes RPP5 (Parker et al. 1997), RPP8 (McDowell et al. 1998), RPP1 (Botella et al., 1998), RPP4 (Van Der Biezen et al. 2002), and RPP2A/RPP2B (Sinapidou et al. 2004), the single downy mildew resistance genes so far isolated in the Brassicaceae family. One of the major steps in map-based cloning is the physical identification of the genomic region where the gene is located. For genomes still not fully sequenced, this implies the physical mapping of the gene of interest via construction of a contig of large insert DNA clones, usually BACs. Here we report the construction of a physical map of a genomic region of 2.9 cM that encompasses the downy mildew resistance locus Pp523 in B. oleracea, carried out by exploiting the conserved synteny between B. oleracea and A. thaliana (Farinh\xc3\xb3 et al. 2007). One major obstacle to overcome was the triplicated nature of B. oleracea genome (O\xe2\x80\x99Neill and Bancroft 2000; Lysak et al. 2005; Town et al. 2006).'","b'We describe the construction of a BAC contig and identification of a minimal tiling path that encompass the dominant and monogenically inherited downy mildew resistance locus Pp523 of Brassica oleracea L.

One major obstacle to overcome was the triplicated nature of B. oleracea genome (O\xe2\x80\x99Neill and Bancroft 2000; Lysak et al. 2005; Town et al. 2006). The B. oleracea mapping population (163 F2 plants), the evaluation of plant response to downy mildew, and the procedures for plant DNA extraction and molecular marker analyses have been previously described (Coelho and Monteiro 2003; Farinh\xc3\xb3 et al. 2004, 2007). Two gridded B. oleracea BAC libraries (BoT01 and BoCig) constructed at the Plant Genome Mapping Laboratory, University of Georgia, were used for identification of BAC clones located at the genomic region that spans the Pp523 locus. Overgo probes hybridization analysis was carried out for markers OPK17_980, SCR15, SCJ19/PagI, and SCAFB1/BfuI, which define a 4.8 cM genomic region encompassing the Pp523 locus (Farinh\xc3\xb3 et al. 2007), and for 28 A. thaliana sequences (At1g01090 to At1g07360; Figure 1 and File S1) within the syntenic region defined by the most external B. oleracea markers OPK.17_980 (At1g01220) and SCAFB1/BfuI (At1g07420). Sequences of 40 bp were selected within the DNA-marker sequences for design of 24 bp forward and reverse overgo primers, which shared an overlapping terminal sequence of 8 bp. Two overgo probes were designed for each marker sequence so that the forward primer of the first overgo and the reverse primer of the second overgo could generate a PCR product for confirmation of hybridizing BACs. BAC clones (BoT01 and BoCig libraries) selected via hybridization against overgo probes derived from four Brassica oleracea markers that flank the locus Pp523 and 28 loci of the corresponding syntenic genomic region of Arabidopsis thaliana. Overgo probes labeling was performed at 37\xc2\xb0 for 2 hr in a total volume of 15 \xce\xbcl containing 0.0067 nM forward and reverse primers denatured at 94\xc2\xb0 for 5 min and cooled on ice, 1 \xce\xbcg BSA, 2.5 U of Taq polymerase, 1 \xce\xbcl of [\xce\xb132P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol) (MP Biomedicals), 1 \xce\xbcl of [\xce\xb1 32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) (MP Biomedicals), and 3 \xce\xbcl OLB [oligo-labeling buffer without dATP or dCTP, and random hexamers (Ross et al. 1999)]. The labeled probes were filtered through Sephadex minicolumns to remove the unincorporated radioactive nucleotides. Nylon membranes separated with a nylon mesh were incubated at 55\xc2\xb0 for 2 hr in a hybridization oven at 4.5 rpm in hybridization buffer [0.5 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 7% (w/v) SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.01% (w/v) BSA]. Radioactive overgo probes were hybridized at 55\xc2\xb0 for 18 hr, and membranes were washed thrice at 55\xc2\xb0 for 30 min with constant shaking, successively in buffer A [1x SSPE, 1% (w/v) SDS], buffer B [0.5 x SSPE, 1% (w/v) SDS], and again in buffer A. Membranes were blot-dried with filter paper, placed between two sheets of cellophane paper, and autoradiographed using two intensifying screens (L-Plus; Optonix) on X-ray film (Blue Medical, Source One) for 2 weeks at \xe2\x88\x9280\xc2\xb0. The hits on X-ray films were scored manually using gridded transparent templates that were scanned and read by the software ABBYY FineReader 5.0. The hit scores were manually corrected and converted to individual BAC clone addresses using the BACEater software (http://bacman.sourceforge.net/program/BACEater.html). The plasmid DNA of the selected BAC clones were isolated, the BAC ends were sequenced, and the sequences were submitted to GenBank. Plasmid DNA was isolated from BAC clones using a standard alkaline-lysis protocol and digested with 40 U of HindIII for 4.5 hr. The digestion products were run on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis for 16 hr at 95 V. The gel images were analyzed with IMAGE (Sulston et al. 1989), and the overlapping contigs were assembled using the software FPC V 4.7 and a cutoff E-value of e\xe2\x88\x927 (Soderlund et al. 2000). Two-hundred thirty additional B. oleracea BAC clones were selected in silico by exploiting the B. oleracea/A. thaliana syntenic relationship at the genomic region of the locus Pp523. The search for BAC-end sequences (BoT01 BAC library) exhibiting high level of similarity to A. thaliana sequences was performed using the Brassica oleracea BLAST search at the JCV Institute (http://blast.jcvi.org/er-blast/index.cgi?project=bog1) against 5000 nucleotides sequences consecutively retrieved from the A. thaliana chromosome 1 between At1g01770 and At1g07200 [Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), www.arabidopsis.org/]. Sequence similarities with E-values greater than 0.001 were assumed nonsignificant (Table 1). Specific primers were designed to convert BAC-end sequences into sequence-tagged site (STS) markers (see File S1). Polymorphic (BAC-end\xe2\x80\x93derived) STS markers were genetically mapped using the JoinMap 3.0 software (Van Ooijen and Voorrips 2001) set for the Kosambi function. The same software was used for drawing the linkage groups. Both polymorphic and monomorphic STS markers were used to establish and stabilize the physical map establishing the BAC-to-BAC ligation by PCR. The PCR products of the anchorage points between the BAC clones of the minimal tiling path were sequenced to confirm their similarity to the original BAC-end sequence. The screening of BoT01 and BoCig BAC libraries resulted in the identification of 58 BoT01 BAC clones and 12 BoCig BAC clones (Figure 1), putatively surrounding the downy mildew resistance gene. The fingerprinting (restriction) analysis of this set of BAC clones allowed their grouping into 11 small groups of at least two overlapping clones; nine BAC clones remained ungrouped (Figure 1). The BAC clones were assembled into a putative contig following the linear order of the Arabidopsis loci used to design the overgo probes (Figure 1). Excluding the cases of absence of significant similarity and of similarity to transposable element-like sequences, the order of the end sequences of these BAC clones appeared collinear to the A. thaliana genome (Table 1). However, genetic mapping associated the BAC clones with three different genomic regions of B. oleracea: a) some mapped as expected near the locus Pp523 in chromosome C8; b) a second, relatively smaller group mapped in the same chromosome but \xe2\x88\xbc60 cM away from Pp523; and c) a relatively large third group of BAC clones mapped in chromosome C5 (Figures 2 and 3). BAC clones mapped in chromosome C8. (Right) BAC clones mapped near the locus Pp523. (Left) BAC clones mapped apart from the resistance locus. Accurately mapped clones are represented vertically. Premapped clones are represented horizontally, ordered according to their collinearity with A. thaliana. The forward and reverse end of BAC clones are represented by a triangle and a lozenge, respectively. Black-filled triangles and lozenges indicate sequence identity between overlapping BAC ends. BAC-to-BAC (PCR) ligations are indicated by intersecting dotted lines. BAC clones mapped in chromosome C5. Accurately mapped BAC clones are displayed vertically. Premapped BAC clones are presented horizontally, ordered according to their collinearity with A. thaliana. BAC-to-BAC ligations (via PCR) and BAC-end identification are represented as in Figure 2. The genetic mapping of the second set of BAC clones (selected in silico) from the BoT01 library followed the same tendency as the first set, mapping to the same three regions of the B. oleracea genome (Figures 2 and 3). Once this problem was identified, a premapping step was included based on the segregation analysis of 14 progeny plants and subsequently confirming the segregation analysis of the putative Pp523-related clones in the remaining mapping population. As the main objective of this work was the construction of a BAC contig spanning the resistance gene of interest, the accurate mapping of some BAC clones in the second genomic region (in chromosome C8) and in the third genomic region (in chromosome C5) was not done. The BAC clones that remained at the premapped stage are clearly discriminated (horizontally displayed) in Figures 2 and 3 and File S1. Multiple BAC clones were anchored to the genetically mapped ones, either by inferring overlap (established by restriction analysis and confirmed by PCR), or by BAC-to-BAC ligation through PCR (using STS markers derived from BAC-end sequences), or in some cases, by alignment of identical end sequences. Anchored BAC clones were accepted as being genetically mapped, and they are displayed vertically in the above-cited figures. In total, 83 BAC clones were accurately mapped in the region (\xe2\x88\xbc4.6 cM in the present map) surrounding the downy mildew resistance locus Pp523 in chromosome C8 (Figure 2). A relatively smaller group of 33 BAC clones were mapped at the other end of the chromosome C8 (Figure 2), while a large group of 63 BAC clones mapped to chromosome C5, where they are scattered throughout 18.5 cM (Figure 3). The distribution of the selected BAC clones by more than one location was not completely surprising because the triplicate nature of Brassica genomes has been extensively documented both at the genetic map (Cavell et al. 1998; Lagercrantz 1998; Parkin et al. 2005) and the microsynteny levels (O\xe2\x80\x99Neill and Bancroft 2000). The triplication of the Brassica genomes, despite multiple chromosome rearrangements, gene loss, and insertions (Town et al. 2006), is accompanied by extensive conservation of macro- and microsynteny (Kowalski et al. 1994; Lan et al. 2000; O\xe2\x80\x99Neill and Bancroft 2000; Parkin et al. 2005; Kaczmarek et al. 2009) with A. thaliana, a feature that seems also to be valid for the genomic region that surrounds the Pp523 locus in B. oleracea. A fine genetic map of the 4.8 cM region that encompasses locus Pp523 was assembled by the inclusion of 25 new STS markers derived from BAC-end sequences (Figure 2). This allowed defining a shorter genomic region of \xe2\x88\xbc2.9 cM spanning the downy mildew resistance locus Pp523 for the construction of a robust physical map for which a minimal tiling path of 13 BAC clones (BoT01 library) was established (Figure 4). Because of possible errors due to the triplication of the genome, which can originate multiple PCR products similar in length but with relatively different sequences and from different genomic loci, the PCR products that confirm the BAC-to-BAC linkages within the minimal tiling path were sequenced and carefully compared with the original BAC-end (STS) sequences used to design the primers. In all cases, they were identical. Genetic and physical map of the genomic region that encompasses the downy mildew resistance locus Pp523. Bold outline and bold text identify 13 BAC clones (BoT01 library) that constitute a minimal tiling path in the physical map. Triangles, lozenges, and dotted lines are as in Figures 2 and 3. Exploitation of the genetic similarity and syntenic relationship between A. thaliana and B. oleracea has guided the construction of a physical map surrounding the downy mildew resistance locus Pp523, by integration of genetic mapping with probe hybridization to BAC libraries and in silico selection of BAC clones using end-sequence information. Two main obstacles have slowed, but not compromised, the accomplishment of this task: a) the large amount of transposable element-like sequences in the B. oleracea genome; and 2) the triplicate nature of the B. oleracea genome. A large percentage (62 out of 429; 14.5%) of the BAC clones of the BoT01 library exhibit transposable element-like sequences at one or at both ends. By creating artifactual similarities between BAC-end sequences and between these and Arabidopsis genome sequences, this genome feature significantly reduced the number of BAC-end sequences suitable for mapping purposes and constrained our ability to employ Brassica/Arabidopsis synteny. The total length of transposable elements in B. oleracea has been calculated to be \xe2\x88\xbc15 times that of A. thaliana and to represent \xe2\x88\xbc120 Mb or 20% of the genome, leading to the suggestion that amplification of RNA and DNA transposable elements significantly contributed to the genome expansion of this crop species (Zhang and Wessler, 2004). Nevertheless, the triplication of the genomic region of interest was the major constraint to a more efficient exploitation of the A. thaliana/B. oleracea genetic relatedness during the construction of the present physical map. Besides the region in the B. oleracea chromosome C8 where the Pp523 locus was previously mapped (Farinh\xc3\xb3 et al. 2004, 2007; Carlier et al. 2011), the BAC clones mapped in two additional regions, one at \xe2\x88\xbc60 cM in the same chromosome (C8) and another, apparently larger, in chromosome C5, evidencing a triplication of this Arabidopsis genomic region in B. oleracea. Today is largely accepted that the diploid Brassica species are paleohexaploids (Schmidt et al. 2001; Parkin et al. 2003; Lysak et al. 2005). With the support of various other studies that highlighted the Brassica genome triplication (Cavell et al. 1998; Lagercrantz 1998; Lan et al. 2000; O\xe2\x80\x99Neill and Bancroft 2000; Parkin et al. 2005) and their own data, Lysak et al. (2005) proposed that after the Arabidopsis and Brassica lineages split, \xe2\x88\xbc14\xe2\x80\x9324 Mya (millions of years ago) according to Yang et al. (1999) and Koch et al. (2000), an hexaploidation event occurred 7.9\xe2\x80\x9314.6 Mya that gave rise to an ancestral triplicated Brassiceae genome, a feature that remained distinctive of all species of this tribe. The early findings of Kowalski et al. (1994) and the comparative genetic mapping of over one thousand RFLP loci in A. thaliana and B. napus carried out by Parkin et al. (2005) suggested the existence of \xe2\x88\xbc20\xe2\x80\x9325 conserved genomic units within the A. thaliana genome which duplication and rearrangement could generate the present B. napus genome. The majority of the conserved units were found in six copies, and 81% of the loci used for comparison were mapped to the triplicated regions by Parkin et al. (2005), consistent with the hypothesis of a hexaploid ancestor for the diploid Brassica progenitors. Nevertheless, the mechanism of formation of the present structure of the Brassica genomes is assumed to include multiple rearrangements via insertions, deletions, and translocations (Parkin et al. 2005; Town et al. 2006). The comparative mapping study of Parkin et al. (2005) and, specifically, the block of markers A (C1A) at the terminus of the top arm of A. thaliana chromosome 1 identified by these authors are of particular interest. This block corresponds to the genome block A defined by Schranz et al. (2006) in the \xe2\x80\x9cancestral karyotype\xe2\x80\x9d of Lysak et al. (2006), which is delimited by the A. thaliana sequences At1g01560 and At1g19330, clearly spanning the A. thaliana genome segment between loci At1g01570 and At1g07420 syntenic to the Pp523 region enclosed by the homologous B. oleracea markers SCJ19/PagI and SCAFB1/Bfu (Farinh\xc3\xb3 et al. 2007). This genome block (C1A or A) was found by Parkin et al. (2005) to have: i) a counterpart in the extremity of the linkage group/chromosome N18 (C8) apparently corresponding to the B. oleracea chromosome C8 region where the downy mildew resistance gene Pp523 is embedded and part of the selected BAC clones map to (in the present work); ii) a second homologous region in the same chromosome (N18/C8), which apparently corresponds to the second region of BAC mapping; and iii) a large homologous region in the chromosome (N15/C5) corresponding to the B. oleracea third genome region to which a large group of the BAC clones also map. No other counterparts for this Arabidopsis genomic C1A/A segment were identified among the other B. napus C genome chromosomes (N11\xe2\x80\x93N19). The analysis of an integrated map of B. napus that includes the map of Parkin et al. (2005) recently published by Wang et al. (2011) allows the above observations to be clearly confirmed, as this map shares common reference SSR markers with our map (Carlier et al. 2011). Nevertheless, note that chromosome C8 of our map and those of Wang et al. (2011) and Parkin et al. (2005) are inverted relative to one another. The analysis of the alignment of B. napus markers with their homology BLAST hits within the Arabidopsis chromosomes (Wang et al. 2011) shows that the C1A/A block presents two main concentration plots of collinear hits in opposite directions at the expected positions on chromosome C8 and a large third concentration plot of hits on chromosome C5. Some hits can be observed on chromosome C7, whereas the other C genome chromosomes exhibit almost no hits. These results coincide and are confirmed by our BAC mapping results. Except for 2 BACs mapped to chromosome 2 and 1 BAC mapped to chromosome C6, the other (179) BACs mapped to two different regions on chromosome C8 and one region on chromosome C5. One might expect the levels of identity between the B. oleracea BAC-end sequences and a specific Arabidopsis DNA sequence to exhibit some kind of pattern or tendency according to the Brassica genome region where they map. However, this is not the case. For example, the BAC-end sequences 49K12TR (C8, Pp523 region), 106H20TR (C8, distant from Pp523), and 19M3TF (C5) show, respectively, 94%, 87%, and 90% of identity to a sequence stretch of gene At1g05180, whereas the BAC ends 121A8TR (C8, Pp523 region), 76A16TR (C8, distant from Pp523), and 89C6TF (C5) show, respectively, 85%, 87%, and 90% identity to a sequence stretch of gene At1g05630. In other words, the location of a specific DNA sequence in the B. oleracea genome cannot be inferred from its level of identity to a specific A. thaliana sequence. So far, a 2.0x BAC genome library from a downy mildew resistant S4 line derived from the original resistant genotype has been constructed at the University of Algarve, and a replica of the minimal tiling path (Figure 4) is currently being assembled using this BAC library. The identification of polymorphisms between the two BAC contigs, in particular regarding disease resistance gene-like sequences, is expected to produce significant information to foster our research toward the isolation of the downy mildew resistance gene Pp523.

9,['Robert A. Drewell'],"December 8, 2011.",Transcription Factor Binding Site Redundancy in Embryonic Enhancers of the Drosophila Bithorax Complex,"b'The molecular control of gene expression in development is mediated through the activity of embryonic enhancer cis-regulatory modules. This activity is determined by the combination of repressor and activator transcription factors that bind at specific DNA sequences in the enhancer. A proposed mechanism to ensure a high fidelity of transcriptional output is functional redundancy between closely spaced binding sites within an enhancer. Here I show that at the bithorax complex in Drosophila there is selective redundancy for both repressor and activator factor binding sites in vivo. The absence of compensatory binding sites is responsible for two rare gain-of-function mutations in the complex.Enhancer cis-regulatory modules are regions of nonprotein coding genomic DNA that bind protein transcription factors (TFs) to direct expression of target genes (Arnone and Davidson 1997; Borok et al. 2010). Transcriptional regulation by enhancers is fundamental to embryonic development and evolutionary diversity in metazoans (Levine and Tjian 2003; Wittkopp 2010; Wray 2007). The Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex (BX-C) provides a tractable model system in which to dissect the functional activities of embryonic enhancers. The BX-C is a 330-kb genomic region (Martin et al. 1995) that contains just three homeotic genes (Lewis 1978). Expression of these genes is controlled by numerous enhancers arranged in the infraabdominal (iab) intergenic regions (Celniker et al. 1990), which regulate the spatial and temporal expression of the homeotic genes along the anteroposterior axis of the developing embryo (for detailed reviews, see Akbari et al. 2006; and Maeda and Karch 2006). The activity of the BX-C embryonic enhancers is controlled by TFs expressed at the earliest stages of development (Busturia and Bienz 1993; Ho et al. 2009; Zhou et al. 1999). The TFs form input signals by recognizing and binding in a sequence-specific manner in the enhancer DNA at transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Once bound, TFs mediate the transcriptional output of the enhancer in a number of ways, including interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery at the promoter of the target gene which helps recruit RNA polymerase II (activators) (Kadonaga 2004) or by preventing the binding of additional protein factors at closely located binding sites (short-range repressors) (Small et al. 1991). Activators can act over very large genomic distances (>50 kb) (Ho et al. 2011), whereas short-range repression appears to be limited to distances of approximately 100 bp and certainly less than 400 bp (Kulkarni and Arnosti 2005). For example, the IAB5 enhancer in the BX-C is activated by the pair-rule TF FUSHI-TARAZU (FTZ) but is repressed by the gap TFs KRUPPEL (KR) and HUNCHBACK (HB) (Figure 1A) (Busturia and Bienz 1993; Ho et al. 2009; Starr et al. 2011). Because gene expression must be tightly regulated to allow normal embryonic development, then it follows that the recruitment of specific TFs to enhancers should be very robust. A critical molecular mechanism to ensure this robustness is selection for clusters of functional binding sites (Berman et al. 2002; Berman et al. 2004), as evidenced by the evolutionary conservation of TFBSs at enhancers in the BX-C (Ho et al. 2009; Starr et al. 2011) and at the even-skipped gene (Crocker and Erives 2008; Hare et al. 2008b; Ludwig et al. 1998) in divergent insect species. An additional potential mechanism yet to be fully explored is the extent to which clustering is responsible for functional redundancy between binding sites (Figure 1B). The key question is whether redundancy of TFBSs is a common theme in embryonic enhancers. One way to answer this question is to investigate examples of sequence mutations that result in disruption of a TFBS by examining the functional consequences for enhancer activity. However, during 30 years of intensive molecular analysis of the 330 kb of the BX-C, only two such mutations have ever been identified; the Superabdominal (Sab) mutation in the IAB5 enhancer (Celniker et al. 1990) and the Hyperabdominal (Hab) mutation in the IAB2 enhancer (Lewis 1978). In both cases the loss of a KR short-range repressor binding site permits the enhancer to respond to an input signal from an activator in ectopic embryonic segments (Ho et al. 2009; Shimell et al. 1994). Why are there so few mutations in the BX-C that disrupt enhancer function? The discovery of only two gain-of-function point mutations in the entire complex suggests that there may be extensive functional redundancy between repressor binding sites at the enhancers. The aim of this study is to investigate the extent of TFBS clustering in the BX-C and address the implications for binding site redundancy and enhancer function.'","b'The molecular control of gene expression in development is mediated through the activity of embryonic enhancer cis-regulatory modules.

(A) The regulatory output of the IAB5 and IAB2 enhancers is determined by specific TF inputs. The pair-rule TF FUSHI-TARAZU (FTZ) acts as an activator of IAB5 in alternating body segments of the embryo, whereas KRUPPEL (KR) and HUNCHBACK (HB) act as repressors at the BX-C enhancers in broad regions of the embryo. The activator for IAB2 is currently unknown. (B) Model of TFBS redundancy at an enhancer (orange rectangle). In the upper panel, the distance between two neighboring binding sites (x) is close enough so that the loss of one site can be functionally compensated for by the adjacent site. In the lower panel, the distances to the neighboring sites (y and z) are too great to allow functional redundancy. (C) The calculated ratio of TFBS spacing for the entire BX-C (excluding all enhancers); the IAB8, IAB7, and IAB6 enhancers grouped together (Enhancers); IAB5 and IAB2 for KR (at high stringency [ln(p) < \xe2\x88\x929.0] and low stringency [ln(p) < \xe2\x88\x927.4]), HB, and FTZ are shown. A value >1 indicates that binding sites are closer together, and a value <1 indicates that sites are more distantly spaced relative to the expected spacing (= size of the entire BX-C/total number of binding sites). Because gene expression must be tightly regulated to allow normal embryonic development, then it follows that the recruitment of specific TFs to enhancers should be very robust. A critical molecular mechanism to ensure this robustness is selection for clusters of functional binding sites (Berman et al. 2002; Berman et al. 2004), as evidenced by the evolutionary conservation of TFBSs at enhancers in the BX-C (Ho et al. 2009; Starr et al. 2011) and at the even-skipped gene (Crocker and Erives 2008; Hare et al. 2008b; Ludwig et al. 1998) in divergent insect species. An additional potential mechanism yet to be fully explored is the extent to which clustering is responsible for functional redundancy between binding sites (Figure 1B). The key question is whether redundancy of TFBSs is a common theme in embryonic enhancers. One way to answer this question is to investigate examples of sequence mutations that result in disruption of a TFBS by examining the functional consequences for enhancer activity. However, during 30 years of intensive molecular analysis of the 330 kb of the BX-C, only two such mutations have ever been identified; the Superabdominal (Sab) mutation in the IAB5 enhancer (Celniker et al. 1990) and the Hyperabdominal (Hab) mutation in the IAB2 enhancer (Lewis 1978).

Why are there so few mutations in the BX-C that disrupt enhancer function? The discovery of only two gain-of-function point mutations in the entire complex suggests that there may be extensive functional redundancy between repressor binding sites at the enhancers. The aim of this study is to investigate the extent of TFBS clustering in the BX-C and address the implications for binding site redundancy and enhancer function. Genomic regions from the Drosophila melanogaster BX-C from the annotated U31961 sequence were identified in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project D. melanogaster genome (annotated April 2006 release) on the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser (http://www.genome.ucsc.edu) (Kent et al. 2002) and shown as \xe2\x80\x9cChr3R\xe2\x80\x9d in Figure 2. (A) IAB5 and (B) IAB2 enhancers (orange boxes) and surrounding 20-kb genomic regions are shown as a custom track in the UCSC Genome Browser. PATSER was used to predict the spatial distribution of binding sites on the forward (top) and reverse (bottom) DNA strands for KRUPPEL (KR, red), HUNCHBACK (HB, purple), and FUSHI-TARAZU (FTZ, green). Rectangle height is proportional to the score strength of each predicted TF binding site. KR binding sites in the enhancer and neighboring sites are indicated with arrows. The Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project ChIP/chip track (Macarthur et al. 2009) shows the location of verified in vivo binding sites for KR (red), HB (purple), and FTZ (green). The BNTNP chromatin accessibility track (black) identifies DNase I sensitive sites. Sequence from the D. melanogaster BX-C was analyzed by use of the UCSC Genome Browser as previously described (Ho et al. 2009; Starr et al. 2011). PATSER (http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/patser_form.cgi) (Hertz and Stormo 1999; Thomas-Chollier et al. 2008) and previously assembled Position Weight Matrices for the three TFs; KRUPPEL (KR), HUNCHBACK (HB), and FUSHI-TARAZU (FTZ) (Ho et al. 2009; Starr et al. 2011) were used to search for binding sites. ln(p-value) cutoff values for predicted sites were selected according to the values of confirmed functional binding sites as described in previous studies (Hare et al. 2008a; Ho et al. 2009; Starr et al. 2011). TF binding and DNase I accessibility data were mapped on the BX-C sequence in the UCSC Genome Browser (Kent et al. 2002). The Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project ChIP/chip track (Macarthur et al. 2009) was used to identify the location of verified binding sites for the KR, HB, and FTZ TFs in stage 4-5 embryos (1% false discovery rate). The BNTNP chromatin accessibility track was used to identify DNase I sensitive sites in stage 5 embryos. The ORegAnno track (Griffith et al. 2008) was used to identify the genomic location of the IAB5 and IAB2 enhancers. If clustering is an important functional feature for TFBS redundancy in embryonic enhancers of the BX-C, then one prediction is that there should be a greater likelihood of finding two binding sites for a particular TF in close proximity to each other in a defined enhancer when compared with the complex as a whole. To address this hypothesis, I analyzed the distribution of KR binding sites across the entire BX-C (supporting information, Table S1). Intriguingly, at high stringency (ln(p) < \xe2\x88\x929.0) KR binding sites are enriched in the BX-C when compared with randomized sequence generated from the entire BX-C (Table S1 and Table S2, \xcf\x872 distribution test, P = 1.52\xe2\x88\x927). In addition KR sites are highly enriched in the characterized IAB8, IAB7, and IAB6 enhancers compared with the whole of the BX-C (Figure 1C, \xcf\x872 distribution test, P = 4.06\xe2\x88\x92158) with an average space between sites of 1499.1 and 2978.5 bp, respectively. Surprisingly, IAB5 and IAB2 are significantly depleted in KR binding sites (Figure 1C), with each enhancer containing only one site corresponding to the functional sites identified in the Sab and Hab mutations (Ho et al. 2009; Shimell et al. 1994). In the case of IAB5, the average distance to the neighboring KR sites is 8028 bp, whereas for IAB2 it is 5857.5 bp. For IAB5 and IAB2 no single adjacent KR site is closer than 1702 bp, well beyond the proposed range of action for a short-range repressor (Kulkarni and Arnosti 2005; Li and Arnosti 2011), indicating that in both cases there is no functionally redundant KR site available to compensate for loss of binding at the Sab and Hab sites (Figure 2). Even when a less-stringent threshold value (ln(p) < \xe2\x88\x927.4) is used that identifies four times as many putative KR binding sites in the BX-C, the IAB5 and IAB2 enhancers are depleted in sites (Table S3 and Figure 1C). In contrast, the relative abundance of KR sites at the other embryonic enhancers from the BX-C may provide an explanation for the fact that no gain-of-function mutations have ever been characterized in the complex outside of IAB5 and IAB2. To investigate whether the enrichment of repressor TFBSs in embryonic enhancers extends beyond KR I also examined the spacing of HB binding sites across the BX-C (Table S4). In agreement with the finding for KR, HB sites are found in close proximity in the embryonic enhancers of the complex (Figure 1C, \xcf\x872 distribution test, P = 2.28\xe2\x88\x929). In the case of HB, the IAB5 (P = 6.12\xe2\x88\x9228) and IAB2 (P = 9.59\xe2\x88\x9248) enhancers are also highly enriched in binding sites compared with the BX-C as a whole (Figure 1C and 2). This discovery correlates with the absence of any gain-of-function mutations resulting from the loss of HB binding sites in the BX-C and suggests that extensive functional redundancy between the multiple HB sites in each enhancer may exist. Such clustering also appears to extend to FTZ TFBSs in the BX-C (Table S5), because sites for this factor are significantly enriched in the IAB5 enhancer (Figure 1C, \xcf\x872 distribution test, P = 9.02\xe2\x88\x9226), for which FTZ is the known activator (Busturia and Bienz 1993), but depleted in IAB2 (\xcf\x872 distribution test, P = 1.01\xe2\x88\x9225; Figure 1C), which does not recruit FTZ (Figure 2). Taken together, the data indicate that extensive functional redundancy exists through clustering for TFBSs in the embryonic enhancers of the BX-C. This is reflected in the close spacing of repressor (KR and HB) and activator (FTZ) binding sites in enhancers that are known to recruit these factors in vivo (Figure 2) and offers insight into why so few gain-of-function mutations have ever been discovered in the complex. Furthermore, in the two examples where a point mutation in a TFBS from the BX-C does appear to prevent the functional recruitment of the KR repressor (Sab and Hab) there is a significant depletion of binding sites in the genomic neighborhood that could potentially compensate for loss of KR binding.

In Drosophila melanogaster, meiosis is tightly coupled to oocyte development, and early embryos undergo specialized S-M mitoses that are supported by maternal products. We previously showed that the small phosphoprotein \xce\xb1-endosulfine (Endos) is required for normal oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryonic mitoses in Drosophila. In this study, we performed a genetic screen for dominant enhancers of endos00003 and identified several genomic regions that, when deleted, lead to impaired fertility of endos00003/+ heterozygous females. We uncovered matrimony (mtrm), which encodes a Polo kinase inhibitor, as a strong dominant enhancer of endos. mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 females are sterile because of defects in early embryonic mitoses, and this phenotype is reverted by removal of one copy of polo. These results provide compelling genetic evidence that excessive Polo activity underlies the strong functional interaction between endos00003 and mtrm126. Moreover, we show that endos is required for the increased expression of Mtrm in mature oocytes, which is presumably loaded into early embryos. These data are consistent with the model that maternal endos antagonizes Polo function in the early embryo to ensure normal mitoses through its effects on Mtrm expression during late oogenesis. Finally, we also identified genomic deletions that lead to loss of viability of endos00003/+ heterozygotes, consistent with recently published studies showing that endos is required zygotically to regulate the cell cycle during development.Precise control of the cell-cycle machinery at specific developmental stages is crucial to ensure appropriate cellular outcomes, and research in Drosophila melanogaster has led to significant advances in understanding how this regulation is achieved (Lee and Orr-Weaver 2003). Two relevant examples of coordination between the cell cycle and development are found in oocyte meiotic maturation during oogenesis and in the specialized early embryonic mitoses. Drosophila oocytes develop within egg chambers, or follicles, which progress through 14 stages of development within ovarian subunits termed ovarioles (Spradling 1993). Each egg chamber is composed of an inner germline cyst containing one oocyte and 15 supportive nurse cells and is surrounded by a monolayer of somatic follicle cells. The oocyte initiates meiosis within very early cysts before the acquisition of follicle cells but remains arrested in prophase of meiosis I through most of oogenesis (Figure 1A, A\xe2\x80\xb2; King 1970). During the oocyte arrest in prophase I, the egg chamber goes through most of its development, including the dumping of nurse cell cytoplasmic contents into the growing oocyte during stage 11 (Spradling 1993). At stage 13, as the remaining nurse cell nuclei are gradually eliminated by cell death, the fully grown oocyte undergoes meiotic maturation, a process whereby the prophase I arrest is released and the oocyte progresses through a second arrest in metaphase I (Figure 1B, B\xe2\x80\xb2, B\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2). The metaphase I arrest is maintained in mature stage 14 oocytes until egg activation takes place as the oocyte passes through the oviduct during egg laying (Horner and Wolfner 2008). Embryonic development, which ensues after egg activation and fertilization, relies initially on maternal RNA and proteins loaded into the oocyte during oogenesis, independently of zygotic transcription (Lee and Orr-Weaver 2003). Specifically, the first 13 embryonic cell cycles, which occur within a common, syncytial cytoplasm, are maternally controlled and represent variant mitotic cell cycles that lack gap (G) phases and simply alternate between DNA synthesis (S) and mitosis (M; Figure 1C, C\xe2\x80\xb2, C\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2). Subsequently, interphase lengthens by the addition of G2 and then G1 phases, and zygotic transcription becomes essential (Lee and Orr-Weaver 2003). Our previous studies uncovered critical roles for the small phosphoprotein \xce\xb1-endosulfine (Endos) in both oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryonic mitoses in Drosophila (Von Stetina et al. 2008). Oocytes in endos00003 homozygous mutant females have prolonged prophase I arrest and abnormal nuclear envelope breakdown, and they fail to progress into metaphase I. In addition, the rare resulting embryos that initiate development display abnormal DNA and spindle morphologies during early, maternally controlled mitoses (Von Stetina et al. 2008). Consistent with these cell-cycle defects, endos00003 homozygous mutant oocytes have markedly low levels of in vivo MPM2 phosphoepitopes, which result from phosphorylation of targets of the Polo and Cdk1 cell-cycle regulatory kinases. Paradoxically, however, endos00003 homozygous mutant oocytes show normal levels of Cdk1 kinase activity in in vitro assays (Von Stetina et al. 2008). Nevertheless, recent biochemical studies using Xenopus egg extracts showed that upon its phosphorylation by Greatwall (Gwl) kinase, the vertebrate homolog of Endos binds to and inhibits protein phosphatase 2A, a Cdk1 antagonist that dephosphorylates its targets (Gharbi-Ayachi et al. 2010; Mochida et al. 2010). In addition, endos was very recently shown to control Drosophila cell cycles through a similar pathway (Rangone et al. 2011), potentially explaining our paradoxical findings. Despite these recent advances, Endos likely has additional molecular functions that contribute to cell-cycle regulation. For example, in an in vitro screen for Endos binding partners, two specific interactors were identified, including the E3 ubiquitin ligase Elgi. Interestingly, although mutation of elgi results in premature meiotic maturation, Elgi does not appear to target Endos for ubiquination or to mediate the effects of Endos on MPM2 epitope levels (Von Stetina et al. 2008). A complete understanding of the diverse molecular roles of Endos will require the identification of additional genes that function with this small regulatory protein in the control of meiotic maturation and/or early embryonic mitoses. Here, we describe a genetic screen for dominant enhancers of endos00003 heterozygotes. We reasoned that halving the gene dosage of endos may sensitize females to reduced dosage of other genes functioning with endos to control meiotic maturation and/or early embryonic mitoses, leading to reduced fertility of double heterozygous females. We screened approximately 200 available deficiencies and identified 11 genomic regions that when deleted dominantly lead to sterility or semi-sterility of endos00003 heterozygous females. Our screen also identified five genomic regions that result in lethality of endos00003 heterozygotes, uncovering a zygotic function of endos. Further analyses of an enhancer reducing the fertility of endos00003 females revealed that matrimony (mtrm), a negative regulator of Polo kinase (Xiang et al. 2007), functions together with Endos to regulate early embryonic mitoses. Specifically, we find that mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 double-heterozygous females have markedly reduced fertility relative to single heterozygotes because of defects in early, maternally controlled embryonic mitoses, and that this strong genetic interaction is likely due to the fact that Endos regulates Mtrm levels during late oogenesis.'","b'The coordination of cell-cycle events with developmental processes is essential for the reproductive success of organisms.

Drosophila stocks and crosses were maintained at 22-25\xc2\xb0 on standard medium. y w was used as a wild-type control. endos00003 is a strong hypomorphic allele caused by a P element insertion in its 5\xe2\x80\xb2 untranslated region (Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling 2004; Von Stetina et al. 2008). mtrm126 is a molecular null allele (Xiang et al. 2007); in all crosses, mtrm126 was introduced into the analyzed genotypes via the male because this stock is contaminated with Wolbachia, a maternally transmitted intracellular bacterium (Serbus et al. 2008). polo16-1 is a strong hypomorph (Donaldson et al. 2001; Roseman et al. 1995), and the null elgi1 allele has been described (Von Stetina et al. 2008). Deficiency Kit stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/). The GFP::polo transgene carries a fully functional polo gene within a 7-kb genomic fragment with the GFP coding sequence fused immediately upstream of and in frame with the polo coding region (Moutinho-Santos et al. 1999). Balancer chromosomes and other genetic elements are described in FlyBase (http://flybase.org). For measurement of embryo hatch rates, females of various genotypes were crossed to y w males, and embryos collected overnight. For most genotypes, 100 to 150 collected embryos were placed in groups of 10 on molasses plates containing a small amount of wet yeast in their center. (For genotypes displaying low rates of egg laying, fewer embryos were collected.) Plates were incubated in a humid chamber at 25\xc2\xb0 for 2 d, and unhatched embryos were counted and subtracted from the total to determine the hatch rate as a percentage. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and statistical analysis was performed using the Student\xe2\x80\x99s t test. To identify deficiencies that lead to female sterility or lethality of endos00003/+ heterozygotes, or endos00003 dominant enhancers, we performed an F1 screen (supporting information, Figure S1). endos00003/TM3, Sb1 virgin females were crossed to males carrying 208 balanced deficiencies (Df; File S1) and progeny were analyzed. (We estimate that these deficiencies represent roughly 45% genome coverage because the entire Deficiency Kit from the Bloomington Stock Center contains 469 deficiencies, which together provide 98% coverage of the genome.) If no adult endos00003/Df or Df/+; endos00003/+ flies resulted from the cross (i.e., only flies carrying balancer chromosomes were present among progeny), the genetic interaction was considered lethal. Otherwise, four endos00003/Df or Df/+; endos00003/+ females were crossed to three y w males to test their fertility. If these females yielded drastically reduced or no progeny, the genetic interaction was considered semisterile or sterile, respectively. Only deficiencies that yielded reproducible results as endos00003/+ enhancers in triplicate experiments were added to the final list of enhancer deficiencies. For each interacting genomic region identified through the deficiency screen, additional deficiencies were tested as shown in Table S1 and Table S3. For Western blotting analyses, ovaries or egg chambers were homogenized, electrophoresed, and transferred to membranes as described (Von Stetina et al. 2008). Membranes were blocked and probed with 1:500 guinea pig polyclonal anti-Mtrm (Xiang et al. 2007), 1:4,000 rat monoclonal anti-\xce\xb1-tubulin (YL1/2, Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corporation), or 1:50 mouse monoclonal anti-Actin (JLA20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). IRDye 800-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig (Rockland) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, donkey anti-guinea pig, or goat anti-rat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) secondary antibodies were used at 1:5000 or 1:4000 dilutions. The Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences) or enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Life Science) was used for detection. Egg chamber staging and analysis of oocyte meiotic maturation were performed as described (Von Stetina et al. 2008), with some modifications. In brief, ovaries were dissected, fixed, and stained in 0.5 \xce\xbcg/ml 4\xe2\x80\xb2,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min. Analysis of DNA and spindles in early embryonic mitoses were performed essentially as described (Von Stetina et al. 2008). In brief, 0- to 60-min embryos were collected, dechorionated, shaken vigorously for 2 min in 1:1 heptane:methanol, fixed in methanol overnight, and stained with anti-\xce\xb1-tubulin FITC-conjugated antibody (DM1A clone; Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:300 dilution and 0.5 \xce\xbcg/ml DAPI or 10 \xce\xbcg/ml propidium iodide following RNAse A treatment. Samples mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) were imaged with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 or AxioImager-A2 fluorescence microscope, or LSM700 confocal microscope. For statistical analysis, results were subjected to the Yates\xe2\x80\x99 chi-square test (\xcf\x872= \xce\xa3(|O-E|\xe2\x88\x92 1/2)2/ E) (Yates 1934). The small phosphoprotein Endos has critical biological roles in Drosophila oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryonic mitoses (Von Stetina et al. 2008). Although the molecular mechanisms of action of Endos during cell cycle regulation are likely complex, recent biochemical studies uncovering an in vitro role for the Xenopus homolog as a stoichiometric binding inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (Gharbi-Ayachi et al. 2010; Mochida et al. 2010) suggest that the gene dosage of endos might be relevant for its roles in the cell cycle. It is therefore conceivable that although endos00003/+ heterozygous females are largely phenotypically normal (Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling 2004), removal of one copy of other genes that function together with endos in the regulation of meiotic maturation and/or early embryonic mitoses might genetically enhance endos00003, resulting in sterility or semisterility of those females. We performed an F1 screen for enhancers of endos00003 heterozygous females using 208 deficiencies (\xe2\x88\xbc45% genome coverage) from the Bloomington Stock Center Deficiency Kit (Figure S1 and File S1). As expected, Df(3L)fz-GF3b, which uncovers the endos gene itself, led to complete female sterility in combination with endos00003. We also found 11 additional deficiencies that impair the fertility of endos00003 heterozygous females (Figure 2 and Table 1), and for all of the regions uncovered by these interacting deficiencies (except for Df(3L)BSC815; see below) additional deficiencies were tested to refine the results (Table S1). Chromosomal distribution of deficiencies that dominantly enhance endos00003/+. Gray bars depict chromosome arms (X, 2L, 2R, 3L, and 3R), and black numbers indicate polytene chromosome divisions. Deficiencies shown in red dominantly cause sterility or semisterility of endos00003 heterozygous females, whereas those shown in blue dominantly cause lethality of endos00003 heterozygous animals. Red and blue bars above deficiency indicate their deleted genomic regions according to FlyBase (http://flybase.org). Asterisk indicates endos location. Our screen also revealed a zygotic role for endos. Specifically, five deficiencies led to zygotic lethality of endos00003 heterozygotes during development (Figure 2 and Table S2), and additional deficiencies uncovering the identified interacting regions were also tested (Table S3). These results are consistent with a recent study that showed that endos function is zygotically required for proper neuroblast cell cycles during Drosophila development (Rangone et al. 2011). Df(3L)BSC815, which removes region 66C3\xe2\x88\x9266D4, drastically reduced the fertility of endos00003/+ heterozygous females, with hatch rates of 26% for embryos produced by these females (Table 1). Region 66C3\xe2\x88\x9266D4 contains matrimony (mtrm), a gene previously reported to encode a negative regulator of Polo kinase that controls the timing of meiotic maturation and chromosome segregation in a dose-sensitive manner. Females that are heterozygous for the null mtrm126 allele display premature nuclear envelope breakdown (a hallmark of meiotic maturation) and increased frequencies of X and 4th chromosome nondisjunction, and these phenotypes are completely suppressed by removal of one copy of polo (Xiang et al. 2007). To test whether the interaction between endos00003 and Df(3L)BSC815 was caused by the loss of one copy of mtrm, we generated mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 females. Indeed, the fertility of these double heterozygous females was significantly reduced relative to the fertility of mtrm126/+ or endos00003/+ single heterozygous females (see Figure 4A). endos and mtrm show dominant genetic interactions during early embryonic mitoses. (A) Hatch rates for embryos derived from y w control, endos00003/+, mtrm126/+, or mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 females in wild-type (2 copies of polo), polo16-1/+ (one copy of polo) or GFP::polo (three copies of polo) background. Three hundred embryos were analyzed per genotype. a vs. a, P = 2.8 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x927. b vs. b, P = 6.8 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9276. c vs. c, P = 2.1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9212. d vs. d, P = 2.5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9278. e vs. e, P = 4.3 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x92106. (B) Quantification of percentage of nuclei from embryos derived from y w control, endos00003/+, mtrm126/+, or mtrm126 +/+ endos00003, or mtrm126 + polo16-1/+ endos00003 + females displaying normal or defective DNA and spindle morphology. In addition to misaligned DNA, other defects include attached spindles, highly condensed DNA, or no mitotic nuclei with two rosettes present. Numbers of nuclei (n) analyzed are shown above bars. Ten to fifteen embryos were analyzed for each genotype. (C\xe2\x80\x93H) Examples of y w control embryo nucleus with normal DNA morphology (C), or nuclei from embryos produced by mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 female showing misaligned DNA and abnormal spindle (D, E) or highly condensed and disorganized DNA (F,G), and normal nucleus from embryo produced by mtrm126 + polo16-1/+ endos00003 + female (H) are shown. Scale bar, 5 \xce\xbcm. The reduced fertility of mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 females could result from defects in oocyte meiosis, early embryonic mitoses, or a combination of both. endos00003 homozygous females have a prolonged prophase I arrest, and Endos positively regulates Polo protein expression levels (Von Stetina et al. 2008). mtrm126/+ heterozygous females have premature meiotic maturation, and Mtrm binds to Polo and inhibits its activity (Xiang et al. 2007). Analyzing DNA morphology as previously described (Von Stetina et al. 2008; see Figure 1), we observed that a small but significant percentage of oocytes from mtrm126/+ females are released from the prophase I arrest slightly prematurely (see \xe2\x80\x9cEarly St. 13\xe2\x80\x9d in Figure 3A); this result is consistent with but not as pronounced as previously reported (Xiang et al. 2007). Conversely, a fraction of endos00003/+ heterozygous oocytes shows prolonged prophase I arrest (see \xe2\x80\x9cMid St. 13\xe2\x80\x9d in Figure 3A); this phenotype is in agreement with the more severe prolongation of prophase I in endos00003 homozygotes (Von Stetina et al. 2008). mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 double heterozygotes show an intermediate phenotype, with some oocytes leaving prophase I slightly prematurely and others remaining in prophase I longer (Figure 3A). endos and mtrm do not show genetic interactions during oocyte meiosis. (A) Quantification of percentage of oocytes remaining in prophase I at stages 12, early 13, mid 13, and late 13 and 14 of oogenesis. Numbers of oocytes analyzed for y w control, endos00003/+, mtrm126/+, and mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 are as follows, respectively. Stage 12: 69, 56, 68, 41; early stage 13: 101, 163, 171, 109; mid stage 13: 27, 92, 65, 61; late stage 13: 128, 247, 189, 265; stage 14: 106, 239, 312, 773. (B) Quantification of percentage of stage 14 oocytes showing abnormal DNA morphology. Numbers of oocytes analyzed for y w control, endos00003/+, mtrm126/+, and mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 are 106, 239, 312, and 773, respectively. *P = 0.002. **P = 0.0005. ***P = 1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9214. ns, no significant difference. (C\xe2\x80\x93E) Examples of stage 14 oocyte DNA morphology for control (C, normal), mtrm126 (D, abnormal) and mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 (E, abnormal). Scale bar, 5 \xce\xbcm. endos00003 homozygous females do not progress to metaphase I and show a dispersed DNA morphology in stage 14 oocytes (Von Stetina et al. 2008), and mtrm126/+ heterozygous stage 14 oocytes have mispositioned chromosomes, resulting in a high frequency of nondisjunction (Xiang et al. 2007). We therefore also examined genetic interactions between endos and mtrm in stage 14 oocytes. The vast majority of control and endos00003/+ heterozygous oocytes displayed typical metaphase I morphology (Figure 3, B and C; also see Figure 1B\xe2\x80\xb2, B\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2). mtrm126/+ heterozygotes displayed a high frequency of oocytes containing misarranged chromosome masses (Figure 3, B and D), consistent with reported non-disjunction defects (Xiang et al. 2007). Removal of one copy of endos did not suppress or enhance the abnormal stage 14 DNA morphology of mtrm126/+ heterozygous oocytes (Figure 3, B and E). Taken together, these results suggest that endos00003 and mtrm126 do not have significant genetic interactions during meiotic maturation. As described previously, the fertility of mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 double-heterozygous females is markedly reduced relative to that of single heterozygotes. In accordance, embryos produced by mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 females have a very reduced hatch rate (1.3%) relative to those produced by y w control (90%), endos00003 heterozygous (94%), or mtrm126 heterozygous (74%) females (Figure 4A). Because meiosis does not appear to be significantly disrupted in double heterozygotes (Figure 3), we instead examined the early mitoses of embryos laid by these females (Figure 4, B\xe2\x80\x93D). Most of the embryos laid by y w control (91%) or endos00003 heterozygous (95%) females had normal DNA and spindle morphology (Figure 4, B and C). A sizeable fraction of embryos from mtrm126 heterozygous females had DNA morphology defects and abnormal spindles during early mitoses (61% normal; Figure 4B), consistent with the slightly reduced hatch rate of these embryos (Figure 4A). Early mitosis defects, however, were significantly more severe in embryos derived from mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 double-heterozygous females (only 19% normal; Figure 4, B and D\xe2\x88\x92G). These results indicate that mtrm and endos genetically interact in the maternal control of early embryonic mitoses. endos and mtrm have distinct effects on Polo. endos00003 homozygous females have reduced levels of Polo expression in stage 14 oocytes (Von Stetina et al. 2008), and Mtrm is thought to bind to Polo stoichiometrically and inhibit its activity (Xiang et al. 2007). The effect of mtrm on polo function is dosage sensitive because mtrm126/+ heterozygous females have increased meiotic nondisjunction, and this phenotype is rescued by removal of one copy of polo and partially phenocopied by an extra copy of polo (Xiang et al. 2007). Accordingly, halving the dosage of polo also suppresses the decreased hatch rates of embryos derived from mtrm126/+ heterozygous females (Figure 4). We therefore reasoned that the strong genetic interaction between endos and mtrm during early embryonic mitoses might result from alterations in polo function. Indeed, removal of one copy of polo (polo16-1/+) in mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 double-heterozygous females completely restored normal embryonic hatch rates and early mitoses (Figure 4, A, B, and H), whereas introducing one extra copy of polo (GFP::polo; +/+) resulted in very low hatch rates of embryos from both mtrm126/+ and mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 females (Figure 4, A and B). These results provide strong genetic evidence to support the model that early embryos produced by mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 females have abnormally high Polo activity, leading to abnormal mitoses. Our observations that maternal mtrm interacts with endos to control early embryonic mitoses were initially surprising because Mtrm expression had been reported to be greatly reduced by stage 13 of oogenesis, based on immunofluorescence assays (Xiang et al. 2007). Because antibody penetration often presents a challenge for immunofluorescence detection in later stages of oogenesis, we examined Mtrm expression by Western blotting analyses of staged egg chambers. In y w control females, Mtrm is very highly expressed in stages 13 and 14 of oogenesis (Figure 5A). The band recognized by the antibody indeed corresponds to Mtrm, as it is not present in mtrm126 homozygous stage 14 oocytes (Figure 5B). These results indicate that Mtrm protein is maternally loaded into early embryos. endos is required for maternal expression of Mtrm. (A) Western blot showing Mtrm protein expression at different stages of oogenesis in y w control, endos00003, twe1, or elgi1 homozygous females. g-St. 11, germarium through stage 11; St. 12, stage 12; St. 13, stage 13; St. 14, stage 14. Actin was used as a loading control. One hundred egg chambers (or g-St.11 sets) were loaded per lane. (B) Mtrm Western blot of y w control, mtrm126, endos00003, and elgi1 stage 14 oocytes. Tubulin was used as a loading control. We were unable to examine Mtrm levels in elgi1 endos00003 double homozygous females due to the poor health of this genotype. (C) Model for genetic interaction between endos and mtrm. In wild-type females (Control), Endos promotes expression of Mtrm, a known negative regulator of Polo, during oogenesis resulting in normal levels of Polo function in the early embryo. In mtrm126/+ heterozygous females, reduced levels of maternal Mtrm loaded into the embryo lead to increased Polo activity and abnormal embryonic mitoses. Removal of one copy of endos in mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 double heterozygous females results in early embryos with further reduced levels of Mtrm, leading to even higher levels of Polo activity and more severe defects during early embryonic mitoses. Removal of one copy of endos strongly enhances the early mitosis defects of embryos produced by mtrm126/+ heterozygotes (see Figure 4), and Endos regulates the levels of several cell-cycle regulators in mature oocytes, including Polo, Twine (Twe), and Cyclin A (Von Stetina et al. 2008; J. R. Von Stetina and D. Drummond-Barbosa, unpublished data). We therefore tested whether endos might control the expression of Mtrm during oogenesis. In endos00003 homozygous females, Mtrm levels in earlier stages of egg chamber development are comparable with those of controls. In contrast, endos00003 homozygous stage 13 and 14 oocytes show markedly reduced levels of Mtrm (Figure 5, A and B). Endos and Elgi, a predicted E3 ubiquitin ligase, physically interact in vitro, and antagonize each other in vivo (Von Stetina et al. 2008). Although elgi is not involved in the degradation of Polo or Twe (Von Stetina et al. 2008), we tested whether Elgi might control Mtrm levels. elgi1 homozygous females, however, did not have increased levels of Mtrm in stages 13 and 14 (Figure 5, A and B). These results suggest that Elgi is not a major regulator of Mtrm levels in mature oocytes and that endos likely regulates Mtrm levels via a separate pathway. Indeed, we observed a reduction in Mtrm levels in oocytes of females mutant for twe (twe1; Figure 5A), which encodes a positive regulator of Cdk1, suggesting that the effects of endos on Mtrm expression might at least in part be a consequence of reduced phosphorylation of Cdk1 substrates. Based on our data, we speculate that mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 double heterozygous females have sufficient Polo expression to complete meiosis. However, the lower mtrm gene dosage combined with the further reduction in Mtrm expression caused by endos heterozygosity substantially reduces the levels of this dose-sensitive stoichiometric regulator of Polo, leading to abnormally high Polo activity levels and severe early mitoses defects (Figure 5C). We had previously identified endos as a key regulator of meiotic maturation and early embryonic mitoses (Von Stetina et al. 2008), and our genetic screen in this study identified several genomic intervals that dominantly interact with endos00003/+ to produce strong sterility or viability defects. These results suggest that endos plays multiple roles during the cell cycle throughout development and that its effects are complex and dosage dependent. Evidence from its vertebrate homolog (Gharbi-Ayachi et al. 2010; Mochida et al. 2010) suggests that Endos may act as a small regulatory protein that represses PP2A to promote entry into mitosis and meiotic maturation, and a recent study provides genetic support for this model in Drosophila (Rangone et al. 2011). It is conceivable that Endos binds additional cell cycle proteins to modulate their activity in a similar fashion. We uncovered mtrm, which encodes a stoichiometric inhibitor of Polo kinase, as a strong dominant enhancer of endos. Double heterozygosity of endos and mtrm induced severe sterility mostly as the result of defects in early embryonic mitoses. By reducing the gene dosage of polo we completely rescued the fertility defects of mtrm126 +/+ endos00003 females, indicating that the primary cause of this sterility phenotype is excessive Polo activity. Although we previously showed that Endos positively controls Polo protein levels during meiosis (Von Stetina et al. 2008), these data suggest that later, during early embryonic mitoses, maternal endos antagonizes Polo activity through its effects on Mtrm expression during oocyte development (Figure 5C). We thus propose that Endos is required during late stages of oogenesis to promote high levels of Mtrm protein to be loaded into early embryos for the proper stoichiometric balance between Mtrm and Polo, which is essential for normal mitoses in early embryogenesis (Figure 5C). The early syncytial embryo is particularly sensitive to the balance between specific cell-cycle regulators. For example, a balance between Gwl kinase and Polo activities has been proposed to be crucial for early embryonic mitoses (Archambault et al. 2007). Embryos derived from females heterozygous for both polo and Scant, a putative hyperactive allele of gwl, are not viable because of a significant loss or detachment of centrosomes, and this phenotype is rescued by increased maternal polo dosage. These studies led to the conclusion that excessive Gwl activity relative to Polo results in defects in the early syncytial embryo. Interestingly, the authors proposed that phosphorylation of an intermediate substrate by Gwl mediates its inhibitory effect since Gwl does not phosphorylate Polo (Archambault et al. 2007). Given that vertebrate Endos is phosphorylated and activated by Gwl (Gharbi-Ayachi et al. 2010; Mochida et al. 2010), and this also appears to be the case in Drosophila (Rangone et al. 2011), it is tempting to speculate that Gwl acts upstream of Endos to control Mtrm expression during late oogenesis and thereby antagonizes Polo in the early embryo. Endos controls the expression of multiple key regulators of the cell cycle, including Polo, Twe/Cdc25, and Cyclin A (Von Stetina et al. 2008; J. R. Von Stetina and D. Drummond-Barbosa, unpublished data), and in this study we found that Mtrm expression also requires endos function. Although it is formally possible that Endos might control the expression of other proteins via the predicted E3 ubiquitin ligase Elgi, Elgi does not appear to mediate the degradation of Polo, Twe or Mtrm in endos mutant females. Instead, it is conceivable that endos might regulate the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which controls the degradation of multiple cell-cycle regulators (Peters 2006). Future studies should address functional interactions between the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and endos. Our data uncovering a zygotic role for endos suggests that it may not only function during meiosis or specialized S-M early ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mbryonic mitoses but also act as a general regulator of the cell-cycle machinery. This idea is consistent with a recent study showing that endos is zygotically required during Drosophila development for neuroblast proliferation (Rangone et al. 2011), and with the recently identified roles for endos in chromosome alignment and spindle assembly (Goshima et al. 2007), the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint (Kondo and Perrimon 2011), and with the PP2A inhibitory function of vertebrate Endos (Gharbi-Ayachi et al. 2010; Mochida et al. 2010). The molecular identification of the specific genes interacting with endos in both sterile and lethal combinations will help us better understand how Endos controls the cell-cycle machinery and how Endos is regulated during the cell cycle. Based on the evolutionary conservation of Endos and its cell-cycle functions, this knowledge will likely be of broad relevance. J.R.V.S. and D.D.-B. designed and interpreted experiments.

Isolates typically arrived on agar slopes or as freeze-dried samples. If they were freeze dried, then the yeast was reconstituted with water and streaked onto supplemented yeast extract agar plates; (YES; 5% yeast extract, 3% glucose, 225 mg/L histidine, 225 mg/L adenine, 225 mg/L leucine, and 225 mg/L uracil), 2% agar Bacto agar (Becton Dickinson). Strains were maintained either on YES agar or cultured in liquid YES. Filter transfer, hybridization analysis, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis were carried out as previously described (Brown 1988; Brown et al. 1990). PCR was carried using Taq polymerase (homemade or from Yorkshire Biosciences). Sanger sequencing was carried out using BigDye v3.1 (Applied Biosystems). Primers used to construct probes for filter hybridization are given in supporting information, Table S3. DNA for PCR was extracted from the 5 mL of yeast cultures using a protocol kindly supplied by Jacob Dalgaard of the Marie Curie Research Institute. Five milliliters of saturated culture was concentrated by centrifugation; spheroplasted using zymolyase 20T in 100 \xce\xbcl 1M sorbitol and 50 mM EDTA; concentrated by centrifugation once again; resuspended in 0.2 mL of DNAzol; and vortex mixed. The DNA was precipitated with an equal volume of cold ethanol. The crude DNA was treated with ribonuclease and then pronase in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS; extracted between three and five times with a 1:1 mixture of phenol and chloroform; and finally precipitated with ethanol prior to use. Primers used to amplify and sequence DNA for diversity analysis are listed in Table S4. DNA was amplified with Taq polymerase in an ammonium chloride buffer containing 2 mM MgCl2 using the following conditions: an initial denaturation step of 92\xc2\xb0 for 30 sec was followed by 33 cycles of 92\xc2\xb0 for 10 sec, 56\xc2\xb0 for 10 sec, and 65\xc2\xb0 for 2 min. Primers and unincorporated dNTP were removed from the reactions using Ampure (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter), the products were sequenced on each strand using the primers described above using BigDye (v2 or v3.1; Applied Biosystems), and then purified prior to electrophoretic analysis by Cleanseq (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter). Sequences were aligned and edited using Bioedit and collapsed into haplotypes using FaBox (http://www.birc.au.dk/~biopv/php/fabox/). Sequences that defined unique haplotypes at any one locus were reamplified and resequenced. Standard summary statistics were extracted with Arlequin (Excoffier et al. 2005) and DNASp (Librado and Rozas 2009). DNA for pulsed field gel electrophoresis was embedded in agarose plugs and extracted as described (Smith et al. 1987). For microarray analysis, chromosomal DNA was size-fractionated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, electroeluted from the gel into dialysis tubing, concentrated using Butan-2-ol, amplified by the Qiagen REPL1-g mini kit before labeling using the Agilent DNA ULS labeling kit (5190-0419), and then purified and hybridized to the Agilent S. pombe 4 \xc3\x97 44K ChIP-on-chip array (G4810) using unfractionated CRUK 972 DNA as competitor. In some experiments, unfractionated DNA from natural isolates was used as target. All steps were carried out according to the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. Arrays were scanned using an Agilent Scanner, and the data were analyzed using the Agilent Genomic Workbench v5.0.14. Strains were subjected to high-throughput phenotyping by microcultivation (n = 2) in an array of environments essentially as described (Warringer et al. 2008; Warringer and Blomberg 2003). Briefly, strains were inoculated in 350 \xc2\xb5l of YES medium (5% yeast extract, 3% glucose, 225 mg/L histidine, 225 mg/L adenine, 225 mg/L leucine, and 225 mg/L uracil) and incubated in two serial rounds of precultivation for 48\xe2\x80\x9372 h at 30\xc2\xb0. For experimental runs, strains were inoculated to an OD of 0.05\xe2\x80\x930.1 in 350 \xc2\xb5l of YES medium (3% glucose was replaced by 3% of alternative carbon sources where indicated) and microcultivated for 48 h or 72 h in a Bioscreen analyzer C (Oy Growth Curves, Finland). Optical density was measured every 20 min using a wide band (450\xe2\x80\x93580 nm) filter. The mitotic proliferation rate (population doubling time), lag (population adaptation time), and efficiency (total change in population density) were extracted from high-density growth curves and LN (natural logarithm)\xe2\x80\x93transformed (data set in Table S5). Relative fitness variable for each strain and trait, LSCij, was calculated as:where wtkj is the fitness variable of the kth measurement of the wild-type for trait j; xij is the measure of strain i for trait j; and r indicates the run. The measure for proliferation efficiency was inverted to maintain directionality between fitness components. Cells were cultured over night in YES containing glucose at 0.5% weight per volume until they reached mid-log phase, concentrated by centrifugation, and visualized using phase microscopy using a Zeiss Axioscop microscope with a Plan NeoFluor 40\xc3\x97 objective. Images were collected and sizes were quantitated using Metamorph (Universal Imaging) v6.1. The SPBC660.16 large intron (which encodes phosphogluconate dehydrogease), TER1, and CEN2 sequences were stripped of indels and, in the case of the large intron of SPBC 660.16, the microsatellite; concatenated; and then grouped according to geographic origin. Fst values (Cockerham and Weir 1984) were estimated using the Arlequin package (Excoffier et al. 2005). Informative SNPs were identified both in the centromere of chromosome 2 (Figure S6) and in the flanking DNA (Figure S7) and in the TER1 gene and in the flanking DNA (Figure S8) and used to estimate linkage disequilibrium (LD) statistics using DNAsp (Table 5). We started our project by assembling a collection of 84 S. pombe strains (Figure 1, Table 1, and Table S1). Of these strains, 81 were natural isolates and 3 were listed as laboratory strains. We first checked the ploidy by DNA staining with Cytox green and fluorescence flow cytometry; this showed that all of the strains but one (NCYC 2355) were haploid. We therefore subcloned NCYC 2355 and isolated three haploid clones. We analyzed two of these clones using the methods described below; they were identical, so we refer to one: NCYC 2355-1. We characterized the 84 haploid strains by sequence and phenotype. We initially sequenced three segments of the genome that did not code for proteins: a segment of the central core of chromosome II (II: 1,621,085\xe2\x80\x931,621,800); the gene encoding the RNA component of telomerase, TER1 (I: 3,084,446\xe2\x80\x933,086,143); and the second intron (the largest intron in the S. pombe genome, II: 230,740\xe2\x80\x93231,501) of gene SPBC660.16-1, which encodes phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. To establish a preliminary estimate of the levels of outcrossing (see below), we also sequenced two loci that flanked the centromere of chromosome II (II: 1,572,330\xe2\x80\x931,572,988 and 1,658,033\xe2\x80\x931,658,751) and two loci centromere distal of the TER1 gene (I: 3,113,975\xe2\x80\x933,114,540 and I: 3,194,538\xe2\x80\x933,195,201). In total, we sequenced and analyzed 5,777 bp in 84 strains. The results established that many of the isolates were closely related and that the entire collection could be reduced to 40 identical haplotypes (Table 1). The strains with identical haplotypes either had a widespread distribution or were collected close to one another. Haplotypes with a widespread distribution could have spread around the world by natural mechanisms or as result of human activity. The geographically restricted haplotypes may represent clones that had reached a high frequency because of founder effects or population bottlenecks, or it may have arisen from restricted collection activity. Geographic origin of the 84 strains of Schizosaccharomyes pombe used in this study. The area of the circles is proportionate to the numbers of strains from the respective areas. We used sequence data to analyze the diversity and population structure of S. pombe. To minimize the consequences of biased collecting activities or human trade, we carried out this analysis using the diversity contained within the 40 different haplotypes identified in Table 1 and Table S2. The diversity \xcf\x80 (Table 2) detected at each of the three nonprotein-coding loci varies with the highest value being observed at the locus most likely to approach neutrality, the central core of the centromere of chromosome II. A negative value of Tajima\xe2\x80\x99s D suggests recent selection at or close to the region of the SPBC 660.16 intron. The value of \xcf\x80 of 7 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923 seen at the central core of chromosome II is consistent with the variation seen in pairwise comparison of 4-fold degenerate sites between the laboratory strain and strains NCYC 132 and SPK 1820, which gave values of 8.9 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923 and 6.7 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923 (Rhind et al. 2011), respectively, so we concluded that this estimate is correct. This is slightly higher than in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, which has a value of 5.65 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923 (Liti et al. 2009). The fact that all but one of the strains are haploid and the assumption of a neutral coalescent allows estimation of the effective mitotic population size Ne by use of relationship \xcf\x80 = 2Neu, where u is the mutation rate per nucleotide per mitotic generation (Tsai et al. 2008). The neutral mutation rate in S. pombe is not known, so we assumed the rate that has been used for S. cerevisiae of 0.33 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x929/bp/generation (Lynch et al. 2008), leading to an estimate of the global effective population size of 1 \xc3\x97 107. It is also of interest to know how much variation is endemic to particular population. There was too little sequence variation to be able to estimate population structure a priori using the Bayesian approaches implemented in the STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 2000) and BAPS (Corander et al. 2008) packages, so we grouped the haplotypes according to their geographic origin, where this was possible, and then analyzed them using the F statistic (Cockerham and Weir 1984). These results (Table 3) demonstrated little by way of population structure but suggested that the American strains were the most highly differentiated. Network analysis of the CEN2, TER, and 660.16 sequences was also consistent with extensive mixing between the different haplotypes (Figure S6, Figure S8, Figure S9, and Figure S10). Two loci include sufficient data to estimate the extent of linkage disequilibrium, which is inversely proportional to the out-crossing rate. To do this, we identified informative SNPs in and around the centromere of chromosome II and within and centromere distal of the TER1 gene (Figure S6, Figure S7, Figure S8, Figure S9, and Figure S10). A four gamete test of the sequence variation around the centromere does not indicate recombination. Significant linkage disequilibrium is also detectable 30 kb from the telomerase RNA gene using both the D' and R statistics (Table 4). The extent of linkage disequilibrium would seem, therefore, to be greater than in S. paradoxus (Tsai et al. 2008), which out-crosses once in every 1000 asexual generations and which shows lower levels of nucleotide diversity. Network analysis (Figure S6, Figure S9, and Figure S10) of the haplotypes at centromere II, TER1, and SPBC660.16, however, demonstrate that there is extensive mixing between different strains. More detailed analysis will be required to measure the rate of out-crossing in S. pombe and to correlate it with the karyotypic diversity described below. To survey natural trait variation in S. pombe, isolates were subjected to high-resolution quantification of proliferative ability in an array of environments representing variations in nutrient availability, temperature, and exposure to toxic metals and drugs. From high-density mitotic growth curves, the fitness components lag of proliferation, rate of proliferation (population doubling time), and efficiency of proliferation (population density change) were extracted, providing >120 distinct measures of organism-environment interactions (Figure 2). These fitness components were compared with those of the S. cerevisiae universal type strain BY4741. In optimal conditions, S. pombe featured a delay in the time to initiate population growth and a marginal reduction in proliferation rate relative S. cerevisiae (Figure S1, A and B). In contrast, the performance of S. pombe was very severely impaired in many stress-inducing environments (Figure 2B). In particular, S. pombe proliferation in the presence of alkali and alkaline earth metals, DNA damaging agents, and respiratory or partially respiratory carbon sources was reduced (Figure 2B and Figure S1D). Utilization of maltose, the main storage carbohydrate of barley, represented an exception, being more efficient in S. pombe (Figure S1, D and E). Overall, trait variation in S. pombe was lower than what has been reported both for the variable S. cerevisiae and its less variable wild relative S. paradoxus (Warringer et al. 2011) (Figure S2A). This suggests that S. pombe is adapted for proliferating in a more constrained ecological range than the baker\xe2\x80\x99s yeasts. Nevertheless, trait variation largely followed phylogenetic boundaries as defined by haplotype structure and geographic origin: strains with the same haplotype or the same geographic origin were significantly (Student t-test, P < E\xe2\x88\x9234) more similar than other strains (Figure 2B\xe2\x80\x93D). In addition, we surveyed cell length at septation and found the influence of the haplotype structure to prevail for this trait (Figure 3). The most phenotypically distinct S. pombe populations were the American population, with an impaired proliferation at high temperatures, and the European population, with a prolonged lag phase when initiating respiratory proliferation as well as elevated tolerance to DNA damage (Figure S2B). The strain CBS 2777 stands out in terms of mitotic fitness traits, and it emerges as one of the most atypical strains (Figure 2E and Figure S3A). CBS 2777 is a strain with the unusual karyotype of four chromosomes (see below). CBS 2777 deviated from the S. pombe mean in more than 14% of all traits (Student t-test, FDR 5%). Most of these abnormalities represented severe proliferation deficiencies, notably the inability to tolerate DNA-damaging drugs, such as cisplatin and 4-nitroquinolone, that strain DNA replication and repair (Figure 2, G and F and Figure S3B). These abnormalities were evident also in relation to CBS2775 and CBS2776, which share haplotype, but not karyotype, structure with CBS2777. Trait variation in S. pombe is defined by population structure and geographic origin. (A) The proliferative lag (time to initiate proliferation), proliferative rate (population doubling time), and proliferative efficiency (change in population density) were extracted from high-density growth curves (n = 2) of natural S. pombe isolates (N = 2) over 42 environments. (B) Hierarchical clustering of S. pombe natural isolates was performed using trait profiles based on all traits, a centered Pearson correlation metric, and average linkage mapping. Numbers indicate haplotype groups and color indicates geographic origin. Heat map depicts proliferation relative the S. cerevisiae universal type strain BY4741 (Log2 [isolate/BY4741]).

Strains showing typical S. pombe behavior in these environments are included for comparison. Variation in length at septation among natural isolates of S. pombe. S. pombe isolates were cultured to mid-exponential phase of growth, harvested, and then analyzed by phase contrast microscopy. The individual isolates are arranged on the abscissa according to their respective haplotypes, with isolates of the same haplotype placed adjacent to one another and accorded the same color (alternating gray or yellow). The red arrow indicates the S. pombe reference strains 972 h\xe2\x88\x92 and 975 h+. The laboratory strain of S. pombe possesses three chromosomes. Each centromere includes two blocks of tandemly repeated heterochromatic sequences that are arranged palindromically around an A+T rich central core. There is extensive sequence homology between the six blocks of tandemly repeated centromeric DNA, suggesting the possibility of polymorphism arising either from exchange between the arrays of repeats at different centromeres or from instability of individual centromeric palindromes. In light of this potential polymorphism, we analyzed the chromosomes by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, filter transfer, and hybridization using a set of single-copy probes that lie centromere proximal and distal on the six arms of the laboratory strain karyotype and with a probe for the ribosomal DNA (rDNA), which occupies a subtelomeric position at the ends of the two arms of chromosome III. Simple ethidium bromide staining of the pulsed field gels showed that four African isolates (Y468, Y470, Y831, and Y832) were mixtures of different karyotypes and were subcloned. One of the isolates (CBS 374), which gave ambiguous results upon first pulsed field gel analysis, was also subcloned. Together these subclones defined 15 additional strains, which we define as NOTT 133\xe2\x80\x93145, NOTT 147, and NOTT 148. We subsequently sequenced these subclones at the most informative (as defined by number of haplotypes) of the seven loci that we had sequenced in the original set of 84 strains (SPBC660.0.16, TER1, and the central core of the centromere of chromosome II), and we confirmed that they were isogenic with respect to the original uncloned isolates. The pulsed field gel and filter hybridization analysis identified three types of gross chromosome rearrangement. Four isolates (UWOPS 94.422.2, DBVPG 2805, DBVPG 6417, and DBVPG 6281) had karyotypes in which the rDNA was rearranged. The nature of these rearrangements was analyzed as shown in Figure 4A to produce the ideograms shown in Figure 4B. Each of these rearrangements was unique in the collection. The conclusion we draw is that S. pombe shows extensive exchange of subtelomeric DNA sequences, including rDNA. It is striking that the sequences that are exchanged between the chromosomes extend hundreds of kilobases into single-copy, chromosome-specific DNA. It is also notable that there is extensive size variation between chromosomes not detectably involved in the translocation of the rDNA arrays. The cause of this variation remains to be determined but may include translocations and exchanges of subtelomeric DNA that our analyses failed to detect. The second type of rearrangement involved sequences normally present on chromosomes I and II of the laboratory strain. To facilitate discussion, we refer to these types of rearranged chromosomes using Arabic numerals, with the largest chromosome in any one strain termed chromosome 1. We identified six different rearrangements of this type. One of these rearrangements was present in what is referred to as the S. pombe type strain CBS 356 (Figure 5A) and in five other strains (NCYC 132, NCYC 535, DBVPG 2817, DBVPG 4437, and AWRI 141) that have a widespread distribution over the old world and Australia (Table 1, Figure S4). These strains together defined haplotype 16, which includes specific locus haplotypes at the three loci in and around CEN2 and at the large intron of SPBC 660.16. The widespread distribution of the strains with this haplotype suggests that the karyotype variant is long standing relative to the other rearrangements, and thus, haplotype 16 karyotype may define an incipient species. The other translocations were detected in single strains (NOTT 138, NOTT 140, NOTT 142, NOTT 143, and NOTT 145), all of which were derived by subcloning three African isolates. We analyzed all of these rearranged karyotypes first by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, then by filter transfer and hybridization (Figure 5A), and then for two of the karyotypes, NOTT 143 and NOTT 145, by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of gel-purified chromosomes to microarrays (Figure 5B), followed by PCR analysis and sequencing (File S1) across hypothetical breakpoints to produce the maps shown in Figure 5C. These demonstrate features held in common by the two rearrangements, first they are both translocations, and second, they both share a 2,227,883 bp pericentric inversion with respect to chromosome I of the laboratory strain. PCR showed that this inversion is present in all of the strains in the collection with the exception of DBVPG 2805, DBVPG 6610, DBVPG 4433, DBVPG 6279, DBVPG 6699, CRUK 972, and CRUK 975. These strains belong to haplotype 18 or the closely related haplotype 25. However, these strains have a widespread distribution, which suggested that the laboratory strain arrangement and possibly other rearrangements on a shared background are acting as barriers to fertile mating. Sequencing across the inversion and translocation breakpoints (File S1, and Figure S5) showed only microhomology in two of five sequences involved in the exchanges. Repetitive sequences were absent. This fact that the 2.23 Mb inversion was present in a minority of strains also suggested that the sequence arrangement in the laboratory strain was a derived trait, which we confirmed by comparison with the arrangement of the homologous sequences in S. octosporus and S. cryophilus (not shown). Pulsed field gel and filter hybridization analysis (Figure 5A) indicated that the rearrangements in NOTT 140 and 142 were also simple reciprocal translocations, and they were not characterized further. Filter hybridization and CGH microarray analysis showed that CBS 356 and NOTT 138 also contained translocations or transpositions, but in both cases, one of the two partner chromosomes was not detectably rearranged when analyzed by CGH on microarrays (not shown). The simplest explanation for these results is that one of the breakpoints is close to a telomere. Rearrangement of the S. pombe karyotype by translocations of the rDNA and associated sequences. (A) DNA extracted from five different natural isolates (UWOPS 94.422.2, DBVPG 6281, DBVPG 6417, DBVPG 6449, and DBVPG 2805) and from laboratory strain CRUK 972 was size-fractionated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and then analyzed by filter hybridization with centromere proximal and distal probes from each of the six arms of the three chromosomes and with a probe derived from rDNA. The figure illustrates the original ethidium bromide-stained gels and the results of the filter hybridization. Four isolates had karyotypes in which the rDNA was rearranged. In UWOPS 94.422.2, the rDNA is translocated in its entirety onto chromosome I. In DBVPG 2805, the rDNA on the right arm of the laboratory strain chromosome III is translocated together with the distal IIIR sequence onto chromosome I, and distal IR sequence is translocated onto chromosome III. In DBVPG6417, distal IIIL sequences are translocated onto chromosome II, and distal IIR sequences are translocated onto chromosome III. DBVPG 6281 appears to be a derivative of DBVPG 6417 as the rDNA is now present on chromosome I and distal IL sequences are present on chromosome II. (B) An ideogrammatic interpretation of these results together with an indication of the approximate positions of the probes used in the filter hybridization. Rearrangement of the S. pombe karyotype by translocations between chromosomes I and II. (A) DNA extracted from seven different natural isolates (CBS 356, CBS2777, NOTT 136, NOTT 140, NOTT 142, NOTT 143, and NOTT 145) and laboratory strain CRUK 972 was size-fractionated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and then analyzed after transfer by filter hybridization with centromere proximal and distal probes from each of the six arms of the three chromosomes and with probes for the centromeric dGdH repeat and the central core of chromosome II. The figure illustrates the original ethidium bromide-stained gels and the results of the filter hybridization. (B) DNA was extracted from strains NOTT 143 and NOTT 145, size fractionated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and analyzed together with unfractionated DNA by CGH using Agilent 44K ChIP on CHIP arrays using unfractionated DNA from the laboratory strain CRUK 975 as competitor. In the case of NOTT 145, chromosomes 2 and 3 are very similar in size; there is cross contamination in the CGH experiments, but this does not obscure the details of the translocation between sequences that normally reside on chromosomes I and II. (C) Ideogrammatic representation of the CGH results together with an indication of the approximate positions of the probes used in the filter hybridization. Also indicated is the position of the 2.3 Mb pericentric inversion of sequences with respect to laboratory strain chromosome I. This inversion is present in both NOTT 143, as indicated by the results of the CGH experiments, and NOTT 143, as indicated by the results of PCR analysis. For a detailed discussion of the experimental approaches needed to define the rearrangements, see File S1. In addition to the analyses of the chromosomal rearrangements in CBS 356, NOTT 138, NOTT 140, and NOTT 142, we carried out comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and microarray analysis CGH on unfractionated DNA of strains CRUK 972, NOTT 141, NOTT 143, NOTT 145, and CBS 2777 using CRUK 975 DNA as a competitor. This CGH analysis detected extensive regions of copy number variation (Table 5). Three of the eight regions that are amplified include genes that are involved in resistance to heavy metals, consistent with exposure to Bordeaux mixture (CuSO4/Ca(OH)2) used as a fungicide in vineyards. The strain CBS 2777 contained four chromosomes (Figure 5A). Preliminary pulsed field gel and filter hybridization analysis of intact chromosomal DNA demonstrated a complex pattern of sequence rearrangements. Detailed functional and structural analysis of this strain will be described elsewhere. In many organisms, natural isolates have been a source of variation for the analysis of pathways and processes of basic biological interest. In the short term, the aim of such studies is to increase knowledge of the components of these pathways and processes, whereas in the long term, the aim is to understand the architecture of a trait or feature at all levels from DNA to phenotype in terms of the ecology of the respective organism (Mackay et al. 2009). We initiated the study of the variation of S. pombe because this organism is easy and cheap to manipulate and analyze and because much is known about the cell biology of S. pombe. We showed that the amount of phenotypic ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ariation segregating in S. pombe is small in comparison to that seen, for example, in S. cerevisiae and that the existence of karyotypic rearrangements may limit access to some of it. We conclude that the variation that does exist (in size, for example) will need to be studied in a focused way. Our pulsed field gel-based approach is likely to have revealed the presence of only a subset of the translocations, inversions, and deletions segregating in the collection, and thus, a subset of strains, segregating a trait of particular interest, will need to be completely sequenced and characterized in terms of rearrangements. In light of the expense required to carry out such work, it would seem prudent to start with the most significant of the variable traits and characterize the strains segregating this variation first. Cell size is a feature of the biology of S. pombe that has been intensively studied, is of general biological importance, and shows clear evidence of variation among the different isolates. Such variation is also observed in budding yeast (Nogami et al. 2007). It may be that this variation is adaptively neutral, and the correlation between the size of particular haplotype and the source from which it is isolated that is observed in haplotypes 3 and 4 of Brazilian origin has arisen by drift. Alternatively, the variation may be adaptively significant and related to the fact that the strains were isolated from different environments: ca\xc3\xa7haca must (haplotype 3) or the frozen pulp of Eugenia uniflora (haplotye 4). A combination of experimental and ecological studies should discriminate between these alternative explanations and improve our understanding of this important aspect of cell physiology. Although karyotypic diversity will make it necessary to adapt and apply the approaches used to exploit diversity in other model organisms to S. pombe, karyotype diversity is itself of interest. Thus, an understanding of the karyotype diversity is essential if we are to understand the nucleotide diversity because inversion and translocations will limit exchange between segments of DNA and strains. Rearranged chromosomes have been useful as both genetic reagents and in terms of their ability to cast new and often unexpected perspectives on fundamental problems. Thus the discovery of strain CBS 2777 with four chromosomes poses interesting questions about the mechanism of formation of additional centromeres and telomeres. The unexpectedly high levels of karyotypic diversity that characterize S. pombe worldwide also require explanation in population genetic and mechanistic terms. The simplest explanation, at the population genetic level, is that S. pombe exists in small, rarely out-crossing populations that favor the accumulation of weakly deleterious mutations, including karyotypic rearrangements. This explanation is consistent with both the pattern of linkage distribution around CEN2 and TER1 and with the observation that most of the rearrangements occur once in the collection or are confined to single haplotypes (Table S2). Note, however, that our perspective on out-crossing is based on only two regions of the genome and the patterns of LD within these regions will in turn be sensitive to whether they include any common rearrangements. Genome-wide estimates of LD will thus also require a knowledge of the karyotype diversity. A second, and not exclusive, adaptive explanation for the high levels of karyotypic diversity at the population genetic level is suggested by the isogenic rearrangements isolated by subcloning the African strains Y468, Y470, Y831, and Y832. The fact that the substrains are isogenic at the sequence level, vary karyotypically, and are derived from the same isolates raises the possibility that adaptive radiation may be occurring within in a limited geographic area and that the rearrangements are acting to isolate variants adapted to different, specific subniches. Although it may be possible to investigate such hypothetical microspeciation, a potential limitation of this line of work is that the traits under selection may be significant only for yeast ecology (e.g. sugar utilization) and not of general interest as regards eukaryotic cell biology. However, it seems worthwhile to study this aspect of the biology of S. pombe because speciation is a problem of general interest that remains incompletely understood, and S. pombe offers the possibility of rigorous analysis and understanding. In this respect, our population level approach extends the comparative genomics analysis of four different Schizosaccharomyces species by Rhind et al. (2011). Deeper understanding at both levels should help cast light on the mode and tempo of speciation in Schizosaccharomyces spp. and, in particular, on the relative significance of karyotypic and gene incompatibility as isolating mechanisms in this genus (Greig 2009). It is clear from our analysis that our understanding of the origins and spread of S. pombe would be improved not only by more sequence data and data about the rearrangements segregating in the population but also by the collection and analysis of many more strains from around the world. S. pombe will grow at high concentrations of glucose and at low pH. An enrichment medium for S. pombe has been described (Florenzano et al. 1977). Thus, it may be possible to collect many more strains, although the ease with which this might be done is not yet clear. In particular, more strains from Africa and South and East Asia will be necessary to establish the geographic origins and phylogeny of the species. The success of the Brazilian collection expeditions suggests that it should be possible to isolate such strains. This work should also help define the range of environments that harbor S. pombe, provide additional karyotypic variants, and perhaps identify convenient locations for field work.

Highlighting this complexity is the observation that large genome-wide association experiments have implicated many genes with weak statistical support. Experimental model systems, cell culture and animal, have identified many genes and pathways involved in ethanol response, but their applicability to the development of alcohol use disorders in humans is undetermined. To overcome the limitations of any single experimental system, the analytical strategy used here was to identify genes that exert common phenotypic effects across multiple experimental systems. Specifically, we (1) performed a mouse linkage analysis to identify quantitative trait loci that influence ethanol-induced ataxia; (2) performed a human genetic association analysis of the mouse-identified loci against ethanol-induced body sway, a phenotype that is not only comparable to the mouse ethanol-ataxia phenotype but is also a genetically influenced endophenotype of alcohol use disorders; (3) performed behavioral genetic experiments in Drosophila showing that fly homologs of GPC5, the member of the glypican gene family implicated by both the human and mouse genetic analyses, influence the fly\xe2\x80\x99s response to ethanol; and (4) discovered data from the literature demonstrating that the genetically implicated gene\xe2\x80\x99s expression is not only temporally and spatially consistent with involvement in ethanol-induced behaviors but is also modulated by ethanol. The convergence of these data provides strong support to the hypothesis that GPC5 is involved in cellular and organismal ethanol response and the etiology of alcohol use disorders in humans.The etiology of alcohol use disorders (AUD) involves the interaction of many genetic, environmental and behavioral factors (Bierut 2011; Goldman et al. 2005; Kimura and Higuchi 2011). Two approaches have been taken to reduce this complexity and make the genetics of AUDs more experimentally tractable. Animal and cell models provide the simplest, most flexible experimental systems, but their relevance to the human disorder is a concern. In humans, efforts have been made to develop endophenotypes; simpler, intermediate phenotypes predictive of AUD development but more directly influenced by genetic variation (Gottesman and Gould 2003). One prominent AUD endophenotype is a low level of response (LR) to ethanol. Low LR is genetically influenced (Heath and Martin 1992; Madden et al. 1995; Martin et al. 1981) and predicative of later AUD development (Quinn and Fromme 2011; Schuckit and Smith 2000), and independent studies have demonstrated genetic association of alcohol dependence and ethanol LR to several polymorphisms, including the same nicotinic receptor locus (Joslyn et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008). Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have highlighted the genetic complexity of AUDs. Large surveys involving hundreds to thousands of subjects identified a single intergenic locus marked by rs7590720 that barely reached statistical significance after correcting for multiple tests (Bierut et al. 2010; Edenberg et al. 2010; Joslyn et al. 2010; Treutlein et al. 2009). A recent meta-analysis of over 45,000 individuals uncovered a different marker, rs6943555 in the AUTS2 gene, which just reaches statistical significance (Schumann et al. 2011). Such weak association results that explain a very small proportion of the heritability have been observed in other genetically influenced behavioral disorders. This has been interpreted to mean that the population genetic susceptibility is either expressed through a large number of alleles common in the population that individually confer a very small risk and/or alleles that confer a larger individual risk but are rare in the population and are thus not captured by association with the common SNPs used in GWA studies (Manolio et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2010). Theoretically, discovering such susceptibility alleles will require very large (hundreds of thousands) subject samples, combined with whole genome sequencing, to enable the genotyping of rare alleles. In practice, such surveys are years in the future: the samples must be collected; sequencing technology needs to further mature; and analysis methods need to be further developed. Cell and animal models used to evaluate the genetic contributions to AUD risk also face interpretational challenges. Cell culture models have demonstrated that gene expression and cellular signaling are altered by exposure to alcohol [reviewed by Moonat et al. (2010)]. While such in vitro studies enable experimental dissection of cellular ethanol response, it is not clear that the cellular stress response to a sublethal dose of ethanol shares mechanisms with human AUDs. Rodent models have been widely used because these animals can be taught complex alcohol-related behaviors that can then be manipulated and evaluated by pharmacological, genetic, and electrophysiological techniques [reviewed by Lovinger and Crabbe (2005) and Stuber et al. (2010)]. However, the applicability of the rodent behaviors to the human condition is difficult to establish. Invertebrate models of ethanol response, specifically Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, afford greater genetic manipulability than rodents (Wolf and Heberlein 2003), enabling detailed genetic pathways influencing the behavior to be constructed. However, even more so than rodent experiments, relating invertebrate behaviors to human ethanol response is challenging. In this article, we use a cross-species experimental analysis approach, reasoning that if multiple experimental models suggest the same mechanism, we have increased our chances of discovering an etiologically significant component of AUDs. To this end, we first analyzed mouse and human genetic data identifying a candidate gene putatively involved in ethanol response in both species. We then gained further experimental support for the candidate gene by determining whether functionally disruptive alleles of the Drosophila homologs alter the fly\xe2\x80\x99s response to ethanol. Through this approach, we identified GPC5, a member of the glypican gene family. Glypicans are well characterized as modulators of developmental signaling pathways, such as Wnts, Hedgehogs, and Bone Morphogenic Proteins [reviewed by Selleck (2000)]. Intriguingly, evidence is now accumulating that these same pathways participate not only in neural development but also in synaptic maintenance and plasticity, leading to the hypothesis that they are involved in the expression of behavioral phenotypes (Budnik and Salinas 2011; Far\xc3\xadas et al. 2010; Ille and Sommer 2005; Marqu\xc3\xa9s 2005; Okerlund and Cheyette 2011; Salinas 2005).'","b'Alcohol use disorders are influenced by many interacting genetic and environmental factors. Highlighting this complexity is the observation that large genome-wide association experiments have implicated many genes with weak statistical support. Experimental model systems, cell culture and animal, have identified many genes and pathways involved in ethanol response, but their applicability to the development of alcohol use disorders in humans is undetermined. To overcome the limitations of any single experimental system, the analytical strategy used here was to identify genes that exert common phenotypic effects across multiple experimental systems. Specifically, we (1) performed a mouse linkage analysis to identify quantitative trait loci that influence ethanol-induced ataxia; (2) performed a human genetic association analysis of the mouse-identified loci against ethanol-induced body sway, a phenotype that is not only comparable to the mouse ethanol-ataxia phenotype but is also a genetically influenced endophenotype of alcohol use disorders; (3) performed behavioral genetic experiments in Drosophila showing that fly homologs of GPC5, the member of the glypican gene family implicated by both the human and mouse genetic analyses, influence the fly\xe2\x80\x99s response to ethanol; and (4) discovered data from the literature demonstrating that the genetically implicated gene\xe2\x80\x99s expression is not only temporally and spatially consistent with involvement in ethanol-induced behaviors but is also modulated by ethanol. The convergence of these data provides strong support to the hypothesis that GPC5 is involved in cellular and organismal ethanol response and the etiology of alcohol use disorders in humans. The etiology of alcohol use disorders (AUD) involves the interaction of many genetic, environmental and behavioral factors (Bierut 2011; Goldman et al. 2005; Kimura and Higuchi 2011). Two approaches have been taken to reduce this complexity and make the genetics of AUDs more experimentally tractable. Animal and cell models provide the simplest, most flexible experimental systems, but their relevance to the human disorder is a concern. In humans, efforts have been made to develop endophenotypes; simpler, intermediate phenotypes predictive of AUD development but more directly influenced by genetic variation (Gottesman and Gould 2003). One prominent AUD endophenotype is a low level of response (LR) to ethanol. Low LR is genetically influenced (Heath and Martin 1992; Madden et al. 1995; Martin et al. 1981) and predicative of later AUD development (Quinn and Fromme 2011; Schuckit and Smith 2000), and independent studies have demonstrated genetic association of alcohol dependence and ethanol LR to several polymorphisms, including the same nicotinic receptor locus (Joslyn et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008). Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have highlighted the genetic complexity of AUDs. Large surveys involving hundreds to thousands of subjects identified a single intergenic locus marked by rs7590720 that barely reached statistical significance after correcting for multiple tests (Bierut et al. 2010; Edenberg et al. 2010; Joslyn et al. 2010; Treutlein et al. 2009). A recent meta-analysis of over 45,000 individuals uncovered a different marker, rs6943555 in the AUTS2 gene, which just reaches statistical significance (Schumann et al. 2011). Such weak association results that explain a very small proportion of the heritability have been observed in other genetically influenced behavioral disorders. This has been interpreted to mean that the population genetic susceptibility is either expressed through a large number of alleles common in the population that individually confer a very small risk and/or alleles that confer a larger individual risk but are rare in the population and are thus not captured by association with the common SNPs used in GWA studies (Manolio et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2010). Theoretically, discovering such susceptibility alleles will require very large (hundreds of thousands) subject samples, combined with whole genome sequencing, to enable the genotyping of rare alleles. In practice, such surveys are years in the future: the samples must be collected; sequencing technology needs to further mature; and analysis methods need to be further developed. Cell and animal models used to evaluate the genetic contributions to AUD risk also face interpretational challenges. Cell culture models have demonstrated that gene expression and cellular signaling are altered by exposure to alcohol [reviewed by Moonat et al. (2010)]. While such in vitro studies enable experimental dissection of cellular ethanol response, it is not clear that the cellular stress response to a sublethal dose of ethanol shares mechanisms with human AUDs. Rodent models have been widely used because these animals can be taught complex alcohol-related behaviors that can then be manipulated and evaluated by pharmacological, genetic, and electrophysiological techniques [reviewed by Lovinger and Crabbe (2005) and Stuber et al. (2010)]. However, the applicability of the rodent behaviors to the human condition is difficult to establish. Invertebrate models of ethanol response, specifically Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, afford greater genetic manipulability than rodents (Wolf and Heberlein 2003), enabling detailed genetic pathways influencing the behavior to be constructed. However, even more so than rodent experiments, relating invertebrate behaviors to human ethanol response is challenging. In this article, we use a cross-species experimental analysis approach, reasoning that if multiple experimental models suggest the same mechanism, we have increased our chances of discovering an etiologically significant component of AUDs. To this end, we first analyzed mouse and human genetic data identifying a candidate gene putatively involved in ethanol response in both species. We then gained further experimental support for the candidate gene by determining whether functionally disruptive alleles of the Drosophila homologs alter the fly\xe2\x80\x99s response to ethanol. Through this approach, we identified GPC5, a member of the glypican gene family. Glypicans are well characterized as modulators of developmental signaling pathways, such as Wnts, Hedgehogs, and Bone Morphogenic Proteins [reviewed by Selleck (2000)]. Intriguingly, evidence is now accumulating that these same pathways participate not only in neural development but also in synaptic maintenance and plasticity, leading to the hypothesis that they are involved in the expression of behavioral phenotypes (Budnik and Salinas 2011; Far\xc3\xadas et al. 2010; Ille and Sommer 2005; Marqu\xc3\xa9s 2005; Okerlund and Cheyette 2011; Salinas 2005). Finding a phenotype that is related to alcohol dependence (AD) and comparable across humans, mice, and flies was central to this analysis. While AD cannot be accurately modeled in mice and flies, acute response to ethanol ingestion is similar between these organisms, and in humans, alcohol response is predictive of later AUD development (Erblich and Earleywine 1999; Pollock 1992; Quinn and Fromme 2011; Schuckit and Smith 1996; Schuckit and Smith 2000; Schuckit et al. 2000; Schuckit et al. 1996). We compared locomotor responses to ethanol: body sway in humans, ataxia in mice, and locomotor activity in flies. BXD recombinant inbred mouse data were retrieved and analyses were performed using the WebQTL (www.genenetwork.org) data and analysis suite (Wang et al. 2003). GeneNetwork is an online data repository with integrated computational tools designed to allow users to explore complex genetic networks by integrating data from different sources. The BXD resource (a small subset of the collected data) contains over 2800 measured phenotypes, which were contributed by hundreds of scientists, all linked to genotypes, providing an easily accessible tool to genetically map traits of interest. Phenotypes were selected by searching the BXD phenotype database using the search strings \xe2\x80\x9cethanol AND ataxia\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9calcohol AND ataxia,\xe2\x80\x9d From the returned list of phenotypes, those that described ataxic response to the administration of ethanol were selected for interval mapping. Ethanol-induced ataxia QTL were mapped using the Interval Mapping module. A likelihood ratio statistic (LRS) was calculated for each marker using 1000 permutations. LRS values were converted to the log of the odds (LOD) ratio to be consistent with human genetic reporting norms: LOD = LRS/4.61. Mouse chromosomal intervals yielding suggestive linkage for an ethanol-induced ataxia phenotype had their human syntenic counterpart identified using data collected and presented by the comparative genomics functions of Ensembl (www.ensembl.org). The proximal- and distal-most markers exhibiting suggestive linkage defined the limits of mouse ethanol ataxia QTL. Using Ensembl\xe2\x80\x99s mouse genome reference NCBIM37, all genes, either wholly or partially within the defined QTL, were identified. Using the Ensembl comparative genomics module, the syntenic human genes (genome reference GRCh37) were identified. Human SNPs were selected for analysis if located within a syntenic gene as defined by its transcript plus 100 kb of flanking sequence. All analyzed genotypes were derived from the Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo DNA Analysis BeadChip. The human subjects genotyped and phenotyped in this study are part of the San Diego Sibling Pair investigation. Subjects were collected under a protocol approved by the Human Subjects Protection Committee of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and is described in greater detail elsewhere (Schuckit et al. 2005; Wilhelmsen et al. 2003). Participants, ages 18\xe2\x80\x9325, were selected from UCSD students who responded to a randomly mailed questionnaire and who met the following criteria: (1) had a minimum family size of two siblings, male or female, 18\xe2\x80\x9325 years old; (2) had consumed alcohol but had NEVER BEEN alcohol dependent; (3) had at least one parent who met the criteria for alcohol dependence using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association 2000); (4) had never met criteria for antisocial personality disorder or any DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric condition. In addition to collecting further questionnaire data, selected subjects were given an alcohol challenge in a laboratory setting to measure their responses to an approximately 0.75 ml/kg of ethanol consumed within 8\xe2\x80\x9310 min (dose was weight- and sex-adjusted to produce similar blood alcohol levels). Body sway was measured using a harness attached to the chest at the level of the axilla from which two perpendicular ropes extended forward and to the left side, passing over pulleys that measured the number of centimeters of movement per minute as gathered through three 1 min evaluations at each time point (Schuckit and Gold 1988). Anterior-posterior body sway (BSA) at the time of peak alcohol effect (60 min) was tested for genetic marker association in our analyses. To reduce ethnic heterogeneity, only Caucasian subjects were analyzed. In total, 367 subjects, 134 males and 233 females, were selected from 186 independent families: 38 singleton families; 121 two-sibling families; 23 three-sibling families; 3 four-sibling families; and a single six-sibling family. The actual number of subjects per marker-phenotype analysis varied slightly because of missing genotype and phenotype data. Subjects were not consented for release to public databases. Data may be available for sharing under a confidential agreement between a requestor and the authors. DNA was extracted from blood specimens within 5 days of the draw using Gentra Puregene reagents and protocols (http://www1.qiagen.com). Extracted DNA was quantified using the Pico Green method (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen), and all DNA solutions were normalized to a common concentration for genotyping assays. Genotyping was carried out using the Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo DNA Analysis BeadChip. Genotype generation and quality control were performed by deCODE Genotyping Service (http://www.decode.com/). Because BSA is not normally distributed (skewness and kurtosis: 1.29 and 2.28), it was corrected for non-normality using the Box-Cox transformation (Box and Cox 1964; Venables and Ripley 2002). The scores were then scaled to mean = 0 and SD = 1 to make them comparable essentially as Z-scores. Association tests were performed in R (R Development Core Team 2011) with the lmekin function of the kinship package (Atkinson and Therneau 2008). This function provides a linear mixed-effects model whereby the genetic relatedness among individuals (based on the kinship coefficient) is incorporated into the covariance structure of the random effects. This adjusts the model fit and compensates for the fact that the siblings are related and, therefore, so are their genotypes and phenotypes, which would otherwise violate the assumption of independent observations in a linear regression model. The fixed-effects portion of the model was used for testing the association between a single SNP and BSA. The SNP was treated in R as a factor with three levels (categories), which is similar to coding the major homozygotes as 1/1, the heterozygotes as 0/1, and the minor homozygotes as 0/0. For each SNP, two tests were performed to determine if a given genotype class differed in its average phenotype from the other genotypes. The test compared (a) the major homozygotes (1/1) and the heterozygotes (0/1), and (b) the major homozygotes (1/1) and the minor homozygotes (0/0). Tests (a) and (b) were performed by testing the significance of the regression coefficients from zero, of the heterozygote term and the minor homozygote term, while holding the major homozygote coefficient constant at zero. For rare SNPs, minor homozygote individuals are often not present in the sample, in which case, only test (a) was available for the SNP. In all cases, the Wald test was used to examine the significance of the regression coefficients. The large number of tests performed in the analysis required that the nominal P-values be adjusted for multiple testing. For this, false discovery rate (FDR) q-values were calculated using the method described by Storey and Tibshirani (2003). Drosophila strains were maintained on standard cornmeal/molasses/yeast media at 25\xc2\xb0C and 70% humidity with an approximately 16-hr/8-hr light/dark schedule. All strains were outcrossed for five generations to the Berlin genetic background strain carrying the w1118 eye-color marker. Strain sources were dallyMB950 (MB00950: Bloomington Stock Center), dally80 (Xinhua Lin), dlpf03537 (Exelixis/Harvard), and dlp1 (Scott Selleck). Ethanol-stimulated locomotor activity and sedation kinetics were determined as previously described (Kong et al. 2010; Rothenfluh et al. 2006; Wolf et al. 2002). Ethanol vapor was mixed with a humidified air stream at set ratios to achieve a final flow rate of 5.5 L/min and was delivered to individual exposure chambers, each containing a group of 20 genetically identical flies. For locomotor activity, flies were filmed just prior to and during a 25 min exposure to 47% ethanol vapor. For sedation kinetics, flies were exposed to 67% ethanol vapor, and the number of flies that lost the ability to right themselves was counted at 3 min intervals. All behavioral experiments were repeated on separate days with flies derived from separate crosses. Quantitative PCR was carried out on reverse-transcribed RNA from fly heads according to the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s instructions (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System, using expression levels of RpL32 as a standard to normalize sample concentrations. TaqMan probesets (Applied Biosystems) used in this study were dally: Dm01822385_g1, dlp: Dm01798599_g1, and RpL32: Dm02151827_g1. Ethanol absorption was measured by exposing groups of 25 flies to either ethanol vapor (47%) or humidified air for 30 min. Flies were immediately frozen on dry ice, and the ethanol concentration in whole-fly homogenates was measured with an alcohol dehydrogenase\xe2\x80\x93based spectrophotometric assay (Diagnostic Chemicals, Ltd.). Data analysis followed the logic presented in Figure 1. First, mouse ethanol response QTL were mapped in the recombinant inbred strain BXD, a strain constructed from the parental strains C57/B6 and DBA, which has been extensively phenotyped for alcohol-related behaviors. We limited our analysis to ethanol-induced ataxia as our ultimate goal was to compare the BXD result with human data. Ethanol-induced ataxia is a phenotypic measure held in common between mouse and human. All BXD data and QTL interval mapping were performed using the tools available on the genenetwork.org website as described in Materials and Methods. Twelve phenotypes comparable to the human body sway phenotype were present in the GeneNetwork database and were analyzed (Table 1). Flowchart of the experimental strategy leading to the identification of GPC5 as a participant in ethanol-induced behaviors. Ethanol-induced ataxia QTL were mapped using the Interval Mapping module of GeneNetwork. LRS/LOD scores were calculated using 1000 permutations. The algorithm defines two statistical thresholds, suggestive and significant, as defined by Lander and Kruglyak (1995). While no significant linkages were discovered, 10 of the 12 phenotypes defined 13 suggestive ethanol-induced ataxia QTL (Table 2). All suggestive loci had their syntenic human region tested for genetic association to ethanol-induced anterior-posterior body sway (BSA). Using the comparative genomics functions of Ensembl, all human genes syntenic with the mouse loci were identified. Human subjects had been genotyped previously using the Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo genotyping array. Marker SNPs were chosen for analysis based on location within the genomic limits for the gene\xe2\x80\x99s transcript plus 100 kb flanking the transcription start and stop sites. We thus had markers spanning the transcripts of the syntenic genes plus possible regulatory sequences flanking the transcribed DNA. Each marker SNP was tested for association to BSA using a regression model. False discovery rate q-values were calculated by treating each syntenic locus as a separate hypothesis. The results for each marker are presented in supporting information, Table S1, and the top associated markers are presented in Table 2. GPC5 (glypican 5) became the gene of interest due to the statistical strength of the linkage data in mice and the association data in humans. The BXD linkage yielded a LOD score of 3.9 (P \xe2\x89\x88 1.25E\xe2\x88\x9205), slightly shy of the genome-wide significance value of 4.3 (P \xe2\x89\x88 5.0E\xe2\x88\x9206). Similarly, the multiple test corrected significance value for association to BSA was q = 0.08 (nominal P = 7.54E\xe2\x88\x9205) very close to the standard q = 0.05 threshold for significance. Taken together, these data implicate GPC5 as a candidate QTL that influences ethanol-induced ataxia. To further investigate glypican involvement in ethanol response, mutant alleles of the Drosophila glypican genes dally and dlp were investigated to determine whether they alter Drosophila ethanol response. The six mammalian glypican genes have two homologs in the Drosophila genome. Evolutionarily, dally is thought to be orthologous to the human glypican gene paralogs GPC3 and GPC5, whereas dlp is orthologous to the other four human glypican paralogs (Filmus et al. 2008). We tested both genes in Drosophila, reasoning that homologous gene function as measured by something as complex as behavior may not precisely track with the predicted evolutionary lineage of a gene. Partial loss-of-function alleles of dlp and dally were used in ethanol behavioral assays because they were less afflicted with the developmental defects and lethality caused by strong loss-of-function alleles. Stocks containing partial loss-of-function alleles, either dlpf03537 or dallyMB950, were first outcrossed onto the Berlin genetic background to normalize the genetic background between experimental and control flies. Each allele contains a transposon inserted into the first intron (Figure 2, A and E). dlpf03537 was found to be weakly viable and sterile as a homozygote but without overt morphological or behavioral phenotypes. Transcript levels of dlp in fly heads were reduced by 40% in dlpf03537 heterozygotes (P = 0.0363, n = 3 replicates, two-sample t-test); dlpf03537 failed to complement dlp1 lethality, strong evidence that dlpf03537 is a dlp allele. dallyMB950 was found to be homozygous viable and fertile, and it also had no overt morphological or behavioral phenotypes. Heads of homozygous dallyMB950 flies were shown to have a 27% reduction in dally transcript (P = 0.0218, n = 5 replicates, two-sample t-test), but dallyMB950 complemented the sterility and wing vein morphology phenotypes of the strong loss-of-function allele dally80. Given the molecular evidence that dallyMB950 is an allele of dally, a transposon inserted into the gene coupled with reduced transcript production, we conclude that intragenic complementation is occurring because the dallyMB950 allele provides enough function to complement the phenotype of the strong loss-of-function allele. Drosophila glypican homologs regulate behavioral responses to acute and repeated ethanol exposure. (A) Simplified diagram of the dlp locus. Coding regions are indicated with shaded boxes. The transposon insertion allele dlpf03537 is located in the first intron. Probes for qPCR span the last intron. (B) Ethanol-stimulated locomotion of flies homozygous (left) or heterozygous (right) for f03537 continuously exposed to 47% ethanol vapor (0\xe2\x80\x9325 min, bar on horizontal axis). Control in all experiments was the genetic background strain. Statistical significance (two-sample t-test) was assessed by comparison of the total distance traveled during the hyperactive phase (2\xe2\x80\x9325 min). f03537: n = 5, f03537/+: n = 8. (C) Exposure scheme for inducing and detecting ethanol rapid tolerance. Flies were exposed twice to 67% ethanol vapor with 4 hr between the start of exposures 1 and 2. (D) Sedation sensitivity and tolerance of flies heterozygous for f03537. ST50 is the time to 50% sedation, and sedation tolerance is the difference between the ST50 of exposure 2 (e2) and 1 (e1). Sensitivity and sedation are illustrated by the horizontal bar graphs. *P = 0.0206, **P = 0.0022, two-sample t-test. n = 9. (E) Simplified diagram of the dally locus. (F) Ethanol-stimulated locomotion of flies homozygous (left) or heterozygous (right) for MB950 continuously exposed to 47% ethanol vapor (0\xe2\x80\x9325 min). MB950: n = 7, MB950/+: n = 11. (G) Sedation sensitivity and tolerance of flies homozygous for MB950. ***P = 0.0002, two-sample t-test. n = 7. Ethanol absorption was unaltered in dlp (control: 24.6 mM, f03537/+: 24.2 mM, P = 0.8726, two-sample t-test, n = 6) and dally mutant flies (control: 29.5 mM, MB950: 31.7 mM, P = 0.5231, two-sample t-test, n = 4). Flies carrying the dallyMB950 and dlpf03537 alleles were evaluated for alterations in their response to ethanol. Three assays were performed: locomotor stimulation in response to moderate concentrations of ethanol; sedation in response to higher concentrations of ethanol; and the acquisition of rapid tolerance to ethanol sedation. Flies exposed to a continuous stream of moderate concentration ethanol vapor (47%) exhibit a characteristic pattern of locomotor activity. When ethanol is first introduced, flies show a transient burst of locomotor activity\xe2\x80\x94a startle response to the smell of ethanol (Figure 2, B and F). Activity briefly returns to baseline levels, followed by increasing hyperactivity that coincides with the rising internal concentrations of ethanol (approximately 25 mM at 25 min exposure). As internal ethanol concentration increases, flies become progressively more uncoordinated and eventually they become sedated. Sedation sensitivity is measured using a higher ethanol dose, 67% vapor, which results in 50% sedation after \xe2\x89\x8820 min exposure in control flies (Figure 2, D and G). If ethanol-exposed flies are allowed to rest for 3.5 hr to metabolize absorbed ethanol, reexposed flies take substantially longer to sedate (\xe2\x89\x8832 min for 50% sedation). This acquired resistance to ethanol sedation is termed rapid tolerance and is due to neuro-adaptations to the effects of ethanol intoxication (Scholz et al. 2000; Wolf and Heberlein 2003). The ethanol behavioral responses of dlpf03537 and dallyMB950 flies differed significantly from controls, and they were qualitatively similar to each other. Ethanol-induced locomotor activity in homozygous mutant flies was the most similar response; both mutant strains, as homozygotes, showed significantly reduced ethanol hyperactivity (Figure 2, B and F, left panels). Interestingly, heterozygous mutants showed the opposite result of increased ethanol hyperactivity, but only dlpf03537 heterozygotes showed a significant increase (Figure 2, B and F, right panels). Given that the expression and complementation experiments indicate that transcript levels decrease with the number of mutant alleles, the simple model that ethanol hyperactivity decreases with decreasing transcript is not supported; a more complex relationship between dally and dlp gene expression and ethanol hyperactivity must exist. dallyMB950 and dlpf03537 mutants were also similar in their ethanol sedation sensitivity. Because of the weak viability of dlpf03537 homozygotes, only heterozygotes were generated in sufficient numbers for the sedation assays. The dlpf03537 heterozygotes displayed increased sedation sensitivity (Figure 2D). dallyMB950 heterozygotes and homozygotes were both more sensitive to the sedating effect of ethanol, with the homozygotes exhibiting greater sensitivity (Figure 2G and data not shown). The two mutants differed in their development of rapid tolerance [rapid tolerance was measured as the difference in sedation sensitivity between an initial exposure to ethanol, e1, and a second exposure, e2, delivered four hours later (Figure 2C)]. While dlpf03537 heterozygotes developed greater tolerance, dallyMB950 heterozygotes and homozygotes were indistinguishable from control flies (Figure 2, D and G). Ethanol absorption was unaltered in the mutants (Figure 2 legend), so we can conclude that the behavioral alterations were due to different responses to the same ethanol dose. Our search for genes influencing AUD development first looked for genetic linkage in mice, and we discovered 13 candidate QTL contributing to ethanol-induced ataxia. These hypothetical QTL were examined for genetic associations with alcohol-induced ataxia in humans. With candidate loci as a hypothesis, we reduced the number of statistical tests in comparison with a genome-wide association approach and thus increased the statistical power to detect genetic associations at the human loci. We also obtained greater genetic resolution and human relevance. Human genetic association identified GPC5, a member of the glypican gene family, to be of statistical interest with a multiple-test\xe2\x80\x93corrected FDR q-value of 0.082. We then moved to a Drosophila model system to obtain correlative evidence in an experimental system where mutations can be introduced and tested for their effect on ethanol-induced behaviors. The Drosophila results supported the mammalian genetic results by demonstrating that flies carrying mutant alleles of dally or dlp, the Drosophila homologs of mammalian glypicans, exhibit alterations in ethanol-induced locomotor activity, ethanol-induced sedation, and rapid tolerance to ethanol-induced sedation. Together, these results strongly implicate GPC5 as a contributor to ethanol response. The mammalian glypicans (GPC1 to GPC6) are heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) linked to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Much of what we know about glypican function in mammals was founded upon Drosophila experiments investigating dally and dlp, orthologs of the mammalian 3/5 subfamily and the 1/2/4/6 subfamily, respectively [reviews in Filmus et al. (2008) and Wu et al. (2010)]. Glypicans are involved in modulating cellular signaling, participating in many aspects of normal morphogenesis (including neuronal development and axon guidance) where they regulate the signaling of the Wnt, Hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligands. Consistent with this role in developmental signaling, dysregulation of glypicans has been detected in various cancers (Filmus 2001). GPC5 is developmentally expressed in a pattern consistent with its involvement in central nervous system, limb, and kidney development (Saunders et al. 1997). Because acute ethanol response is brain mediated, only brain expression patterns in mice were considered here in detail. Unlike the majority of glypican family members where expression in embryonic brain is much greater than in adult brain, GPC5 brain expression increases with embryonic age and is highest in adult tissue (Luxardi et al. 2007). GPC5\xe2\x80\xb2s embryonic brain expression is also more spatially restricted than the other glypicans; it is limited to the striatum primordium and ventral diencephalic wall starting about day 10 of embryogenesis (Luxardi et al. 2007). In adults, the greatest expression is seen in the caudate nucleus, the putamen, and the hippocampus (Saunders et al. 1997), structures thought to play a significant role in drug behavior (Koob and Volkow 2010). In flies, both dally and dlp are expressed in the nervous system during development and in adulthood (Chintapalli et al. 2007). In addition to being expressed in brain regions thought to play a role in ethanol response, there is evidence that GPC5 transcription can be modulated by ethanol. After discovering that ethanol-induced expression of Gabra4 in mouse cortical neurons is dependent upon the activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and its binding to an ethanol response sequence element located between exons 1 and 2, Pignataro et al. (2007) performed a microarray screening experiment to identify additional genes whose transcription is activated by ethanol via HSF1. By exposing cortical neurons to ethanol or heat and using microarrays to identify genes whose expression was altered by the treatment, they identified 50 genes that were transcriptionally upregulated in response to ethanol and \xe2\x88\xbc450 genes upregulated in response to heat. The authors highlighted the 9 genes that responded \xe2\x80\x9cdramatically\xe2\x80\x9d (upregulated 50% or greater) to both treatments, a list that includes GPC5. Additionally, we previously found that Drosophila dally expression was transiently increased following exposure to a sedating dose of ethanol (Kong et al. 2010). Glypicans have been shown to participate in organismal development through their interactions with the Wnt, Hedgehog, FGF, and BMP morphogen signaling pathways (Selleck 2000). These developmental pathways have more recently been implicated not only in neural development but also in postdevelopmental synaptic maintenance and plasticity, making them credible participants in neurological, psychiatric, and behavioral phenotypes (Budnik and Salinas 2011; Far\xc3\xadas et al. 2010; Ille and Sommer 2005; Marqu\xc3\xa9s 2005; Okerlund and Cheyette 2011; Salinas 2005). We hypothesize that glypicans modulate these pathways in their neurological functions as they do in their developmental functions. Whereas, prior to this report, there was no experimental literature addressing glypicans\xe2\x80\x99 role in behavior, there are reports of glypicans being involved in human psychiatric conditions: GPC6 is associated with a neuroticism using an age-by-SNP interaction model (Calboli et al. 2010), and GPC1 is a member of a schizophrenia gene network derived from a gene set enrichment analysis of GWA data (Potkin et al. 2010). In summary, we presented evidence that the glypican GPC5 participates in human ethanol response, an endophenotype related to AUD risk. The strength of the evidence is derived from the coalescence of results across different experimental systems: mouse linkage identified the candidate locus, human genetic association identified a single gene contained within the mouse-defined locus, and Drosophila behavior",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

l experiments demonstrated that mutant alleles of the gene identified in mice and humans alter the fly\xe2\x80\x99s ethanol response. In addition to our analyses, the literature on GPC5 reports its expression to be spatially and temporally consistent with a putative involvement in ethanol behaviors, and moreover, its expression can be modulated by ethanol. Finally, the known functions of glypicans as modulators of cell signaling systems that participate in neural development as well as synaptic maintenance and plasticity are also consistent with participation in ethanol-induced behaviors. GPC5 is thus a strong candidate as a gene involved in ethanol response and the development of alcohol use disorders. We thank the many scientists that have contributed data to GeneNetwork.

In wheat (Triticum L. sp.), it was previously shown that allelic variation in the vernalization gene VRN1 was due to deletions or insertions either in the promoter or in the first intron. Here, we report a novel Vrn-B1 allele that has a retrotransposon in its promoter conferring spring growth habit. The VRN-B1 gene was mapped in a doubled haploid population that segregated for winter-spring growth habit but was derived from two spring tetraploid wheat genotypes, the durum wheat (T. turgidum subsp. durum) variety \xe2\x80\x98Lebsock\xe2\x80\x99 and T. turgidum subsp. carthlicum accession PI 94749. Genetic analysis revealed that Lebsock carried the dominant Vrn-A1 and recessive vrn-B1 alleles, whereas PI 94749 had the recessive vrn-A1 and dominant Vrn-B1 alleles. The Vrn-A1 allele in Lebsock was the same as the Vrn-A1c allele previously reported in hexaploid wheat. No differences existed between the vrn-B1 and Vrn-B1 alleles, except that a 5463-bp insertion was detected in the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-UTR region of the Vrn-B1 allele. This insertion was a novel retrotransposon (designated as retrotrans_VRN), which was flanked by a 5-bp target site duplication and contained primer binding site and polypurine tract motifs, a 325-bp long terminal repeat, and an open reading frame encoding 1231 amino acids. The insertion of retrotrans_VRN resulted in expression of Vrn-B1 without vernalization. Retrotrans_VRN is prevalent among T. turgidum subsp. carthlicum accessions, less prevalent among T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum accessions, and rarely found in other tetraploid wheat subspecies.Vernalization genes determine winter/spring growth habit in temperate cereals and are one of the major genetic factors that affect plant life cycle and enable the crop plant to adapt to a wide range of environments (reviewed by Distelfeld et al. 2009; Rousset et al. 2011; Golovnina et al. 2010). On the basis of vernalization requirement, wheat (Triticum L. sp.) crops are traditionally divided into winter and spring wheat. Winter wheat requires an exposure to a period of low temperatures to induce flowering, whereas spring wheat precludes the requirement for low temperatures to flower (Stelmakh 1987). Increasing our understanding of allelic variation in vernalization genes will be useful for more effective development of wheat cultivars adapted to various environments. In diploid wheat (T. monococcum L., 2n = 2x = 14, AmAm) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L., 2n = 2x = 14, HH), vernalization is controlled by at least three genes, VRN1, VRN2, and VRN3 (Takahashi and Yasuda 1971; Tranquilli and Dubcovsky 2000; Yan et al. 2004b, 2006; Hemming et al. 2009). In hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum L, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD), the three homoeologues of the VRN1 gene, VRN-A1, VRN-B1, and VRN-D1 on the long arms of chromosomes 5A, 5B, and 5D, respectively, are major genes determining growth habit (Pugsley 1971; Law et al. 1976; Worland 1996; Dubcovsky et al. 1998; Snape et al. 2001; Barrett et al. 2002; Danyluk et al. 2003; Leonova et al. 2003; Trevaskis et al. 2003; Yan et al. 2003, 2004a; Fu et al. 2005). A dominant allele for any one of the three genes leads to spring growth habit regardless of the allelic state of the other vernalization genes, but the presence of recessive alleles for all three genes leads to winter growth habit (Tranquilli and Dubcovsky 2000; Yan et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2008). VRN1 is an ortholog of the Arabidopsis meristem identity gene AP1 (Danyluk et al. 2003; Murai et al. 2003; Trevaskis et al. 2003; Yan et al. 2003), which encodes a MADS-box protein and is responsible for the initiation of the transition from vegetative to reproductive apices in Arabidopsis (Mandel et al. 1992). As one of a few genes that have been successfully cloned in wheat, VRN1 and its allelic variants have been extensively studied. The dominant Vrn-A1 allele for spring growth habit originated from mutations either in the promoter or in the first intron of a recessive vrn-A1 allele for wild-type winter growth habit in diploid, tetraploid (T. turgidum L., 2n = 4x = 28, AABB), and hexaploid wheat (Yan et al. 2004a; Fu et al. 2005; Dubcovsky et al. 2006; Pidal et al. 2009). In the promoter region, different lengths of deletions (Vrn-Am1a, Vrn-Am1b, Vrn-Am1g) and a 1-bp deletion (Vrn-Am1f) in the CArG-box were identified in Vrn-Am1 of T. monococcum (Yan et al. 2003; Dubcovsky et al. 2006; Pidal et al. 2009). In addition to similar deletions (Vrn-A1d and Vrn-A1e) in the CArG-box region, a deletion in the VRN-box (Vrn-A1b) was found in tetraploid wheat (Yan et al. 2004a; Pidal et al. 2009). In hexaploid wheat, most spring cultivars carry a dominant Vrn-A1a allele that has a duplicated MITE insertion in the VRN-box (Yan et al. 2004a). On the contrary, the dominant Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 alleles do not harbor variation in their promoter regions, but they contain large deletions in the first intron in tetraploid wheat and hexaploid wheat (Yan et al. 2004a; Fu et al. 2005). In this study, we discovered a novel allele of the dominant Vrn-B1 gene in tetraploid wheat as a result of mapping genetic loci associated with growth habit in a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from two spring tetraploid wheat genotypes, a cultivar \xe2\x80\x98Lebsock\xe2\x80\x99 of durum wheat [T. turgidum subsp. durum (Desf.) Husnot, 2n = 4x = 28, AABB] and an accession (PI 94749) of T. turgidum subsp. carthlicum (Nevski in Kom.) \xc3\x81. L\xc3\xb6ve & D. L\xc3\xb6ve (2n = 4x = 28, AABB). Variation between the Vrn-B1 and vrn-B1 alleles that segregate in this population was exclusive to a retrotransposon insertion in the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-untranslated region (UTR) of the Vrn-B1 allele in PI 94749. Molecular markers were developed to determine the frequencies of the dominant Vrn-B1 and recessive vrn-B1 alleles in a global collection of tetraploid wheat. The evolutionary mechanism that induced the allelic variation and resulted in a conversion of winter to spring growth habit in tetraploid wheat is discussed.'","b'Vernalization genes determine winter/spring growth habit in temperate cereals and play important roles in plant development and environmental adaptation.

Molecular markers were developed to determine the frequencies of the dominant Vrn-B1 and recessive vrn-B1 alleles in a global collection of tetraploid wheat. The evolutionary mechanism that induced the allelic variation and resulted in a conversion of winter to spring growth habit in tetraploid wheat is discussed. A DH population (hereafter referred as to LP749), consisting of 146 lines derived from a cross between Lebsock and PI 94749 (Chu et al. 2010), was used to identify genes responsible for growth habit within the population (supporting information, Table S1). The F1 and F2 plants from the cross between Lebsock and PI 94749 and two backcross populations (Lebsock/PI 94749//Lebsock and Lebsock/2*PI 94749) were then generated to evaluate the genetic effects of each identified gene in the DH population. Growth habit was evaluated following the procedures described in Yan et al. (2003). Plants of LP749, two parental lines, F1 hybrids, and F2 and backcross populations were grown in a greenhouse at 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0 without vernalization and under a 16 h photoperiod by providing additional artificial light. Under this temperature-photoperiod\xe2\x80\x93controlled regime, plants that flowered within two months after planting were classified as spring types, and plants that were still in vegetative growth one month after the spring plants flowered were characterized as winter types. The winter-type plants were then vernalized to induce flowering and seed production. More than 20 plants for each of the two parental lines and their F1 hybrids were tested in three greenhouse seasons. Evaluation included 200 plants for the F2 population and 100 plants for each of the two BC1F2 populations. For the DH lines, growth habit was evaluated in two greenhouse seasons. The linkage maps previously developed for the LP749 population (Chu et al. 2010) were used in this study. For QTL analysis, a subset of 188 markers that were spaced greater than 2 cM apart and gave the most complete genome coverage was used, and values of 0 and 1 were assigned to spring and winter growth habits, respectively. Composite interval-regression mapping (CIM) was performed using the computer program Map Manager QTX (Manly et al. 2001) to evaluate marker intervals associated with growth habit. A permutation test with 5000 permutations indicated that a logarithm of the odds (LOD) threshold of 2.91 in this population yielded an experiment-wise significance level of 0.05. Markers with significant (P < 0.001) main effects were tested against all other markers (Manly et al. 2001) in the dataset to identify significant (P < 10\xe2\x88\x926) interactions among QTL. Allelic variation in the VRN-A1 and VRN-B1 genes is mostly confined to the promoter regions and the first introns of the genes (Fu et al. 2005; Yan et al. 2004a; Pidal et al. 2009), and 10 pairs of primers that were designed from those regions were used in this study (Table 1). In addition, several primers were designed to amplify the VRN-A1 and VRN-B1 genes based on the conserved sequence between Vrn-Am1 (BAC 231A16 of T. monococcum accession DV92, GenBank ID AY188331) (Yan et al. 2003) or VRN-A1 (BAC 1226C17, GenBank ID AY616452) and VRN-B1 (BAC 1225D16, GenBank ID AY616453) of durum wheat \xe2\x80\x98Langdon\xe2\x80\x99 (Yan et al. 2004a). In addition to these, several primers specific to VRN-B1 were designed to identify allelic variation in VRN-B1 (Table 1). Total genomic DNA was isolated from leaves (Faris et al. 2000), and the DNA concentration was adjusted to 50\xe2\x80\x93100 ng/\xc2\xb5l for PCR reactions. For DNA fragments of less than 2 kb, a total volume of 15 \xc2\xb5l per PCR reaction was conducted, which contained 200 nM of each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 unit Taq polymerase (Qiagen Sciences Inc., Germantown, MD), and 100\xe2\x80\x93200 ng of template DNA. The amplification was performed at 94\xc2\xb0 for 4 min, followed by 40 cycles, each consisting of 30 sec at 94\xc2\xb0, 45 sec at 50\xe2\x80\x9360\xc2\xb0 (depending on the annealing temperatures of primers), 45\xe2\x80\x9390 sec at 72\xc2\xb0 (depending on the size of the products with a rate of 1 min per kb), and a final extension step of 10 min at 72\xc2\xb0. For PCR products greater than 2 kb, a total volume of 25 \xc2\xb5l per reaction was performed using the LongAmp Taq polymerase kit (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich, MA), and 200\xe2\x80\x93400 ng of template DNA was applied in each reaction. PCR amplification was performed at 94\xc2\xb0 for 30 sec, followed by 30 cycles, each consisting of 20 sec at 94\xc2\xb0, 20 sec at 55\xe2\x80\x9358\xc2\xb0, 5\xe2\x80\x9310 min at 65\xc2\xb0 (time estimated based on the rate of 50 sec/kb), and a final extension step of 10 min at 65\xc2\xb0. PCR products were mixed with 3 \xc2\xb5l loading buffer (40% sucrose, 0.2% bromophenol blue) for electrophoresis, which was carried out on 0.8\xe2\x80\x931% agarose gels in 1\xc3\x97 TAE buffer at 80 W for 1\xe2\x80\x931.5 h. Gels were stained using 0.001% GelRed (Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA) for 10 min and visualized using a Gel Logic 200 imaging system (Kodak Inc., New Haven, CT). PCR products of the VRN-B1 gene were purified with the Qiagen spin miniprep kit (Qiagen Sciences Inc.), cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA), and then sequenced by the DNA Facility at Iowa State University (Ames, Iowa). PCR markers for VRN-A1 and VRN-B1 were developed to analyze the LP749 population. The new markers were evaluated for linkage with the previously mapped SSR markers (Chu et al. 2010) using the computer program MAPMAKER (V2.0) for Macintosh (Lander et al. 1987) with a minimum LOD threshold of 3.0 and the Kosambi mapping function (Kosambi 1944). The newly developed VRN-B1 markers were used to investigate the frequency of the dominant and recessive alleles in 154 spring accessions/lines of six domesticated tetraploid wheat subspecies, including durum wheat, T. turgidum subsp. carthlicum, T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum (Schrank ex Sch\xc3\xbcbler) Thell., T. turgidum subsp. polonicum (L.) Thell., T. turgidum subsp. turanicum (Jakubz.) \xc3\x81. L\xc3\xb6ve & D. L\xc3\xb6ve, and T. turgidum subsp. turgidum (Table S2). For accessions that carried the retrotransposon insertion as indicated by the Vrn-B1 marker, the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 ends of the insertion were sequenced. The 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the insertion was amplified using primers VBINS2F (5\xe2\x80\xb2-CTCACCCAACCACCTGACAGC-3\xe2\x80\xb2) and VBINS2R (5\xe2\x80\xb2-ATCCGCCCCACTTGGGATT-3\xe2\x80\xb2), and the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the insertion was amplified using primers VBINS5F (5\xe2\x80\xb2-CAACCAGAGGCAATTCTGGACAC-3\xe2\x80\xb2) and VRNBPR1 (5\xe2\x80\xb2-GCCCCATCTCCGCTGGAGAACG-3\xe2\x80\xb2). The web-based computer program GenScan at GeniusNet (http://genome.dkfz-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/GENSCAN/genscan.cgi) was used to predict the open reading frame and deduce the encoded amino acid sequences. The primer binding site (PBS) was identified by aligning the sequence downstream of the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 long terminal repeat (LTR) to that of 3\xe2\x80\xb2 regions of tRNAs. The polypurine tract (PPT) was identified by examining the purine-rich region upstream of the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 LTR. The web-based computer program RPS-BLAST (reverse position-specific BLAST) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/docs/cdd_search.html) was used to identify conserved domains in the deduced amino acid sequences. To determine whether the insertion in the PI 94749 Vrn-B1 was the only difference compared with the Lebsock vrn-B1 allele, the complete gene, including the 27-bp UTL upstream from the start codon, the 44-bp UTL downstream from the stop codon, and 12,343 bp between the start codon and the stop codon, was cloned for sequence analysis. For convenience of cloning, this large gene was divided into three fragments. The first fragment accounted for the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-UTR region of 27 bp, exon 1, and 4778 bp of intron 1, and was amplified by primers VRN-A1F1 (5\xe2\x80\xb2-TAGGGTTGGCCCGGTTCTC-3\xe2\x80\xb2) and VRNB1-C1-R7 (5\xe2\x80\xb2-AGGCCGACGCCTTGTGAC-3\xe2\x80\xb2). The second fragment, which spanned most of intron 1, consisted of 4927 bp that overlapped 917 bp with the first fragment and was amplified by primers VRNB1-C1-F6 (5\xe2\x80\xb2-ACCGCACTCCTAACCCACTA-3\xe2\x80\xb2) and VRNB1-C2-R2 (5\xe2\x80\xb2-ATGCCTAGATAAGTAGGACGATACGA-3\xe2\x80\xb2). The third fragment spanned 3069 bp of intron 1, which overlapped 2192 bp with the second fragment, and the remaining region, including 7 exons and 6 introns. The third fragment was amplified by primers VRNB1-INT1-F4 (5\xe2\x80\xb2-TCCCTAAAGAAAGATCGGAAGAC-3\xe2\x80\xb2) and VRNB1-3end-R3 (5\xe2\x80\xb2-GTTACTCTCTACTGAATAGTACGCTTA-3\xe2\x80\xb2). These primers specific to VRN-B1 were designed by comparison of VRN-A1 (AY616452) and VRN-B1 (AY616453) of Langdon (Yan et al. 2004a), and the sizes of PCR products were estimated based on the sequence of the VRN-B1 gene. For gene expression experiments, the two parents along with 16 spring DH lines carrying either Vrn-A1 or Vrn-B1 or both and 8 winter DH lines carrying recessive vrn-A1 and vrn-B1 alleles were grown in the greenhouse under constant temperature (20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0) and long day length (16 h light). For each of the winter DH lines, five plants were vernalized by treating them for 6 weeks at 4\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xb0 and 16 h day length, and another five plants were not vernalized and kept in the greenhouse as controls. For detecting transcripts of VRN-A1 and VRN-B1, leaf samples from all tested lines were collected at 9:00 am to avoid potential effect of the VRN-1 diurnal expression pattern reported by Shimada et al. (2009). Total RNA was extracted using the TRIZOL method (Invitrogen Inc.) (Yan et al. 2003) from leaves at the third leaf stage, and the two conserved primers, Ex4-5_F1 and Ex8_R1 specific for VRN-A1 and VRN-B1, respectively, were used to simultaneously amplify their transcripts using the protocol described previously (Loukoianov et al. 2005). The mixed VRN-A1 and VRN-B1 transcripts were separated and distinguished by digesting the PCR products with restriction enzyme HinfI, which resulted in undigested PCR products for VRN-A1 (313 bp) and digested PCR products for VRN-B1 (173 bp + 110 bp + 30 bp) (Loukoianov et al. 2005). Because no transcripts were observed in the unvernalized winter DH lines at the third leaf stage, RNA samples were also collected at the seventh and ninth leaf stages for these lines. The VRN-A1 and VRN-B1 transcripts were further investigated in the winter DH lines that were vernalized for six weeks. In addition, the primer pair specific for actin (ACTIN, forward: TGTGGATATCAGGAAGGA and reverse: CTCATACGGTCAGCAATAC) (Yan et al. 2003), which produced a cDNA fragment of 85 bp, was used as an endogenous control for detecting transcripts. Of 146 DH lines generated from two spring parents, 101 were spring type and 45 were winter type (Table 2 and Table S1), indicating winter growth habit was restored due to homoeoallelic recombination of genes controlling growth habit. The observed segregation ratio was not significantly different from a 3:1 ratio (\xcf\x872df = 1 = 2.64, P = 0.10) and fit a two-gene model. CIM revealed that two QTL were significantly associated with growth habit and centered at the VRN-A1 and VRN-B1 loci on chromosome arms 5AL and 5BL, respectively (Figure 1). The VRN-A1 and VRN-B1 QTL had LOD values of 19.67 and 19.45, respectively, and they each explained 30% of the total phenotypic variation. No other major loci for growth habit were detected in this population. QTL mapping for growth habit segregation in the Lebsock \xc3\x97 PI 94749\xe2\x80\x93derived DH population. QTL analysis was performed with composite interval mapping using the computer program Map Manager QTX (Manly et al. 2001). The positions of marker loci are shown to the left of each linkage group and centiMorgan (cM) distances between loci are shown along the right. The vertical dotted line indicates the logarithm of the odds (LOD) significance threshold of 2.91. R2 and LOD values are 0.30 and 19.67 for the QTL on chromosome 5AL (left), and 0.30 and 19.45 for the QTL on chromosome 5BL (right), respectively. The parental lines and their F1 hybrids were all spring type (Table 2), indicating that spring type was dominant and that the two parents each carried only one, but different, dominant allele of either Vrn-A1 or Vrn-B1. Among 200 F2 plants, 187 were spring type and 13 were winter type (Table 2), and the segregation fit a 15:1 ratio (\xcf\x872df = 1 = 0.02, P = 0.88). In the two BC1F2 populations, each consisting of 100 plants, no winter-type plants were observed (Table 2). Therefore, the results of the QTL analysis in the LP749 population combined with the results from the F1 plants and the F2 and BC1F2 populations demonstrated that the genotypes of Lebsock and PI 94749 were Vrn-A1Vrn-A1vrn-B1vrn-B1 and vrn-A1vrn-A1Vrn-B1Vrn-B1, respectively. The paired primers VRN1AF and VRN1AR (Table 1) were used to detect allelic variation in the promoter region of VRN-A1 between Lebsock and PI 94749. A 484-bp fragment was amplified in both parental lines. Sequencing results confirmed that they had the same DNA sequences as the recessive vrn-A1 allele (Figure S1). However, the paired primers Ex1/C/F and Intrl/A/R3 (Table 1) produced an expected 522-bp fragment in Lebsock (Figure 2A), which demonstrated the presence of the large deletion within the first intron of the Vrn-A1 allele, whereas primer pair Intrl/C/F and Intrl/AB/R (Table 1) generated the expected 1068-bp fragment in PI 94749 (Figure 2B), which demonstrated the absence of this large deletion in the vrn-A1 allele. Both primer pairs were then used to genotype all DH lines in LP749, and VRN-A1 mapped to a location that defined the peak of the QTL on chromosome 5AL as expected (Figure 1). Markers for allelic variation in the first intron of VRN-A1. PCR products were amplified by primer pairs Ex1/C/F and Intr1/A/R3 (A) and Intr1/C/F and Intr1/AB/R (B) for detecting presence and absence of the large deletion in the first intron of VRN-A1, respectively. Lanes: M = size standard; L = Lebsock; P = PI 94749; VA and va are DH lines carrying dominant and recessive VRN-A1, respectively. Arrows indicate the expected size of the products. The two primer pairs Intr1/B/F and Intr1/B/R3 and Intr1/B/F and Intr1/B/R4 (Table 1), which had been used to detect the presence/absence of a large deletion in intron 1 of the VRN-B1 allele (Fu et al. 2005), were used to analyze Lebsock and PI 94749, but no polymorphic products were observed. Sequencing results confirmed that both Lebsock and PI 94749 had the same 1149-bp fragment (Figure S2) of the vrn-B1 allele as in Langdon (GenBank ID AY747602) (Fu et al. 2005). Therefore, no allelic variation within intron 1 was found between the Vrn-B1 allele in PI 94749 and the vrn-B1 allele in Lebsock. To determine whether allelic variation existed between the promoter regions of Vrn-B1 and vrn-B1, PCR analysis was conducted using the primers pair VRNBPF1 and VRNBPR1 (Table 1). However, only Lebsock yielded an amplified product, which was 989 bp in size (Figure 3A). Sequencing results indicated that the fragment from Lebsock had the same sequence as the reported VRN-B1 in Langdon (GenBank ID AY616453) (Yan et al. 2004a) (Figure S3). This primer pair was then used to genotype all DH lines, and the 989-bp fragment was amplified only in the lines carrying the vrn-B1 allele (Figure 3A), which facilitated mapping of the VRN-B1 gene in the DH population (Figure 1). Markers for allelic variation in VRN-B1. PCR products were amplified by primer pairs VRNBPF1 and VRNBPR1 (A), VRNBPF3 and VRNBPR1 (B), and VRNBPF1 and VBINSR1 (C). Lanes: M = size standard; L = Lebsock; P = PI 94749; VB and vb are DH lines carrying dominant and recessive VRN-B1, respectively. Arrows indicate the expected polymorphic PCR products. To understand why PI 94749 did not yield a product when amplified with VRNBPF1/VRNBPR1, a new primer (VRNBPR2) (Table 1) located 95 bp upstream of VRNBPR1, was combined with the primer VRNBPF1 for PCR. This primer pair produced the same expected 872-bp fragment in both Lebsock and PI 94749 (Figure S4), indicating that no differences existed in the region between VRNBPF1 and VRNBPR2 of the VRN-B1 gene. PCR results using the primer pair VRNBPF2 and VRNBPR3 (Table 1), which are located 3 bp upstream and 582 bp downstream of VRNBPR1, respectively, also indicated that Lebsock and PI 94749 had the same expected 647-bp amplicon. Primers VRNBPR2 and VRNBPF2 were 72 bp apart in vrn-B1 in Lebsock, but they failed to amplify the expected PCR product in PI 94749. We hypothesized that a large insertion might be located between VRNBPF1 and VRNBPR2 in the Vrn-B1 allele in PI 94749. To test this hypothesis, a long-range PCR reaction, including primers VRNBPF3 (with sequence overlapped with VRNBPR2) and VRNBPR1, was conducted. A 5.5-kb fragment was amplified in PI 94749 and a DH line carrying the dominant Vrn-B1 allele but not in Lebsock or a DH line carrying the recessive vrn-B1 allele (Figure 3B). Sequencing of the 5.5-kb fragment from PI 94749 verified that the dominant Vrn-B1 allele had an insertion of 5463 bp in the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-UTR region (Figure 4). PI 94749 had duplicated CTCCG motifs flanking the insertion, whereas Lebsock had only one copy of this motif (Figure 4 and Figure S5). The 5-bp sequence CTCCG is a typical target site duplication (TSD) sequence for a retrotransposable element (retrotransposon) to insert in a new site of the genome (Han et al. 2010). A 325-bp LTR was found within the insertion, each having a short inverted repeat 5\xe2\x80\xb2-TG...CA-3\xe2\x80\xb2 at both ends (Figure S5). Another striking feature of this retrotransposon is the presence of PBS and PPT motifs (Figure 4 and Figure S5). Position and structure of retrotrans_VRN identified in the dominant Vrn-B1 allele of PI 94749. The aligned sequences were from positions at VRN-box to ATG start codon in PI 94749 (PI) and Lebsock (LB). The VRN-box and CArG-box are framed and shown in blue and pink, respectively. The ATG start codon is underlined. The duplicated target site CTCCG is shown in red with the position of retrotrans_VRN indicated by a red triangle. Positions of the primer binding site (PBS) and polypurine tract (PPT), long terminal repeat (LTR), and the coding region are all indicated. The numbers \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92202\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92101\xe2\x80\x9d indicate the start base positions in each line relative to start codon, and \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92100\xe2\x80\x9d indicates the end base position in each line relative to the start codon. The DNA sequence of the 5.5-kb insertion in the dominant Vrn-B1 allele in PI 94749 is deposited in the EMBL/GenBank Data Libraries under accession no. HQ186251. An open reading frame in the 5463-bp insertion that encoded a total of 1231 amino acids was predicted (Figure S5 and Figure S6). Searches of the deduced amino acid sequence against the NCBI nonredundant protein database (nr) (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db) showed that it had 63% similarity to a rice retrotransposon (CAD40278) along the whole predicted protein sequence, which included multiple conserved domains, such as retropepsin, retrotrans_gag, and a Gypsy family of RNase H (Figure 4). No other wheat or grass sequences had significant homology to the nucleic acid or deduced amino acid sequences associated with this 5.5-kb insertion. The new retrotransposon in the Vrn-B1 allele is designated retrotrans_VRN (GenBank ID HQ186251). To determine whether the retrotrans_VRN insertion was the only difference between Vrn-B1 in PI 94749 and vrn-B1 in Lebsock, the complete gene from each parent was sequenced. A total of 13,347 bp, including 960 bp upstream from the start codon, 12,343 bp from the start codon to the stop codon, and 44 bp downstream from the stop codon, was determined for the recessive vrn-B1 allele (GenBank ID JN817431). The dominant Vrn-B1 allele (GenBank ID JN817430) was exactly the same as the recessive vrn-B1 allele in the sequenced region. Therefore, the retrotrans_VRN insertion was the only difference between the PI 94749 Vrn-B1 allele and the Lebsock vrn-B1 allele. The primer VBINSR1 (Table 1), which was close to the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 end of the retrotrans_VRN insertion but 42 bp downstream from VRNBPF3, was paired with VRNBPF1 to genotype all DH lines. The expected 928-bp fragment was produced only in PI 94749 and those DH lines carrying the Vrn-B1 allele (Figure 3C). Therefore, this primer pair was used to observe the presence of retrotrans_VRN in Vrn-B1, whereas the primer pair VRNBPF1 and VRNBPR1 was used to detect the absence of retrotrans_VRN in vrn-B1. The above two primer pairs were used to determine the frequency of the Vrn-B1 allele containing retrotrans_VRN in 154 spring-type accessions/lines from six T. turgidum subspecies (Table 2). No accessions/lines from subspecies durum, polonicum, turanicum, or turgidum were found to carry retrotrans_VRN. However, 19 of 22 T. turgidum subsp. carthlicum accessions and 3 of 30 T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum accessions had retrotrans_VRN (Table 3 and Table S2). These results indicated that the dominant Vrn-B1 allele containing retrotrans_VRN is frequent among T. turgidum subsp. carthlicum accessions, is much less frequent among T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum accessions, and is rare among other tetraploid wheat subspecies. The accessions carrying retrotrans_VRN had no specific geographical distribution, suggesting that the insertion of retrotrans_VRN in Vrn-B1 occurred before the accessions spread worldwide. Sequencing results showed that these 22 accessions carrying retrotrans_VRN had the same sequences as PI 94749 at the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 LTRs of retrotrans_VRN (Figure S7). Under the same greenhouse conditions without vernalization, 75 plants from 16 spring DH lines carrying the dominant allele(s) of Vrn-A1, or Vrn-B1, or both, flowered at 43\xe2\x80\x9364 days with an average of 54 days after planting, whereas 32 plants from 8 winter DH lines carrying both vrn-A1 and vrn-B1 alleles flowered at 89\xe2\x80\x93145 days with an average of 123 days after planting. Several unvernalized plants did not flower even 145 days after planting when the experiment was terminated (Table S3). On average, vernalization decreased flowering time by 35 days compared with plants of the same lines that did not undergo vernalization (Table S3). In spring DH lines carrying both dominant Vrn-A1 and Vrn-B1 (retrotrans_VRN) alleles, transcripts from both Vrn-A1 and Vrn-B1 were observed in leaves at the third leaf stage (Figure 5), whereas in Lebsock and the spring DH lines carrying the dominant Vrn-A1 and the recessive vrn-B1 alleles, transcripts were only observed from Vrn-A1 but not from vrn-B1 (Figure 5). Similarly, in PI 94749 and the spring DH lines carrying the recessive vrn-A1 allele and the dominant Vrn-B1 alleles, transcripts were observed from Vrn-B1 but not from vrn-A1 (Figure 5). No transcripts were detected from the recessive allele of either vrn-A1 or vrn-B1 in the winter DH lines in leaves at the third, seventh, or ninth leaf stages (Figure 5). However, after the winter lines were vernalized for six weeks, transcripts from both vrn-A1 and vrn-B1 were detectable (Figure 5).

(Lower gel) Actin was expressed at the same level in each of the lines carrying different VRN-1 alleles. Lanes: M = size standard; L = Lebsock; P = PI 94749; vernalized and unvernalized indicates plants with or without cold treatment at 4\xe2\x80\x936\xc2\xb0 for six weeks, respectively. VAVB, VAvb, vaVB, and vavb indicate DH lines having genotype of Vrn-A1Vrn-A1Vrn-B1Vrn-B1, Vrn-A1Vrn-A1vrn-B1vrn-B1, vrn-A1vrn-A1Vrn-B1Vrn-B1, and vrn-A1vrn-A1vrn-B1vrn-B1, accordingly. The third and ninth mean leaf samples were taken at the third and ninth leaf stages, respectively. In the present study, we analyzed a DH population derived from two tetraploid wheat lines with spring growth habit and subsequent F2 and BC1F2 populations, and we found that the VRN-A1 and VRN-B1 genes controlled the segregation of growth habit. The durum cultivar Lebsock carried the dominant Vrn-A1 and the recessive vrn-B1 alleles, whereas PI 94749 had the recessive vrn-A1 and the dominant Vrn-B1 alleles. Because one dominant gene, either Vrn-A1 or Vrn-B1, was sufficient to confer spring growth habit in the parental lines, the appearance of winter lines in the LP749 population was due to the homoeoallelic recombination. All of the DH lines with the double-recessive genotype (vrn-A1vrn-B1) had winter growth habit, demonstrating the decisive role of the VRN1 gene in determining winter/spring growth habit in tetraploid wheat. Alleles with variation in the first intron of VRN-A1 are the same for tetraploid and hexaploid wheat (Fu et al. 2005). However, the allelic variant of VRN-B1 identified in tetraploid wheat in this study is different from that previously reported in hexaploid wheat. Allelic variation in VRN-B1 was reported to occur in intron 1 due to a large deletion in the dominant allele in extensive spring cultivars (Fu et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2008), and no allelic variation in this gene was reported in its promoter or any other region. In this study, no variation was observed within the first intron of dominant and recessive VRN-B1 alleles. Instead, the variation in VRN-B1 was due to the insertion of the retrotrans_VRN element within the 5\xe2\x80\xb2 UTR of Vrn-B1 in a position near the corresponding CArG-box and VRN-box regulatory sites of VRN-A1 in diploid and hexaploid wheat (Yan et al. 2003, 2004a; Dubcovsky et al. 2006; Pidal et al. 2009). Kane et al. (2007) reported that the MADS-box transcription factor TaVRT2 binds the CArG-box in the promoter region of the recessive vrn1 allele. Li and Dubcovsky (2008) showed that TaFDL2, a functional homolog of Arabidopsis FD, can also interact with the promoter of the recessive vrn1 allele. In both cases vrn1 cannot be transcribed due to the binding of these transcriptional repressor(s) in the promoter region. Therefore, homozygous recessive vrn1 cannot flower without vernalization. Deletions in the promoter region disrupt the ability of repressors to bind, allowing Vrn1 to be transcribed and function in a dominant fashion, which results in spring growth habit (Yan et al. 2003; Dubcovsky et al. 2006; Pidal ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

t al. 2009). In the same way, the insertion of retrotrans_VRN in the critical promoter region of the recessive vrn-B1 allele may disrupt repressor binding, allowing the gene to be transcribed. The gene expression experiment proved that the Vrn-B1 allele containing retrotrans_VRN was transcribed and the spring lines carrying the Vrn-B1 allele flowered without vernalization. In the winter DH lines carrying the recessive vrn-B1 allele, vrn-B1 transcripts were detected only after plants were vernalized, and the vernalized plants flowered earlier than those without vernalization treatment did. Most insertions have deleterious effects on the expression of nearby genes in plants (Hollister et al. 2011). On the contrary, this study provides an example of an insertion that resulted in the liberation of gene expression. Mutation of the VRN-B1 gene is the mechanism by which tetraploid wheat evolved from the winter wild type to spring type. A survey of 154 spring-type accessions/lines of six T. turgidum subspecies indicated that none of the accessions from the subspecies durum, polonicum, turanicum, or turgidum had retrotrans_VRN in VRN-B1, but the insertion was present in some accessions of T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum and in most accessions of T. turgidum subsp. carthlicum. This suggested that the insertion event in the dominant Vrn-B1 allele might have occurred during the evolution of tetraploid wheat and may have contributed to adaptation to certain environments. Identification of the VRN-B1 allele in a global collection of tetraploid wheat could provide important molecular information for wheat breeding. Both T. turgidum subsp. carthlicum and T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum are potentially important sources for improving resistance to tan spot and Stagonospora nodorum blotch (Chu et al. 2008a), Fusarium head blight (Oliver et al. 2008), and stem rust (Olivera Firpo et al. 2010) for durum and bread wheat grown in North America. Molecular identification of the dominant gene for spring growth habit will facilitate selection of the proper wheat parents to breed cultivars for specific environments or to develop spring populations that do not have a vernalization requirement. Effects of different VRN1 genes on heading date have been studied extensively in spring wheat (Law et al. 1976; Stelmakh 1993; Kato et al. 1999; T\xc3\xb3th et al. 2003; Hanocq et al. 2004; Chu et al. 2008b). The dominant Vrn-A1 allele normally provides complete insensitivity to vernalization; thus, it is considered the most potent for spring growth habit, whereas a dominant Vrn-B1 or Vrn-D1 allele may result in the partial elimination of the vernalization requirement (Pugsley 1971, 1972; Stelmakh 1993). Vrn-A1 is indeed expressed at earlier and higher levels than Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 in Triple Dirk isogenic lines (Loukoianov et al. 2005). The Triple Dirk A (TDA) line carrying the dominant Vrn-A1 allele flowered several days earlier than the Triple Dirk B (TDB) line carrying the dominant Vrn-B1 allele and the Triple Dirk E (TDE) line carrying the dominant Vrn-D1 allele (Trevaskis et al. 2003; Loukoianov et al. 2005). In this study, PI 94749, which harbors only the dominant Vrn-B1 allele, headed up to two weeks later than Lebsock, which had only the dominant Vrn-A1 allele (Table S3). However, in the DH population, the lines that carried only the dominant Vrn-B1 allele had similar heading dates as the lines that only carried the dominant Vrn-A1 (Table S3). It seems that the effect of the retrotrans_VRN\xe2\x80\x93containing Vrn-B1 allele on growth habit might be similar to that of Vrn-A1 in tetraploid wheat. No further experiments were conducted to explain variation in flowering within the spring or winter groups, as this research was focused on the identification of allelic variation between winter lines that had a vernalization requirement and spring lines that lacked this requirement for flowering.
